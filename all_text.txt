pd flash 6 record of processing activities to concretely measure the impact of the gdpr on our activities it was necessary to identify precisely the processing of personal data performed by each department within mane group at headquarters and in the subsidiaries keeping a register of personal data processing allows us to map our processing and to justify our personal data processing in the personal data processing register it is necessary to identify precisely the different processing of personal data the categories of personal data processed the objectives pursued by the data processing operations the persons internal or external who process this data the chain of custody of personal data in particular to identify any data transfers outside the european union in order to keep this mapping of personal data processed by the mane group up to date the participation of each department and each subsidiary in the inventory declaration and updating of processing operations is fundamental it is therefore up to each service or subsidiary through its dp coordinator to transmit its personal data processing registration to the dpo at the address dpomanecom using the validation procedure for the processing of personal data file as an attachment for remindersupply terms conditions playbook these supply tcs playbook guidelines are intended to cover the review of contracts proposed by counterparties more and more in the form of general specifications or quality agreements etc and the review of amendments to manes supply agreement proposals that are made by counterparties our very first concern is liability a provision to limit it is compulsory in any document under which mane commits to sells products other key concerns are ipr applicable law exclusivity warranty liability the mandatory provision liability cap we must always have a cap of some kind related to the turnover for mane try first to limit to the amount of the order or 50 of the amount of the products invoiced in the year preceding the claim then we can escalate to the amount of products invoiced in the preceding year if the customer continues to push then we should continue to push back arguing for the legitimacy of a cap arguments for the cap mane does not sign supply agreements without a limitation of liability it is standard in our industry and other industries for the component supplier to cap its liability a cap establishes a proportion between the commercial relationship ie revenues achieved and the risk that mane must accept reflects risk sharing rather than risk transfer particularly as the customer inspected the products and accepted them for use mane cannot take on the full liability for the customers products in the market the customer has sole discretion over whether and how to process the products and where and how to market and sell its products that incorporate manes products the consumer market is not manes business and we dont achieve the revenues that correspond to the products in the market which would provide a natural form of insurance for product failures mane does not carry insurance coverage at a sufficient level to protect against liabilities that arise from our customers activities in the consumer marketplace manes prices are structured to reflect the risk that mane is able to take we would need to charge higher prices if we would be liable on our customers products in the consumer market consider that the liability cap bears no relationship to the insurance coverage that mane carries customers and even members of the mane sales group will sometimes take the position that the cap can be higher because of the level of manes insurance but this is not valid exclusions from liability we should always exclude consequential damages as the very minimum under any applicable law under other laws than french laws we must also exclude indirect punitive incidental and special damages punitive damages probably cannot be excluded by contract under certain us states applicable laws but we usually state this anyway indemnity we try to avoid use of hold harmless parties generally do not intend for this to mean something in addition to indemnify but courts will interpret in some meaning to hold harmless that is separate from indemnify indemnity is granted only as to direct damages we also strive to avoid any commitment to defend or to be responsible for costs or attorneys fees ipr exclusivity intellectual property under no circumstances will mane assign or transfer ipr some parties including mane contract managers confuse this with exclusivity further it should be expressly stated that the ipr in and relating to the products their manufacture development or creation including any improvements specifications formulation and documentation belong to mane a customer may argue for joint development terms so that it can share in the ipr but this is almost never truly the case as mane is the party actually developing the ipr exclusivity generally we avoid exclusivity conditions in supply contracts and would only agree upon specified commercial conditions in a separate agreement if exclusivity has to be granted to be validate by business management several conditions must circumscribe it restricted geographic scope limited duration limited to a specified productreference as identified by product code limited to particular application and either a minimum annual purchase requirement or a reciprocal commitment by the customer to purchase its needs for this flavor fragrance in this application exclusively from mane applicable law and jurisdiction arbitration specify governing law and exclusive jurisdiction for resolution of disputes us 1 ohio hamilton county 2 new york southern district of new york 3 delaware no to california europe 1 france 2 switzerland geneva asia 1 france 2 hong kong 3 singapore exception contracts between ptmi indonesian parties to be governed by the laws of republic of indonesia and must be submitted to bani arbitration governing law and jurisdiction should align in us for instance it is probably not advisable to specify a california court may hear the case but should apply new york laws we try for order shown below we assert that we always seek neutral laws and jurisdiction with our customers if we cannot get our own home laws arguing that the customer should not be privileged with a home court advantage arbitration we generally try to avoid mandatory arbitration main advantage confidentiality main disadvantage expensive especially when we contract with much bigger companies in the us more particularly more expensive may be faster than litigation although it probably just depends but it may be better for mane especially if it is a claim against mane andor is particularly complex to not rush to a decision arbitrator is motivated to extend controversy because payment is higher whereas courts are motivated to move claims off docket riskier because it highly depends on quality and experience of the arbitrator arbitrators are known to split the baby meaning that notwithstanding how speculative a claim might be they will say you each have your points and divide the claim counterparties know this and use mandatory arbitration as a way of enhancing the likelihood of achieving at least some kind of award rules especially in terms of discovery and admission of evidence are more permissive than in standard litigation needs to be organized in the arbitration clause no appeals possible there seems to be greater right for the arbitrator to make a subjective determination rather than being bound by precedent in quite the same way that a court would be product specifications inspection warranty product specifications necessary definition and inspection specifications manes specifications technical data sheets govern if the customer argues we can accept mutually agreedupon specifications in any case customers specifications must be validated and agreed in writing by mane to be applicable time limit for inspection we must always state a time limit for the customers inspection of the products for obvious patent defects we start at 5 days next is 10 days then we might go to 10 working days or 14 days anything longer is too much to accept remedies and warranties for nonconformity claims for defects defects noticeable upon unloading shortages excess or apparently damaged products must be notified to the carrier and mane within 3 days maximum other defects specify a time limit to notify of a claim for defect whether patent or latent after discovery and generally should insist on a maximum of 5 days after discovery there shouldnt be argument on why the customer would require a much longer period to notify mane of a discovered defect manes acknowledgment of nonconformity we cannot accept that the customer unilaterally decides that the products are defective it must be proven defective our preferred approach 1 customer files its claim with mane 2 mane inspects onsite or receives a sample to inspect 3 if mane confirms the claim a remedy is followed but if mane disputes the claim an independent lab agreed upon by the parties makes the determination consequences of nonconformity the customer may not send the products back to mane without manes consent the customer cannot be entitled to cancel the order or charge a fee remedies for nonconformity if mane acknowledges the claim mane will either replace the product or reimburse the amounts paid in respect of the defective nonconforming product this is offered as the sole compensation or sole remedy if the customer insists and strongly objects to this as the sole remedy we can withdraw but we will not accept that the customer expressly reserves the right to invoke rights in addition to one of these remedies warranties mane should only warrant that the products will comply with the specifications the warranty is linked to the time limit for claims but could be made for the shelf life stated by mane if unlimited duration is required this is the maximum that we can accept we will also warrant to compliance with applicable laws and regulations although we should probably avoid further warranting to industry standards these are the sole warranties the warranties do not extend to defects that result from the customers improper storage handling or use including such that does not conform to the specifications andor manes instructions we do not warrant free from defects defects is ambiguous and subjective term we expressly exclude the warranties of merchantability and fitness for the particular purpose if the customer insists on fitness for the purpose we can accept provided it is stated that such specific purpose must have been delivered in writing by the customer we resist as much as we can to warranty against infringement if it becomes a dealbreaker not to warrant that the products do not infringe upon third party ipr then we strive for i to the best of manes knowledge and ii that the warranty applies only to manes products as such or in themselves and ensure we are excluding the possibility of a warranty as to manes product in application ie manes product after customers processing or combination with something else ordering delivery process order mane must confirm an order we usually offer three working days better five for europe for it to be binding upon such acceptance the order is a contract binding upon both parties and may not be cancelled mane should implicitly reserve the right to reject orders but if the customer resists the possibility of mane having the right to turn down orders then we can accept to state that mane may not reject orders except if the order states a quantity that is so substantially large that we cannot produce to that level or upon the leadtime asserted or if the order includes nonagreed terms if the customer strongly insists upon the right to cancel open orders we can sometimes accept but strictly upon the condition that mane has not begun production of the goods under the order forecasts either binding on both or binding on neither mane cannot accept to be contractually bound to produce to forecasts if the customer is not obliged to purchase accordingly better not to mention in the contract any forecast from the customer if the customer has no intention to be bound by it if the parties will have a mutually binding forecast manes supply agreement template provides guidelines on requirements flexibility rules of rolling forecast stock if the customer requires mane to hold stock it should be set up in a separate stock keeping agreement this independent contract will impose obligations on the customer to ensure the stock is purchased delivery mane specifies the delivery leadtime on an exw basis meaning leadtime until we place the products at the disposal of the customer at manes premises not cleared for export and not loaded we prefer selling our products on an fca mane production facility basis as per icc 2010 incoterms meaning delivery occurs when we load the goods on the means of transport provided by the carrier at manes premises we strive to avoid penalties for delays or quantity defects if from the business perspective we cannot reject the principle of such penalties for delayed delivery or quantity defects penalties must be negotiated as follows penalty calculation must be clearly defined in the contract and can only apply to product defects or delayed delivery penalty requirement penalties must only apply to late deliver or product defect never more than 10 the total associated sale value no more than 2 per week delivery is delayed mane requires 30 day right to object penalty must be expressly stated as liquidated damage and exclusive remedy strive to prevent customer right to cancel method of paymentdeduction from future invoices must be spelled out we also strive to avoid time is of the essence because then ontime delivery becomes a material condition and since delays do occur it can be a big risk area any provisions on transport and delivery must align with the agreedupon incoterm also risk of loss is determined by the applicable incoterm transfer of title our starting point is transfer at time of full payment for the goods but if the customer argues we can generally accept title transfer upon delivery financial conditions prices we cannot accept to refer to the order to determine the prices the prices should either be in the supply agreement itself or in a separate offer sent by mane applicable icc 2010 incoterm to be specified preferred fca mane production facility price changes prices are only locked during a validity period stated by mane and after such time mane can update the prices at its discretion during the price validity period mane should reserve the right to update prices in case of a substantial rise in the cost of the raw materials hardship clause in respect of price changes during the validity period we argue that such fluctuations in raw material prices are out of our control and we must avoid being bound to continue to honor contracts at existing prices if becomes prohibitively expensive to sell the products considering that our customers are other businesses they should understand this fundamental economics precept and acknowledge that they would likewise not want to be prevented from passing on additional costs they incur in their own sourcing payment payment terms 30 45 or 60 days from date of invoice anything longer than 60 days is invalid in europe in asia mane might accept a period up to 90 days but should be confirmed first by local management terms run strictly from date of invoice not receipt of invoice or receipt of goods we state no discount is granted for early payment unless management has expressly approved a discount late payments we try to state that mane reserves the right to suspend further delivery of products until all overdue payments are collected we also sometimes state that overdue payments bear interest per applicable laws although if applicable law like french law entitles mane to charge interest then it seems unnecessary to require the mention of this implicit right set off some customers include a clause entitling it to set off amounts that it asserts mane owes to it against payments due to mane generally we reject these clauses if the customer insists then we state that mane must first validate the amount that the customer claims that mane owes to it it should not often be the case that mane owes the customer money anyway mane contracting party the contracting party to a supply agreement among the mane entities must be the invoicing mane company all mane companies are invoicing except as follows asia mane korea is not invoicing emea only the following companies on top of vmf are invoicing as follows only the following products ice cream flavors and mixes former gelcrem products and products manufactured in rubi all other sales in emea are invoiced from vmf miscellaneous legal entity confirm the entity is indeed an active registered entity in a certain jurisdiction it is generally best to state the companys jurisdiction and principal physical address recitals if the contract contains a preamble including whereas clauses it is advisable to avoid placing operative terms in this section as this is generally regarded as the place to set the table for the contract rather than begin establishing binding contractual conditions sometimes terms are defined in the preamble which is usually okay since their use occurs in the operative part of the contract applicable documents check for all references to the applicability of an external document eg supplier expectations code of conduct etc all external documents must be submitted to the contract review procedure including review by legal and in some cases eg specifications should be attached as exhibits to the contract general terms conditions of both parties are excluded purpose it is prudent to state the purpose of the contract which should be to establish the terms and conditions for manes sale and the customers purchase of the goods identified to the contract further we generally should state that the products are intended to be integrated into the customers own products and may not be resold as is provided to a mane competitor or repackaged for distribution to third parties make sure that agreement is a supply contract as some customers attempt to consider mane as a toll manufacturer or service provider confidentiality it is generally advisable to state that the parties will keep technical and commercial information confidential for instance the customer may learn things about manes pricing cost inputs although this is not something the business should be disclosing and administrative information be watchful if we have an existing cda with the customer however as we may need to specifically state that the cda applies particularly so we dont inadvertently supersede the cda by including confidentiality obligations here force majeure mane cannot have liability of any kind in case of true force majeure circumstances we can accept that the customer may terminate the agreement with immediate effect if the force majeure condition persists for more than 90 days it is advisable to state periods of time in either days or years because a month can be more ambiguous does it mean 30 days 31 days 28 days because of four sevenday weeks it could also arguably be interpreted to mean full calendar months must elapse eg if the contract is effective july 10th and specifies some right accrues after 3 months perhaps all of august september and october ie 3 months must pass probably what is meant is the right occurs on october 10th but using 90 days just avoids all that interpretation term it is probably prudent to state a term anywhere from 1 to 5 years depending on the circumstances and managements opinion we can structure to automatically renew or renew only upon mutual agreement in any case the prices if mentioned in the agreement must be valid for the price validity period only termination termination of the supply agreement does not end the customers obligation to fulfill its purchase commitment under outstanding orders we generally seek a thirty day cure period for termination due to default assignment no assignment without consent generally we want to have the ability to negotiate separately with a different party amendment state that amendment is possible only upon mutual written agreement no waiver state that failure to insist upon strict compliance does not constitute a waiver severability state that if a provision is held invalid or unenforceable the other provisions are not affected and only the offending provision is excluded some counterparties instead state that the offending provision is to be construed to most closely approximate the parties intent while taking a legally valid form it is fine as an alternative entire agreement state that the contract constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes previous agreements confirm that this is the case and there arent active agreements that we want to keep but could be impacted by this contract signatures mane prefers wet signatures when feasible however situations will arise where an electronic signature is required due to counterparty demands or practicalities of the situation in these situations a variance from the wet signature requirement may be granted by the assigned legal counsel on a casebycase basis subject to the requirements of this section in order for mane to accept an electronic signature the agreement must be governed by laws that allow for electronic signatures to be binding on the parties the signature itself must be validated to both european union and local requirements this means that the signature must use twofactor authentication or a digital certificate meeting the requirements of the eidas regulation the electronic signature services selected by many mane counterparties do not comply with these requirements in order to facilitate the collection of compliant signatures mane has contracted with docusign to provide a platform for collecting and validating electronic signatures if a contract is approved for electronic signature and the counterparty does not provide a compliant method of signing the contract then the mane contract manager shall request the regional docusign account holder to generate an electronic envelope containing the document the contract manager will supply the person generating the envelope with the name title and email address of the signer in order to meet eu electronic signature requirements the signer will either have to supply their mobile phone number to the mane contact to receive an sms password or obtain a digital certificate at their own expense originals require that the counterparty execute two originals so that each party may receive its own original hard copy if the signatures are not to be electronic we may accept to language that specifies a facsimile or electronic copy qualifies as an original provided we make it clear to the counterparty that we nevertheless require to receive a hard copy original individual signers the parties should have authorized representatives execute beware of duly authorized and make sure it is the case theoretically counterparty might be able to avoid a contract if it can successfully claim that an unauthorized employee entered into a commitment nevertheless it is helpful to keep in mind that we should be looking for individuals with appropriate titles as the signatories when french laws are applicable in case of doubt on the capacity of the signatory to sign the contract in the name and on behalf of the company the following is to be sent in an email to

inventors uf0a7 to record and provide an accounting of the intellectual and technical progress corresponding to each project carried out uf0a7 to explain the manner in which an experiment was carried out and how the results of that experiment was obtained and thus serve as the definitive account of what transpired which thereby ensures the reproducibility of the experiment and uf0a7 to ensure the preservation of information which may be useful for both internal and external communications eg writing scientific publications preparing presentations drafting of patent applications transfer of

to annotate information on an insert eg for reasons of clarity the original preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page note 5 it is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook for example if the data set is too large the writer can also create alternative archives for the data eg an electronic database of hplc chromatographs and simply reference the corresponding file number note 6 rather than the original of an experimental material a photograph or a digitized

november by a member of manes legal and ip department all laboratory notebooks in progress or completed must be submitted to the legal and ip department on the working day immediately preceding the certification date prior to this submission the holder of a laboratory notebook must ensure that the information in each laboratory notebook is correctly recorded including marking out any significant empty space eg marked out with a z updating the table of contents as well as arranging for the proper witnessing of the notebook during certification each laboratory notebook shall be inspected with regard to compliance with this policy at the end of this inspection the reviewer will make an entry into the laboratory notebook and notate the completed inspection by affixing the reviewers stamp date and signature at the end of each certification the notebook will be promptly returned to its assignee ideally no later than the next working day after certification for remote innovation sites without a local or regional representative from manes legal and ip department arrangements will be made based on the volume of laboratory notebooks to enable completion of the certification process without undue expense of time or resources 4 archiving each person assigned to a laboratory notebook is responsible for the maintenance of the notebook while it is in hisher possession the assigned person or holder must ensure that each assigned laboratory book s is stored in a safe and secure location to prevent loss theft or degradation if a laboratory notebook is lost stolen or damaged the assigned person shall immediately notify hisher supervisor the holder and supervisor shall immediately prepare a report detailing the circumstances leading to the loss theft or degradation and the completed report is to be submitted to the legal and ip department for review and investigation prior to preserving an electronic copy of a laboratory notebook the holder must ensure mane laboratory notebook policy mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 9 of 10 that 1 the content of the notebook meets the standards set forth in this policy and 2 the notebook is certified per section 3 above once a notebook is complete and certified the holder should make arrangements with the vp of rd to begin the laboratory notebook scanningarchiving process after securing an electronic archival copy of the laboratory notebook the original hardcopy will be returned to its originally assigned holder for a reasonable period which shall not exceed three 3 years from the date of last entry after the reasonable retention period the original hardcopy of the laboratory notebook will be turned in to the vp of rd or site director who will arrange for long term storage of the notebook within a fire resistant container at the local mane innovation site such as a fire resistant safe utilized by accounting or human resource departments appendix laboratory recordkeeping procedures mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 10 of 10 general instruction laboratory notebooks are the means for keeping a permanent record of the details of an individuals daytoday work in the research and development areas they provide 1 a basic reference which the individual and others can refer to at a later date 2 legal evidence with respect to the materials recorded such as conception of an invention and date thereof or date of reduction to practice and test results and 3 in some instances compliance with the provisions of many contractual arrangements instructions for recording data in the laboratory notebook 1 all entries should be made in a legible and orderly manner using permanent ink preferably black make entries clear and complete that someone else could repeat the experiment 2 avoid erasures if an error is made cross it out and make the correction immediately thereafter cancellations or insertions should be initialed dated and explained by an appropriate notation 3 make sure control page is filled out prior to usage 4 complete the table of contents as you make entries in the notebook 5 state the object and results of each experiment clearly and concisely give a complete factual and self explanatory account of the progress of the work and the procedure followed reference to earlier work done by yourself or another may be accomplished by noting a previous page of the same notebook or the page and number of an earlier notebook describe and give quantities of all materials used explain all code numbers and abbreviations 6 an entry dealing with a conception invention idea must describe the thing conceived example whether it is a chemical compound a combination of a compound and a solvent etc as well as the utility for the ting conceived how it is to be used and the methods by which it is to be prepared including equivalent materials which could be used statements with regard to utility should be stated positively work toward practical implementation of an invention should start as soon as possible in a notebook 7 negative or deprecatory entries should be avoided example a reaction gives a 2 yield was expected do not state process does not work phraseology which expresses an opinion rather than a positive statement and gratuitous comments should be avoided this is not an instruction to omit the conclusion of an experiment which had less than the expected results be factual 8 each days work should whenever possible be started on a separate page with lines drawn down angularly across the unused portion of the previous page this gives legal evidence that additions were not made at a later date it is permissible as stated above to make reference to an earlier page by reciting continued from page it is extremely important that each page show the date of entry 9 each page must be signed and dated by the individual who makes the entry and does the work in addition each page must be witnessed signed and dated using the notation read and understood preferably on the same day but at least within one week the witness should not be connected with the conception should not have taken part in the experimental work performed by another but should understand the technical filed of the entry record laboratory notebook number and project on each page 10 where a conception is made by two or more individuals it need only be entered in the notebook of one but must be signed and dated by all the conceivers ideally all conceivers should sign on the same day 11 for microfilming purposes graphs charts analytical data etc must be attached to the notebook pages with a permanent adhesive and should when unfolded be kept within the confines of the opened notebook no entries should be made on the page beneath attached sheets and nothing must be obscured leave the heading on the top and the space provided for the witnessing signature at the bottom of each page exposed inserts should be signed and dated by the person making the entry and witnessed by another to provide the best legal evidence if materials such as spectra graphs etc are not kept in the notebook they must be signed dated and identified in such a manner as to provide a reference back to the pertinent pages of the laboratory notebook itself 12 report the loss or theft of a research notebook 13 following the use of all the pages of each notebook it must be sent to the library for record maintenance make sure table of contents pages are complete after it has been recorded it will be returned to the individual an individual may retain in his possession the laboratory notebook immediately preceding the one in which entries are currently being made normally all other laboratory notebooks will be kept on file in the library or in vault storage they may then be checked out for reasonable lengths of time by authorized individuals instructions read and includedunderstood by date signature
