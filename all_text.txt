detailed public disclosure of an invention once granted a patent provides from a legal standpoint the right to exclude others from making using selling offering for sale or importing the claimed invention for the term of the patent which is usually 20 years from the filing date subject to the payment of maintenance fees a patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention patents are territorial and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force the granted claims in the specific country are what defines the scope of enforcement patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder permission may typically be granted in the form of a license maintenance fees vary from country to country and when payment is due the basic quid pro quo written description enablement best mode limited monopoly 21 intellectual property basics us confidential

claimed invention pertains 22 intellectual property basics us confidential december 2018 patents 35 usc 101390 claims define the metes and bounds of the patentees exclusive right what defines an invention the claims not the specification provide notice of the scope of patent protection neither the specification which includes the written description of the invention nor the drawings accompanying the specification can be infringed claims must first be construed without reference to an accused product before they can be applied as so construed to the accused product to determine infringement all limitations in a claim must be considered meaningful and cannot be ignored as insignificant or immaterial in determining infringement 23 intellectual property basics us confidential december 2018 trade secrets versus patents patents and trade secrets each have their own inherent advantages and limitations trade secrets patents trade secrets involve no registration costs patents may cost tens of thousands of dollars per jurisdiction trade secrets have immediate effect and may last indefinitely average time to obtain a patent is five years and a patent expires up to 20 years after earliest filing date trade secret protection does not require any formalities such as disclosure of the information to a government authority inventors must disclose the invention to the public without a guarantee of obtaining a patent some trade secrets are susceptible to reverse engineering exclusive rights of patents allows protection from any type of infringement or copying whether intentional or unintentional once the secret is made public anyone may have access to it and use it at will quid pro quo for a limited monopoly to exclude others is public disclosure of the invention a trade secret may be patented by another inventor but prior commercial use defense is available 35 usc 273 independent invention is no defense against patent infringement a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent must show misappropriation patent infringement covers direct and indirect infringement 24 intellectual property basics us confidential december 2018 07 infringement

1 coverage and application 1 the rules and procedures of this understanding shall apply to disputes brought pursuant to the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the agreements listed in appendix 1 to this understanding referred to in this understanding as the covered agreements the rules and procedures of this understanding shall also apply to consultations and the settlement of disputes between members concerning their rights and obligations under the provisions of the agreement establishing the world trade organization referred to in this understanding as the wto agreement and of this understanding taken in isolation or in combination with any other covered agreement 2 the rules and procedures of this understanding shall apply subject to such special or additional rules and procedures on dispute settlement contained in the covered agreements as are identified in appendix 2 to this understanding to the extent that there is a difference between the rules and procedures of this understanding and the special or additional rules and procedures set forth in appendix 2 the special or additional rules and procedures in appendix 2 shall prevail in disputes involving rules and procedures under more than one covered agreement if there is a conflict between special or additional rules and procedures of such agreements under review and where the parties to the dispute cannot agree on rules and procedures within 20 days of the establishment of the panel the chairman of the dispute settlement body provided for in paragraph 1 of article 2 referred to in this understanding as the dsb in consultation with the parties to the dispute shall determine the rules and procedures to be followed within 10 days after a request by either member the chairman shall be guided by the principle that special or additional rules and procedures should be used where possible and the rules and procedures set out in this understanding should be used to the extent necessary to avoid conflict article 2 administration 1 the dispute settlement body is hereby established to administer these rules and procedures and except as otherwise provided in a covered agreement the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements accordingly the dsb shall have the authority to establish panels adopt panel and appellate body reports maintain surveillance of implementation of rulings and recommendations and authorize suspension of concessions and other obligations under the covered agreements with respect to disputes arising under a covered agreement which is a plurilateral trade agreement the term member as used herein shall refer only to those members that are parties to the relevant plurilateral trade agreement where the dsb administers the dispute settlement provisions of a plurilateral trade agreement only those members that are parties to that agreement may participate in decisions or actions taken by the dsb with respect to that dispute 2 the dsb shall inform the relevant wto councils and committees of any developments in disputes related to provisions of the respective covered agreements 80 3 the dsb shall meet as often as necessary to carry out its functions within the timeframes provided in this understanding 4 where the rules and procedures of this understanding provide for the dsb to take a decision it shall do so by consensus15 article 3 general provisions 1 members affirm their adherence to the principles for the management of disputes heretofore applied under articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1947 and the rules and procedures as further elaborated and modified herein 2 the dispute settlement system of the wto is a central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system the members recognize that it serves to preserve the rights and obligations of members under the covered agreements and to clarify the existing provisions of those agreements in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law recommendations and rulings of the dsb cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in the covered agreements 3 the prompt settlement of situations in which a member considers that any benefits accruing to it directly or indirectly under the covered agreements are being impaired by measures taken by another member is essential to the effective functioning of the wto and the maintenance of a proper balance between the rights and obligations of members 4 recommendations or rulings made by the dsb shall be aimed at achieving a satisfactory settlement of the matter in accordance with the rights and obligations under this understanding and under the covered agreements 5 all solutions to matters formally raised under the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements including arbitration awards shall be consistent with those agreements and shall not nullify or impair benefits accruing to any member under those agreements nor impede the attainment of any objective of those agreements 6 mutually agreed solutions to matters formally raised under the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements shall be notified to the dsb and the relevant councils and committees where any member may raise any point relating thereto 7 before bringing a case a member shall exercise its judgement as to whether action under these procedures would be fruitful the aim of the dispute settlement mechanism is to secure a positive solution to a dispute a solution mutually acceptable to the parties to a dispute and consistent with the covered agreements is clearly to be preferred in the absence of a mutually agreed solution the first objective of the dispute settlement mechanism is usually to secure the withdrawal of the measures concerned if these are found to be inconsistent with the provisions of any of the covered agreements the provision of compensation should be resorted to only if the immediate withdrawal of the measure is impracticable and as a temporary measure pending the withdrawal of the measure which is inconsistent with a covered agreement the last resort which this understanding provides to the member invoking the dispute settlement procedures is the possibility of suspending the application of concessions or other obligations under the covered agreements on a discriminatory basis visvis the other member subject to authorization by the dsb of such measures 15 the dsb shall be deemed to have decided by consensus on a matter submitted for its consideration if no member present at the meeting of the dsb when the decision is taken formally objects to the proposed decision 81 8 in cases where there is an infringement of the obligations assumed under a covered agreement the action is considered prima facie to constitute a case of nullification or impairment this means that there is normally a presumption that a breach of the rules has an adverse impact on other members parties to that covered agreement and in such cases it shall be up to the member against whom the complaint has been brought to rebut the charge 9 the provisions of this understanding are without prejudice to the rights of members to seek authoritative interpretation of provisions of a covered agreement through decisionmaking under the wto agreement or a covered agreement which is a plurilateral trade agreement 10 it is understood that requests for conciliation and the use of the dispute settlement procedures should not be intended or considered as contentious acts and that if a dispute arises all members will engage in these procedures in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute it is also understood that complaints and countercomplaints in regard to distinct matters should not be linked 11 this understanding shall be applied only with respect to new requests for consultations under the consultation provisions of the covered agreements made on or after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement with respect to disputes for which the request for consultations was made under gatt 1947 or under any other predecessor agreement to the covered agreements before the date of entry into force of the wto agreement the relevant dispute settlement rules and procedures in effect immediately prior to the date of entry into force of the wto agreement shall continue to apply16 12 notwithstanding paragraph 11 if a complaint based on any of the covered agreements is brought by a developing country member against a developed country member the complaining party shall have the right to invoke as an alternative to the provisions contained in articles 4 5 6 and 12 of this understanding the corresponding provisions of the decision of 5 april 1966 bisd 14s18 except that where the panel considers that the timeframe provided for in paragraph 7 of that decision is insufficient to provide its report and with the agreement of the complaining party that timeframe may be extended to the extent that there is a difference between the rules and procedures of articles 4 5 6 and 12 and the corresponding rules and procedures of the decision the latter shall prevail article 4 consultations 1 members affirm their resolve to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the consultation procedures employed by members 2 each member undertakes to accord sympathetic consideration to and afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding any representations made by another member concerning measures affecting the operation of any covered agreement taken within the territory of the former17 3 if a request for consultations is made pursuant to a covered agreement

receipt of the request or does not enter into consultations within a period of no more than 30 days or a period otherwise 16 this paragraph shall also be applied to disputes on which panel reports have not been adopted or fully implemented 17 where the provisions of any other covered agreement concerning measures taken by regional or local governments or authorities within the territory of a member contain provisions different from the provisions of this paragraph the provisions of such other covered agreement shall prevail 82 mutually agreed after the date of receipt of the request then

councils and committees by the member which requests consultations any request for consultations shall be submitted in writing and shall give the reasons for the request including identification of the measures at issue and an indication of the legal basis for the complaint 5 in the course of consultations in accordance with the provisions of a covered agreement before resorting to further

perishable goods the parties to the dispute panels and the appellate body shall make every effort to accelerate the proceedings to the greatest extent possible 10 during consultations members should give special attention to the particular problems and interests of developing country members 11 whenever a member other than the consulting members considers that it has a substantial trade interest

notify the consulting members and the dsb within 10 days after the date of the circulation of the request for consultations under said article of its desire to be joined in the consultations such

with respect to the same sectors as that in which the panel or appellate body has found a violation or other nullification or impairment b if that party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sectors it may seek to suspend concessions or other obligations in other sectors under the same agreement 93 c if that party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to other sectors under the same agreement and that the circumstances are serious enough it may seek to suspend concessions or other obligations under another covered agreement d in applying the above principles that party shall take into account i the trade in the sector or under the agreement under which the panel or appellate body has found a violation or other nullification or impairment and the importance of such trade to that party ii the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the broader economic consequences of the suspension of concessions or other obligations e if that party decides to request authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations pursuant to subparagraphs b or c it shall state the reasons therefor in its request at the same time as the request is forwarded to the dsb it also shall be forwarded to the relevant councils and also in the case of a request pursuant to subparagraph b the relevant sectoral bodies f for purposes of this paragraph sector means i with respect to goods all goods ii with respect to services a principal sector as identified in the current services sectoral classification list which identifies such sectors28 iii with respect to traderelated intellectual property rights each of the

trade agreements in so far as the relevant parties to the dispute are parties to these agreements ii with respect to services the gats iii with respect to intellectual property rights the agreement on trips 4 the level of the suspension of concessions or other obligations authorized by the dsb shall be equivalent to the level of the nullification or impairment 5 the dsb shall not authorize suspension of concessions or other obligations if a covered agreement prohibits such suspension 6 when the situation described in paragraph 2 occurs the dsb upon request shall grant authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations within 30 days of the expiry of the reasonable period of time unless the dsb decides by consensus to reject the request however if the member concerned objects to the level of suspension proposed or claims that the principles and procedures set forth in paragraph 3 have not been followed where a complaining party has requested 28 the list in document mtngnsw120 identifies eleven sectors 94 authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations pursuant to paragraph 3b or c the matter shall be referred to arbitration such arbitration shall be carried out by the original panel if members are available or by an arbitrator29 appointed by the directorgeneral and shall be completed within 60 days after the date of expiry of the reasonable period of time concessions or other obligations shall not be suspended during the course of the arbitration 7 the arbitrator30 acting pursuant to paragraph 6 shall not examine the nature of the concessions or other obligations to be suspended but shall determine whether the level of such suspension is equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment the arbitrator may also determine if the proposed suspension of concessions or other obligations is allowed under the covered agreement however if the matter referred to arbitration includes a claim that the principles and procedures set forth in paragraph 3 have not been followed the arbitrator shall examine that claim in the event the arbitrator determines that those principles and procedures have not been followed the complaining party shall apply them consistent with paragraph 3 the parties shall accept the arbitrators decision as final and the parties concerned shall not seek a second arbitration the dsb shall be informed promptly of the decision of the arbitrator and shall upon request grant authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations where the request is consistent with the decision of the arbitrator unless the dsb decides by consensus to reject the request 8 the suspension of concessions or other obligations shall be temporary and shall only be applied until such time as the measure found to be inconsistent with a covered agreement has been removed or the member that must implement recommendations or rulings provides a solution to the nullification or impairment of benefits or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached in accordance with paragraph 6 of article 21 the dsb shall continue to keep under surveillance the implementation of adopted recommendations or rulings including those cases where compensation has been provided or concessions or other obligations have been suspended but the recommendations to bring a measure into conformity with the covered agreements have not been implemented 9 the dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements may be invoked in respect of measures affecting their observance taken by regional or local governments or authorities within

agreements playbook guidelines are intended to cover the review of contracts proposed by counterparties and the review of amendments to manes agreement proposals that are made by counterparties manes organization and reference numbers we must ensure that mane confidentiality policy and its faq are strictly complied with in the us administration of cdas is centralized which includes registration by peggi ridner sales assistant at minc back up peggie schenke by stacy stoll at musa back up debbie pannuto for kancor mita is taking care of it until kancor employees are provided access rights to sharepoint for the rest of the group the mane contract manager mane employee requesting the cda issuance or review is responsible for administrating and we do not do it confirm the mane contract manager has properly designated the cda as one of the four types identified below bi bilateral for the protection of both parties u unilateral for manes protection only ud unilateral formula disclosure this form is required when mane will disclose formulae oth unilateral for the counterpartys protection only confirm the mane contract manager registered the cda and added the reference id to the footer reviews of cda proposals to mane for negotiation purposes in bold essential in grey not essential identify the parties to the contract using full legal registered names jurisdiction and address are useful but not essential need to check which mane entity isare involved in the disclosure and receipt of confidential information define the subject matter or purpose correspond with the mane contract manager if it is unclear and the mane contract manager did not properly define it in the register entry broader language gives the parties more flexibility and avoids the possibility of the parties disclosing ci that would not be covered under narrower subject matter narrower language provides more control over the ci flow and avoids ambiguity about the scope of the cda as a rule subject matter purpose must be specified and detailed as much as possible with customers or prospects make sure it is connected to business with mane supply of products by mane ie that mane ci cannot be used by counterparty for another purpose than within the framework of business relationship with mane specify an effective date or state that the cda becomes effective on the date of last signature define confidential information if mane is disclosing bi u ud it should include formulae specifications manufacturing process data sample materials knowhow and documentation and business information legitimately regarded as proprietary define the discloser or disclosing party to apply to both mane and the counterparty bi if it is not the case in the counterparty proposal and if mane contract manager confirms mane has ci to cover if mane contract manager declares in writing that mane has no ci to cover and will not disclose ci under the cda the cda will remain an oth and it will need to be reminded in writing internally that no ci can be disclosed under the cda specify that ci does not need to be identified as confidential or refuse such a statement if mentioned bi u ud we try to avoid requiring that our ci be designated to qualify for protection but we can accept if the counterparty requires it in such case we must alert the mane contract manager to this requirement note if mane turns over ci but fails to designate it as confidential despite the cda requiring it then the ci is not protected under the cda or any document accordingly mane will have disclosed ci without using reasonable means to ensure it is kept secret a fundamental precept of us trade secret law so even if the counterparty still treats the ci as confidential mane has arguably lost the right to claim protection of it including as to third parties because we will have put the ci in the hands of another party without protections in place if mane wants the right to share the counterparties ci with mane affiliates then add such right and define affiliates by using the definition in manes standard forms bi oth control must exceed 50 refuse sharing of ci with agents consultants advisors or representatives in the majority of cases the counterparty reserves the right to share with these external third parties we strike arguing that 1 the counterparty doesnt really need to share manes ci with them 2 mane loses visibility on who has its ci and 3 mane effectively loses control over the ci because we lack privity of contract with the third party in some cases mane can accept to extend the right to sharing with external consultants although we should require an explanation as to precisely why it is needed but we would require to add 1 that the counterparty first submit the names of the consultant and obtain manes approval 2 that the counterparty remains fully obligated toward mane for any failure of the consultant to observe the restrictions alternatively mane might require to sign a separate cda with the consultant observe the different forms that agents can be engaged 1 counterpartys agents permitted to share counterpartys ci directly with mane 2 counterparty reserves right to share ci of agents or even third parties or 3 counterparty reserves right to share mane ci with counterpartys agents these three are listed roughly in increasing order of risk to mane for situation 1 we try to avoid and can usually accept if the counterparty pushes although we then require that the agent designate the ci as confidential and property of counterparty in order for it to qualify for protection under the cda we also specify that the counterparty remains liable for its agents actions or omissions that violate the cda for situation 2 it seems it should not usually be valid for the counterparty to claim a need to share third party ci consider especially that if the third party acted responsibly in relation to its ci it established confidentiality commitments with manes counterparty and the counterparty might be violating such obligations by sharing with mane a situation we dont want to be embroiled in for situation 3 the comments above apply we generally reject the counterpartys right to share mane ci outside the company but may be able to accept upon restrictive conditions specify the confidentiality obligations hold in confidence restrict access to employees and affiliates who need to know for the purpose of the subject matter prevent disclosure to third parties use ci only for the purpose of the subject matter use same standard of care as used for own ci but no less than reasonable standard no copying or reproducing ci except as necessary to effectuate the purpose of the subject matter include a nonanalysis clause proscribing reverse engineering of manes samples by the counterparty or any other party at the counterpartys direction we should always insist on this in rare cases counterparties have refused and then we can probably withdraw provided the mane team is given very strict instructions that they may not provide sample materials some counterparties require a separate material transfer agreement to protect sample materials mane is content with our standard cda although we do have an mta form if the counterparty will reject the full cda assuming the counterparty will only be receiving samples and no other forms of ci specify the obligations survive either termination or expiration of the cda many counterparties refuse indefinite survival of obligations manes response depends on the particular circumstances we can argue for survival because the obligations are negative ie neither party has a continuing obligation to do anything rather they must only not misappropriate or further disclose ci considering that in practice parties usually do not formally return or destroy ci belonging to the other party we want to avoid anyone else having possession of mane ci with restrictions expiring at the conclusion of some arbitrary survival period we can argue further that if we grant them the exception ie the obligations will expire after a defined survival period then mane loses confidentiality protection on any ci still in the counterpartys possession not just as to the counterparty but as to the world on the theory that we cannot effectively oblige someone else to treat our information as confidential if we have tacitly allowed a third party to have it without restriction this being said since indefinite obligations might also be terminated which could lead to mane being less protected than with a limited survival of obligations we can accept to limit the survival if we withdraw from the indefinite survival position we try for a longer period of perhaps 10 or 20 years depending on the sensitivity of the ci to be disclosed for cda ud we should not accept less than 20 years this issue in particular underscores the value of discretion ie manes employees should not treat a cda as an opportunity to freely discuss and share anything and everything rather mane should still be thoughtful about disclosing only what is really necessary to further a discussion or relationship define the exceptions to ci obligations ci is already in the receiving partys unrestricted possession ie without obligations we can accept if the counterparty includes as proven by documentary evidence ci is publicly available ci later becomes publicly available ci is received on nonconfidential basis by third party who has bona fide right to disclose we can accept if the counterparty includes as proven by documentary evidence ci is independently developed by the party its employees agents or representatives who have not used or relied upon the ci we can accept if the counterparty includes as proven by documentary evidence some counterparties specify who have not had access to the ci mane has used this in its own forms in the past it is acceptable but i think better to avoid because usually mane is the party performing the rd and this could theoretically restrict manes work insofar as the same individual that independently develops certain ci may also be the same person that has had access to or come into contact with the ci of the counterparty of course the aim is not to try to misappropriate anyone elses work but this exception clause does not permit that anyway ci that is required to be disclosed by judicial order requirement of governmental agency or by operation of law in respect of this compulsory disclosure exception be mindful that if the counterparty frames these exceptions as outside the definition of confidential information rather than exceptions to the confidentiality obligations a correction should be made either by specifying the exceptions apply to the obligations or by setting off this particular exception it is a subtle point and important to recognize that simply because a court or agency requires that the counterparty turn over certain mane ci it does not convert mane ci to nonconfidential rather the counterparty is simply excused from the confidentiality obligations to allow it to comply with the order state that ci remains the disclosers property state that no license or other ip right is granted or implied refuse any direct or indirect reference to an assignment of manes ip rights this includes statements that information derived from ci must be considered as confidential make sure the ci is the information disclosed by a party to the other party nothing else require return or destruction of ci upon written request we try to avoid having this obligation occur automatically upon an event eg end of need for ci expiration termination because that would require that mane track this requirement and we dont have the systems to control for this so if we fail to observe the commitment then mane would be in breach better to require that the owner make a written request it remains entirely within their discretion to receive the ci back and protects us from violating the cda inadvertently we generally want to avoid retention of a copy of ci but we can likely accept provided it is specified that the copy may be kept only by legal counsel strictly for the purpose of determining continuing obligations ie if mane would accuse a counterparty of misappropriating its ci the counterparty wants to ensure it actually has a copy of the source ci that is the subject of the controversy in order to be able to properly defend itself the following shall be added in case the counterparty insists return and destruction of ci all proprietary information shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be destroyed andor returned by the receiving party to the disclosing party upon written request of the disclosing party and the same shall be confirmed by the receiving party in writing to the disclosing party state that no assignment of the cda is permitted without the consent of the other party state that the cda does not imply any promise to transact business state that disclosure is at the discretion of the disclosing party state that failure to insist upon strict compliance does not constitute a waiver state that no amendment is permitted without mutual written agreement state that if a provision is held invalid or unenforceable the other provisions are not affected and only the offending provision is excluded some counterparties instead state that the offending provision is to be construed to most closely approximate the parties intent while taking a legally valid form this seems fine as an alternative state that the cda constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes previous agreements if not already known it is useful to check the register to confirm there arent any prior cdas in some cases we may need to state that the new cda does not affect a certain cda that is meant to continue specify governing law and exclusive jurisdiction for resolution of disputes us 1 ohio hamilton county 2 new york southern district of new york 3 delaware no to california europe 1 france 2 switzerland geneva asia 1 france 2 hong kong 3 singapore generally we try to avoid mandatory arbitration specify the term often three years from effective date but if no term will be stated then it is probably prudent to assert the respective parties right to terminate the agreement upon 30 or 60 days written notice identify the representatives and their titles for notices and correspondence we dont always insist upon adding this but it can be useful the register nevertheless requires that an individual be nominated require that the counterparty execute two originals so that each party may receive its own original hard copy avoid language that specifies a facsimile or electronic copy qualifies as an original provided we make it clear to the counterparty that we nevertheless require to receive a hard copy original the parties should have authorized representatives execute theoretically a counterparty might be able to avoid a contract if it can successfully claim that an unauthorized employee entered into a commitment nevertheless it is helpful to keep in mind that we should be looking for individuals with appropriate titles as the signatories when french laws are applicable in case of doubt on the capacity of the signatory to sign the contract in the name and on behalf of the company the following is to be sent in an email to the counterparty by mane contract manager thank you for confirming that mrmrs in hisher quality of is entitled to sign the contract for and on behalf of the companybefore the refuse joint and codevelopment language in cdas if the counterparty objects argue it is beyond the scope of the cda also it is generally not the case and usually not to manes advantage refuse any mention of exclusivity exclusivity in supply is entirely outside the scope of the cda mane formulas disclosures if mane will be disclosing formulaes it should only be for a toxicological safety or regulatory compliance purpose and manes ud template must be used the individuals to be limited in number and usually restricted to the regulatory and quality departments at the counterparty who will have access to manes formulae must sign the cda personally arguments for personal commitments of counterpartys employees it is manes global corporate policy and has been in place for many years 2009 it is required if mane is obliged to share formulae for flavors mane is a member of iofi and adheres to its code of practice 632 specifies that iofi members should require personal commitments formulae are among manes most sensitive ci so it is necessary to use very strict controls to guard against possible misappropriation which would not simply dilute the value but end it mane invests considerable resources in rd so our counterparties need to respect the measures we must take to protect manes developments the counterpartys internal confidentiality policies and the deontology of regulatory ips do not provide any remedy to mane against breach of the secrecy of formulae the responsibility of the counterpartys employees does not change they would be obliged to observe the confidentiality obligations regardless of their signature the personal commitment simply allows mane to have a recourse directly against the particular individual the personal commitment is especially important because it protects mane when the individual changes employers also if the individual is instructed by his employer our counterparty to act in a way that would violate the cda he or she would be personally accountable toward mane for such breach we do not accept if the counterparty invokes labor law to refuse personal commitments it is without merit regarding manes need to be protected directly manes own employees are sometimes required to commit personally transparency some major market players relies on the transparency trend initiated notably by consumers to ask for full formula disclosure without any limitation to toxicological safety and regulatory compliance evaluation purposes since their aim is to disclose some information about the formula to the final consumer our cda templates were not adequate therefore we have introduced a new cda template for transparency matters tr which covers the disclosure of the qualitative formula quantities are not disclosed such template is only available to legal ip department and might only be used for major perfumery clients and as an exception with the prior approval of the region director ie mmm for americas sma for emea bjl for asia using such tr template is imperative for any transparency requests from a customer proposed clause for material transfer agreement when mane is providing samples and the counterpart requires the sample to be blend in its product to test the product performance the following to be added xxx shall not itself or through a third party reverse engineer or reproduce proprietary material in order to determine the chemical structure composition or manufacturing process without the prior written consent of mane xxx can only use the samples for testing its

for a specific market fragrance flavour for the food cosmetic personal care home care and less frequently in fine fragrance pharmaceutical tobacco pet food and oral care industries and grow manes direct sales accordingly a mane distributor is appointed to resell as is some of manes products fragrances flavours ingredients within a limited territory country region city for a specific market fragrance flavour for the food cosmetic personal care home care and less frequently in fine fragrance pharmaceutical tobacco pet food and oral care industries to its own customers what is the difference between a commercial representative and an agent an agent is entitled to negotiate selling prices on behalf of the company it represents while a commercial representative is not mane does not appoint agents only commercial representatives does commercial representative or distributor have to meet any sales target yes necessarily if it is appointed on an exclusive basis can we pay a commission to a distributor no a distributor makes profit out of its own sales as opposed to a commercial representative which receives a commissionbased compensation from mane for its services what does it mean granting exclusivity to a distributor or a commercial representative it prevents mane from appointing any other distributor or commercial representative of the products in the territory in the market can mane determine the selling price of mane products from a distributor no distributor must remain free to establish its prices and discounts for the products and related services with the goal of maximizing the competitiveness of the products and preserving the reputation of mane at mane request the distributor will inform mane about these prices and discounts and any planned change thereof can we conclude a single agreement covering both flavour and fragrance segment for the same commercial representative or distributor it is always advisable to have two agreements for two different segments flavour and fragrance for the same commercial representative or distributor this gives the advantage of termination rights to mane if commercial representative or the distributor is unable to meet the sales target for flavour but achieve the target for fragrance then mane can terminate the flavour agreement only and retain the fragrance agreement why do we need to exclude certain customers from the scope of commercial representation or distribution agreement the customers excluded from the scope of a commercial representation or distribution agreement are mane reserved customers who pursue their existing business relationships directly with mane without compensation for a commercial representative and cannot be considered distributors own customers the list of such excludedreserved customers should be reviewedupdated by mane and the commercial representative or distributor at the end of each calendar year and modified as the case maybe through an amendment to the agreement can a commercial representative distributor use manes trademark commercial representative cannot use mane trademark without manes prior written approval distributor has no rights connected with mane trademark other than those which are strictly necessary to the marketing and sale of the products can a commercial representative distributor further subcontract no

contract reviewxa0process the contract review process provides for the conditions of verification and modifications of agreement proposals concerning the mane group the purpose of this process is to make sure mane actually wants and can comply with the terms and conditions offeredsubmitted to it and that such terms and conditions are compliant with manes policies and operating methods the legal ip department proceeds with the final review of the concerned document based on the feedbacks of each concerned department at mane what kinds of documents are concerned all draft agreements or commercial terms sent by our customers suppliers trading partners other than a mere order that intend to bind mane to comply with conditions or requirements examples include supply agreements purchase agreements products or services development agreements research agreements partnerships etc as soon as i two mane internal departments or more are concerned and ii the document must be signed by mane it shall be subject to the contract review process only manes legal ip department is permitted to draft agreements any draft agreement written by a mane collaborator outside the legal ip department cannot receive the proper contract review process without exception any and all contract needs shall be submitted to the legal ip department specifying the details background and if needed the whys and wherefores of the project by using the standard forms accessible here through this link if applicable what kinds of documents are not concerned the contract review process does not apply to confidentiality agreements cf manes confidentiality policy product specification files quality files delivery terms and conditions and to commercial contracts from nestl group any clients general terms and conditions of purchase shall not be discussed and therefore not be subject to the contract review process since we systematically reply that manes sales are subject to its general terms and conditions of sales who oversees the follow up of the contract review process and what is hisher role the legal ip department is not in charge of the follow up of this process it is the contract administration coordinator who is the person in charge of the relationship with the partner or the customersupplier this coordinator is responsible for the supervision centralization and coordination of the contract review process as described more precisely in question 5 from its receipt to its possible signature by mane what are the steps to follow first the contract administration coordinator must carefully read the agreement in its entirety in order to identify every element not i compliant with manes practices or reality or ii acceptable from an operational standpoint consequently the contract administration coordinator will identify the terms of the contract to be validated by the appropriate department after this examination the coordinator shall fill in the xa0form for commercial contract review and identify in such form the collaborators from the different mane departments one collaborator per department must validate or modify some parts of the draft agreement the coordinator will email the contract to be reviewed in an editable version in french english or spanish the completed in form and if any the documents targeted in the agreement to every person that shall review the contract one maximum per department as identified in the form the coordinator will specify in his email a deadline for the receipt of the comments by the operational staff so that the legal ip department will have reasonable time to review and if necessary modify the agreement once all comments are receivedt the coordinator follows up regularly the feedbacks received and if necessary sends a reminder to those who failed to send their feedbacks the coordinator centralizes the feedbacks and sends the comments and consolidated decisions to the legal ip department for a final review of the document the legal ip department sends a modified version of the agreement to the coordinator who will send it back to the counterparty the coordinator negotiates with the counterparty being reminded that certain terms are solely to the legal ip departments discretion and not left to acceptance by operational staff the legal ip department cannot contact or be silently present on a call the counterpartys commercial staff without the counterpartys legal department being present the legal ip department will not act as the point of contact for mane it is solely the responsibility of the coordinator if the modifications of the agreement requested by mane are not all accepted the points of disagreements shall be reviewed following the same process validation by the operational staff followed by the legal ip departments final review the coordinator is in charge of the signature process of the final agreement as accepted by mane and the counterparty mane prefers original wet ink signatures when feasible however situations will arise where an electronic signature is required due to counterpartys demands or practicalities of the situation in these situations a duly certified electronic signature may be arranged on a casebycase basis once the agreement duly initialed and signed by the parties is received by the coordinator he must scan it and keep a digital copy send it to all the mane departments concerned by the agreement and to the legal ip department the legal counsel in charge of the review send one hard copy of the signed agreement to the legal ip department and the other hard copy or others in case of plural parties to the counterparty being reminded that it is necessary to have as many original hard copies as there are parties to the agreements when should i involve the legal ip department the legal ip department the legal counsel previously involved in similar contracts with the same counterparty must be copied on the correspondence regarding the contract review between all the involved departments but the contract will only be submitted to the legal ip department once all the required validations and comments are obtained how should communication be handled between the counterparty and the legal ip department when the legal ip department provides communication emailscommentsadvice andor feedback to manes collaborators these communications are highly confidential and such collaborators should not share them as is with the counterparty the legal ip department should not be copied on the emails to the counterparty and the email address of the legal counsel in charge of the review should not be communicated to the counterparty for other purposes than direct contact with the counterpartys legal department and subject to the legal counsels prior approval what is the role of the legal ip department in the contract review process the legal ip department only reviews the contract once the coordinator addresses it with all the comments and revisions gathered and will modify the agreement in compliance with the policies and operating methods of mane who is entitled to sign the contract once reviewed and validated by all concerned departments and by the partner the agreement shall be signed for mane by a member of manes board of administration or by a director who is entitled to

date of filing a patent application absolute novelty an invention shall be considered as novel if it does not form part of the state of the art to this end it is thus necessary to have a complete and

a whole is not found in one and unique disclosure clearly and explicitly thus said invention is novel in order to be novelty destroying a prior art disclosure must be complete meaning that all the elements of an invention must be found completely in said prior art disclosure sufficient meaning that said disclosure should allow the man skilled in the art reproducing the invention certain and

inventiveness of an invention 12 the purpose of the inventiveness or obviousness requirement is to be sure that with respect to the prior art an invention would not be obvious for a person skilled in the art the final purpose of this requirement is to prevent rewarding a third party with an exclusive right a patent for a straightforward modification of the existing prior art any novel invention must be inventive ie it must bring a solution to a technical problem not be obvious for the man skilled in the art for any invention and thus for any technical domain there is a specific man or person

assessing the inventiveness of an invention each technical effects as provided previously by the inventors is evaluated in view of the closest prior art document a specific approach which is different depending on the country is followed for example in europe the approach is called problemsolution approach and consists mainly in identifying the closest prior art determining the objective technical problem to be solved by the invention and examining whether or not the claimed solution to said objective technical problem is obvious for the person skilled in the art if the person skilled in the art would have been prompted to modify the closest prior art in such a way as to arrive at something falling within the terms of the claims then the invention does not involve an inventive step

assessing the novelty inventiveness and utility of an invention it is possible to conclude that the invention is novel and inventive in this case a patent application can be filed before or after having reviewed our freedom to operate and could be considered a priori as strong the invention is novel but not inventive in this case the advice is not to patent indeed the inventive step or obviousness bar is quite high in europe in the us or in japan and the risk is to disclose our innovation for nothing mane patents strategy is to file only strong a priori patent applications for

european parliament and of the council of 16 february 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions recast text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 114 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 whereas 1 a number of substantive changes are to be made to directive 200035ec of the european parliament and of the council of 29 june 2000 on combating late payment in commercial transactions 3 it is desirable for reasons of clarity and rationalisation that the provisions in question be recast 2 most goods and services are supplied within the internal market by economic operators to other economic operators and to public authorities on a deferred payment basis whereby the supplier gives its client time to pay the invoice as agreed between parties as set out in the suppliers invoice or as laid down by law 3 many payments in commercial transactions between economic operators or between economic operators and public authorities are made later than agreed in the contract or laid down in the general commercial conditions although the goods are delivered or the services performed many corresponding invoices are paid well after the deadline such late payment negatively affects liquidity and complicates the financial management of undertakings it also affects their competitiveness and profitability when the creditor needs to obtain external financing because of late payment the risk of such negative effects strongly increases in periods of economic downturn when access to financing is more difficult 4 judicial claims related to late payment are already facilitated by council regulation ec no 442001 of 22 december 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 4 regulation ec no 8052004 of the european parliament and of the council of 21 april 2004 creating a european enforcement order for unconxad tested claims 5 regulation ec no 18962006 of the european parliament and of the council of 12 december 2006 creating a european order for payment procedure 6 and regulation ec no 8612007 of the european parliament and of the council of 11 july 2007 establishing a european small claims procedure 7 however in order to discourage late payment in commercial transactions it is necessary to lay down complementary provisions 5 undertakings should be able to trade throughout the internal market under conditions which ensure that transborder operations do not entail greater risks than domestic sales distortions of competition would ensue if substantially different rules applied to domestic and transborder operations en 2322011 official journal of the european union l 481 1 oj c 255 2292010

and mediumsized enterprises smes access to finance should be facilitated and that a legal and business environment supportive of timely payments in commercial transactions should be developed it should be noted that public authorities have a special responsibility in this regard the criteria for the definition of smes are set out in commission recommendation 2003361ec of 6 may 2003 concerning the definition of micro small and medium sized enterprises 1 7 one of the priority actions of the commission communication of 26 november 2008 entitled european economic recovery plan is the reduction of administrative burdens and the promotion of entreprexad neurship by inter alia ensuring that as a matter of principle invoices including to smes for supplies and services are paid within 1 month to ease liquidity constraints 8 the scope of this directive should be limited to payments made as remuneration for commercial transxad actions this directive should not regulate transactions with consumers interest in connection with other payments for instance payments under the laws on cheques and bills of exchange or payments made as compensation for damages including payments from insurance companies furthermore member states should be able to exclude debts that are subject to insolvency proceedings including proceedings aimed at debt restructuring 9 this directive should regulate all commercial transactions irrespective of whether they are carried out between private or public undertakings or between undertakings and public authorities given that public authorities handle a considerable volume of payments to underxad takings it should therefore also regulate all commercial transactions between main contractors and their suppliers and subcontractors 10 the fact that the liberal professions are covered by this directive should not oblige member states to treat them as undertakings or merchants for purposes outside the scope of this directive 11 the delivery of goods and the provision of services for remuneration to which this directive applies should also include the design and execution of public works and building and civil engineering works 12 late payment constitutes a breach of contract which has been made financially attractive to debtors in most member states by low or no interest rates charged on late payments andor slow procedures for redress a decisive shift to a culture of prompt payment including one in which the exclusion of the right to charge interest should always be considered to be a grossly unfair contractual term or practice is necessary to reverse this trend and to discourage late payment such a shift should also include the introduction of specific provisions on payment periods and on the compensation of creditors for the costs incurred and inter alia that the exclusion of the right to compensation for recovery costs should be presumed to be grossly unfair 13 accordingly provision should be made for businessto business contractual payment periods to be limited as a general rule to 60 calendar days however there may be circumstances in which undertakings require more extensive payment periods for example when underxad takings wish to grant trade credit to their customers it should therefore remain possible for the parties to expressly agree on payment periods longer than 60 calendar days provided however that such extension is not grossly unfair to the creditor 14 in the interest of consistency of union legislation the definition of contracting authorities in directive 200417ec of the european parliament and of the council of 31 march 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water energy transport and postal services sectors 2 and in directive 200418ec of the european parliament and of the council of 31 march 2004 on the coorxad dination of procedures for the award of public works contracts public supply contracts and public services contracts 3 should apply for the purposes of this directive 15 statutory interest due for late payment should be calculated on a daily basis as simple interest in accordance with regulation eec euratom no 118271 of the council of 3 june 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods dates and time limits 4 16 this directive should not oblige a creditor to claim interest for late payment in the event of late payment this directive should allow a creditor to resort to charging interest for late payment without giving any prior notice of nonperformance or other similar notice reminding the debtor of his obligation to pay 17 a debtors payment should be regarded as late for the purposes of entitlement to interest for late payment where the creditor does not have the sum owed at his disposal on the due date provided that he has fulfilled his legal and contractual obligations en l 482 official journal of the european union 2322011 1 oj l 124 2052003 p 36 2 oj l 134 3042004 p 1 3

determining payment deadlines for the purposes of this directive member states should promote systems that give legal certainty as regards the exact date of receipt of invoices by the debtors including in the field of einvoicing where the receipt of invoices could generate electronic evidence and which is partly governed by the provisions on invoicing contained in council directive 2006112ec of 28 november 2006 on the common system of value added tax 1 19 fair compensation of creditors for the recovery costs incurred due to late payment is necessary to discourage late payment recovery costs should also include the recovery of administrative costs and compensation for internal costs incurred due to late payment for which this directive should determine a fixed minimum sum which may be cumulated with interest for late payment compensation in the form of a fixed sum should aim at limiting the administrative and internal costs linked to the recovery compensation for the recovery costs should be determined without prejudice to national provisions according to which a national court may award compensation to the creditor for any additional damage regarding the debtors late payment 20 in addition to an entitlement to payment of a fixed sum to cover internal recovery costs creditors should also be entitled to reimbursement of the other recovery costs they incur as a result of late payment by a debtor such costs should include in particular those incurred by creditors in instructing a lawyer or employing a debt collection agency 21 this directive should be without prejudice to the right of member states to provide for fixed sums for compenxad sation of recovery costs which are higher and therefore more favourable to the creditor or to increase those sums inter alia in order to keep pace with inflation 22 this directive should not prevent payments by instalments or staggered payments however each instalment or payment should be paid on the agreed terms and should be subject to the rules for late payment set out in this directive 23 as a general rule public authorities benefit from more secure predictable and continuous revenue streams than undertakings in addition many public authorities can obtain financing at more attractive conditions than undertakings at the same time public authorities depend less than undertakings on building stable commercial relationships for the achievement of their aims long payment periods and late payment by public authorities for goods and services lead to unjusxad tified costs for undertakings it is therefore appropriate to introduce specific rules as regards commercial transxad actions for the supply of goods or services by underxad takings to public authorities which should provide in particular for payment periods normally not exceeding 30 calendar days unless otherwise expressly agreed in the contract and provided it is objectively justified in the light of the particular nature or features of the contract and in any event not exceeding 60 calendar days 24 however account should be taken of the specific situation of public authorities carrying out economic activities of an industrial or commercial nature by offering goods or services on the market as a public undertaking for that purpose member states should be allowed under certain conditions to extend the statutory payment period up to a maximum of 60 calendar days 25 a particular cause for concern in connection with late payment is the situation of health services in a large number of member states healthcare systems as a fundamental part of europes social infrastructure are often obliged to reconcile individual needs with the available finances as the population of europe ages as expectations rise and as medicine advances all systems have to deal with the challenge of prioritising healthcare in a way that balances the needs of individual patients with the financial resources available member states should therefore be able to grant public entities providing healthcare a certain amount of flexibility in meeting their commitments for that purpose member states should be allowed under certain conditions to extend the statutory payment period up to a maximum of 60 calendar days member states should nonetheless make every effort to ensure that payments in the healthcare sector are made within the statutory payment periods 26 in order not to jeopardise the achievement of the objective of this directive member states should ensure that in commercial transactions the maximum duration of a procedure of acceptance or verification does not exceed as a general rule 30 calendar days nevertheless it should be possible for a verification procedure to exceed 30 calendar days for example in the case of particularly complex contracts when expressly agreed in the contract and in any tender documents and if it is not grossly unfair to the creditor 27 the union institutions are in a situation comparable to that of the public authorities of member states with regard to their financing and commercial relationships council regulation ec euratom no 16052002 of 25 june 2002 on the financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the european communities 2 specifies that the validation authorisation and payment of expenditure by union institutions must be completed en 2322011 official journal of the european union l 483 1 oj l 347 11122006 p 1 2 oj l 248 1692002 p 1 within the time limits laid down in its implementing rules those implementing rules are currently set out in

to the general budget of the european communities 1 and specify the circumstances in which creditors which are paid late are entitled to receive default interest in the context of the ongoing review of those regulations it should be ensured that the maximum time limits for payment by the union institutions are aligned with statutory periods applicable to public authorities in accordance with this directive 28 this directive should prohibit abuse of freedom of contract to the disadvantage of the creditor as a result where a term in a contract or a practice relating to the date or period for payment the rate of interest for late payment or the compensation for recovery costs is not justified on the grounds of the terms granted to the debtor or it mainly serves the purpose of procuring the debtor additional liquidity at the expense of the creditor it may be regarded as constituting such an abuse for that purpose and in accordance with the academic draft common frame of reference any contractual term or practice which grossly deviates from good commercial practice and is contrary to good faith and fair dealing should be regarded as unfair to the creditor in particular the outright exclusion of the right to charge interest should always be considered as grossly unfair whereas the exclusion of the right to compensation for recovery costs should be presumed to be grossly unfair this directive should not affect national provisions relating to the way contracts are concluded or regulating the validity of contractual terms which are unfair to the debtor 29 in the context of enhanced efforts to prevent the abuse of freedom of contract to the detriment of creditors organisations officially recognised as representing underxad takings and organisations with a legitimate interest in representing undertakings should be able to take action before national courts or administrative bodies in order to prevent the continued use of contract terms or practices which are grossly unfair to the creditor 30 in order to contribute to the achievement of the objective of this directive member states should foster the spread of good practices including by encouraging the publixad cation of a list of prompt payers 31 it is desirable to ensure that creditors are in a position to exercise a retention of title clause on a nondiscrimixad natory basis throughout the union if the retention of title clause is valid under the applicable national provisions designated by private international law 32 this directive only defines the term enforceable title but should not regulate the various procedures for forced execution of such a title or the conditions under which forced execution of such a title can be stopped or suspended 33 the consequences of late payment can be dissuasive only if they are accompanied by procedures for redress which are rapid and effective for the creditor in accordance with the principle of nondiscrimination set out in article 18 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union those procedures should be available to all creditors who are established in the union 34 in order to facilitate compliance with the provisions of this directive member states should encourage recourse to mediation or other means of alternative dispute resolution directive 200852ec of the european parliament and of the council of 21 may 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters 2 already sets a framework for systems of mediation at union level especially for crossborder disputes without preventing its application to internal mediation systems member states should also encourage interested parties to draw up voluntary codes of conduct aimed in particular at contributing to the implementation of this directive 35 it is necessary to ensure that the recovery procedures for unchallenged claims related to late payment in commercial transactions be completed within a short period of time including through an expedited procedure and irrespective of the amount of the debt 36 since the objective of this directive namely combating late payment in the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore by reason of its scale and effect be better achieved at the union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 37 the obligation to transpose this directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with directive 200035ec the obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under that directive 38 this directive should be without prejudice to the oblixad gations of the member states relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and application of directive 200035ec en l 484 official journal of the european union 2322011 1 oj l 357 31122002 p 1 2 oj l 136 2452008 p 3 39 in accordance with point

the protection of undisclosed knowhow and business information trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition use and disclosure text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 114 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 whereas 1 businesses and noncommercial research institutions invest in acquiring developing and applying knowhow and information which is the currency of the knowledge economy and provides a competitive advantage this investment in generating and applying intellectual capital is a determining factor as regards their competitiveness and innovationrelated performance in the market and therefore their returns on investment which is the underlying motivation for business research and development businesses have recourse to different means to appropriate the results of their innovationrelated activities when openness does not allow for the full exploitation of their investment in research and innovation use of intellectual property rights such as patents design rights or copyright is one such means another means of appropriating the results of innovation is to protect access to and exploit knowledge that is valuable to the entity and not widely known such valuable knowhow and business information that is undisclosed and intended to remain confidential is referred to as a trade secret 2 businesses irrespective of their size value trade secrets as much as patents and other forms of intellectual property right they use confidentiality as a business competitiveness and research innovation management tool and in relation to a diverse range of information that extends beyond technological knowledge to commercial data such as information on customers and suppliers business plans and market research and strategies small and mediumsized enterprises smes value and rely on trade secrets even more by protecting such a wide range 1562016 l 1571 official journal of the european union en 1 oj c 226 1672014 p 48 2 position of the european parliament of 14 april 2016 not yet published in the official journal and decision of the council of 27 may 2016 of knowhow and business information whether as a complement or as an alternative to intellectual property rights trade secrets allow creators and innovators to derive profit from their creation or innovation and therefore are particularly important for business competitiveness as well as for research and development and innovationrelated performance 3 open innovation is a catalyst for new ideas which meet the needs of consumers and tackle societal challenges and allows those ideas to find their way to the market such innovation is an important lever for the creation of new knowledge and underpins the emergence of new and innovative business models based on the use of co created knowledge collaborative research including crossborder cooperation is particularly important in increasing the levels of business research and development within the internal market the dissemination of knowledge and information should be considered as being essential for the purpose of ensuring dynamic positive and equal business development opportunities in particular for smes in an internal market in which barriers to crossborder collaboration are minimised and cooperation is not distorted intellectual creation and innovation should encourage investment in innovative processes services and products such an environment conducive to intellectual creation and innovation and in which employment mobility is not hindered is also important for employment growth and for improving the competitiveness of the union economy trade secrets have an important role in protecting the exchange of knowledge between businesses including in particular smes and research institutions both within and across the borders of the internal market in the context of research and development and innovation trade secrets are one of the most commonly used forms of protection of intellectual creation and innovative knowhow by businesses yet at the same time they are the least protected by the existing union legal framework against their unlawful acquisition use or disclosure by other parties 4 innovative businesses are increasingly exposed to dishonest practices aimed at misappropriating trade secrets such as theft unauthorised copying economic espionage or the breach of confidentiality requirements whether from within or from outside of the union recent developments such as globalisation increased outsourcing longer supply chains and the increased use of information and communication technology contribute to increasing the risk of those practices the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret compromises legitimate trade secret holders ability to obtain firstmover returns from their innovationrelated efforts without effective and comparable legal means for protecting trade secrets across the union incentives to engage in innovationrelated crossborder activity within the internal market are undermined and trade secrets are unable to fulfil their potential as drivers of economic growth and jobs thus innovation and creativity are discouraged and investment diminishes thereby affecting the smooth functioning of the internal market and undermining its growthenhancing potential 5 international efforts made in the framework of the world trade organisation to address this problem led to the conclusion of the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights the trips agreement the trips agreement contains inter alia provisions on the protection of trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition use or disclosure by third parties which are common international standards all member states as well as the union itself are bound by this agreement which was approved by council decision 94800ec 1 6 notwithstanding the trips agreement there are important differences in the member states legislation as regards the protection of trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition use or disclosure by other persons for example not all member states have adopted national definitions of a trade secret or the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret therefore knowledge on the scope of protection is not readily accessible and that scope differs across the member states furthermore there is no consistency as regards the civil law remedies available in the event of unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of trade secrets as cease and desist orders are not always available in all member states against third parties who are not competitors of the legitimate trade secret holder divergences also exist across the member states with respect to the treatment of a third party who has acquired the trade secret in good faith but subsequently learns at the time of use that the acquisition derived from a previous unlawful acquisition by another party 7 national rules also differ as to whether legitimate trade secret holders are allowed to seek the destruction of goods produced by third parties who use trade secrets unlawfully or the return or destruction of any documents 1562016 l 1572 official journal of the european union en 1 council decision 94800ec of 22 december 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the european community as regards matters within its competence of the agreements reached in the uruguay round multilateral negotiations 19861994 oj l 336 23121994 p 1 files or materials containing or embodying the unlawfully acquired or used trade secret furthermore applicable national rules on the calculation of damages do not always take account of the intangible nature of trade secrets which makes it difficult to demonstrate the actual profits lost or the unjust enrichment of the infringer where no market value can be established for the information in question only a few member states allow for the application of abstract rules on the calculation of damages based on the reasonable royalty or fee which could have been due had a licence for the use of the trade secret existed additionally many national rules do not provide for appropriate protection of the confidentiality of a trade secret where the trade secret holder introduces a claim for alleged unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of the trade secret by a third party thereby reducing the attractiveness of the existing measures and remedies and weakening the protection offered 8 the differences in the legal protection of trade secrets provided for by the member states imply that trade secrets do not enjoy an equivalent level of protection throughout the union thus leading to fragmentation of the internal market in this area and a weakening of the overall deterrent effect of the relevant rules the internal market is affected in so far as such differences lower the incentives for businesses to undertake innovationrelated crossborder economic activity including research cooperation or production cooperation with partners outsourcing or investment in other member states which depends on the use of information that enjoys protection as trade secrets crossborder network research and development as well as innovationrelated activities including related production and subsequent crossborder trade are rendered less attractive and more difficult within the union thus also resulting in unionwide innovationrelated inefficiencies 9 in addition there is a higher risk for businesses in member states with comparatively lower levels of protection due to the fact that trade secrets may be stolen or otherwise unlawfully acquired more easily this leads to inefficient allocation of capital to growthenhancing innovation within the internal market because of the higher expenditure on protective measures to compensate for the insufficient legal protection in some member states it also favours the activity of unfair competitors who subsequent to the unlawful acquisition of trade secrets could spread goods resulting from such acquisition across the internal market differences in legislative regimes also facilitate the importation of goods from third countries into the union through entry points with weaker protection when the design production or marketing of those goods rely on stolen or otherwise unlawfully acquired trade secrets on the whole such differences hinder the proper functioning of the internal market 10 it is appropriate to provide for rules at union level to approximate the laws of the member states so as to ensure that there is a sufficient and consistent level of civil redress in the internal market in the event of unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret those rules should be without prejudice to the possibility for member states of providing for more farreaching protection against the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of trade secrets as long as the safeguards explicitly provided for in this directive for protecting the interests of other parties are respected 11 this directive should not affect the application of union or national rules that require the disclosure of information including trade secrets to the public or to public authorities nor should it affect the application of rules that allow public authorities to collect information for the performance of their duties or rules that allow or require any subsequent disclosure by those public authorities of relevant information to the public such rules include in particular rules on the disclosure by the unions institutions and bodies or national public authorities of businessrelated information they hold pursuant to regulation ec no 10492001 of the european parliament and of the council 1 regulation ec no 13672006 of the european parliament and of the council 2 and directive 20034ec of the european parliament and of the council 3 or pursuant to other rules on public access to documents or on the transparency obligations of national public authorities 12 this directive should not affect the right of social partners to enter into collective agreements where provided for under labour law as regards any obligation not to disclose a trade secret or to limit its use and the 1562016 l 1573 official journal of the european union en 1 regulation ec no 10492001 of the european parliament and of

does not restrict the exceptions laid down in this directive when an application for measures procedures or remedies provided for in this directive for alleged acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret is to be dismissed 13 this directive should not be understood as restricting the freedom of establishment the free movement of workers or the mobility of workers as provided for in union law nor is it intended to affect the possibility of concluding noncompetition agreements between employers and employees in accordance with applicable law 14 it is important to establish a homogenous definition of a trade secret without restricting the subject matter to be protected against misappropriation such definition should therefore be constructed so as to cover knowhow business information and technological information where there is both a legitimate interest in keeping them confidential and a legitimate expectation that such confidentiality will be preserved furthermore such know how or information should have a commercial value whether actual or potential such knowhow or information should be considered to have a commercial value for example where its unlawful acquisition use or disclosure is likely to harm the interests of the person lawfully controlling it in that it undermines that persons scientific and technical potential business or financial interests strategic positions or ability to compete the definition of trade secret excludes trivial information and the experience and skills gained by employees in the normal course of their employment and also excludes information which is generally known among or is readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question 15 it is also important to identify the circumstances in which legal protection of trade secrets is justified for this reason it is necessary to establish the conduct and practices which are to be regarded as unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret 16 in the interest of innovation and to foster competition the provisions of this directive should not create any exclusive right to knowhow or information protected as trade secrets thus the independent discovery of the same knowhow or information should remain possible reverse engineering of a lawfully acquired product should be considered as a lawful means of acquiring information except when otherwise contractually agreed the freedom to enter into such contractual arrangements can however be limited by law 17 in some industry sectors where creators and innovators cannot benefit from exclusive rights and where innovation has traditionally relied upon trade secrets products can nowadays be easily reverseengineered once in the market in such cases those creators and innovators can be victims of practices such as parasitic copying or slavish imitations that freeride on their reputation and innovation efforts some national laws dealing with unfair competition address those practices while this directive does not aim to reform or harmonise the law on unfair competition in general it would be appropriate that the commission carefully examine the need for union action in that area 18 furthermore the acquisition use or disclosure of trade secrets whenever imposed or permitted by law should be treated as lawful for the purposes of this directive this concerns in particular the acquisition and disclosure of trade secrets in the context of the exercise of the rights of workers representatives to information consultation and participation in accordance with union law and national laws and practices and the collective defence of the interests of workers and employers including codetermination as well as the acquisition or disclosure of a trade secret in the context of statutory audits performed in accordance with union or national law however such treatment of the acquisition of a trade secret as lawful should be without prejudice to any obligation of confidenxad tiality as regards the trade secret or any limitation as to its use that union or national law imposes on the recipient or acquirer of the information in particular this directive should not release public authorities from the confidentiality obligations to which they are subject in respect of information passed on by trade secret holders irrespective of whether those obligations are laid down in union or national law such confidentiality obligations include inter alia the obligations in respect of information forwarded to contracting authorities in the context of procurement procedures as laid down for example in directive 201423eu of the european 1562016 l 1574 official journal of the european union en parliament and of the council 1 directive 201424eu of the european parliament and of the council 2 and directive 201425eu of the european parliament and of the council 3 19 while this directive provides for measures and remedies which can consist of preventing the disclosure of information in order to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets it is essential that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information which encompasses media freedom and pluralism as reflected in article 11 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the charter not be restricted in particular with regard to investigative journalism and the protection of journalistic sources 20 the measures procedures and remedies provided for in this directive should not restrict whistleblowing activity therefore the protection of trade secrets should not extend to cases in which disclosure of a trade secret serves the public interest insofar as directly relevant misconduct wrongdoing or illegal activity is revealed this should not be seen as preventing the competent judicial authorities from allowing an exception to the application of measures procedures and remedies in a case where the respondent had every reason to believe in good faith that his or her conduct satisfied the appropriate criteria set out in this directive 21 in line with the principle of proportionality measures procedures and remedies intended to protect trade secrets should be tailored to meet the objective of a smoothfunctioning internal market for research and innovation in particular by deterring the unlawful acquisition use and disclosure of a trade secret such tailoring of measures procedures and remedies should not jeopardise or undermine fundamental rights and freedoms or the public interest such as public safety consumer protection public health and environmental protection and should be without prejudice to the mobility of workers in this respect the measures procedures and remedies provided for in this directive are aimed at ensuring that competent judicial authorities take into account factors such as the value of a trade secret the seriousness of the conduct resulting in the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of the trade secret and the impact of such conduct it should also be ensured that the competent judicial authorities have the discretion to weigh up the interests of the parties to the legal proceedings as well as the interests of third parties including where appropriate consumers 22 the smoothfunctioning of the internal market would be undermined if the measures procedures and remedies provided for were used to pursue illegitimate intents incompatible with the objectives of this directive therefore it is important to empower judicial authorities to adopt appropriate measures with regard to applicants who act abusively or in bad faith and submit manifestly unfounded applications with for example the aim of unfairly delaying or restricting the respondents access to the market or otherwise intimidating or harassing the respondent 23 in the interest of legal certainty and considering that legitimate trade secret holders are expected to exercise a duty of care as regards the preservation of the confidentiality of their valuable trade secrets and the monitoring of their use it is appropriate to restrict substantive claims or the possibility of initiating actions for the protection of trade secrets to a limited period national law should also specify in a clear and unambiguous manner from when that period is to begin to run and under what circumstances that period is to be interrupted or suspended 24 the prospect of losing the confidentiality of a trade secret in the course of legal proceedings often deters legitimate trade secret holders from instituting legal proceedings to defend their trade secrets thus jeopardising the effectiveness of the measures procedures and remedies provided for for this reason it is necessary to establish subject to appropriate safeguards ensuring the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial specific requirements aimed at protecting the confidentiality of the litigated trade secret in the course of legal proceedings instituted for its defence such protection should remain in force after the legal proceedings have ended and for as long as the information constituting the trade secret is not in the public domain 1562016 l 1575 official journal of the european union en 1 directive 201423eu of the european parliament and of the council of 26 february 2014 on the award of concession contracts oj l 94 2832014 p 1 2 directive 201424eu of the european parliament and of the council of 26 february 2014 on public procurement and repealing directive 200418ec oj l 94 2832014 p 65 3 directive 201425eu of the european parliament and of the council of 26 february 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the water energy transport and postal services sectors and repealing directive 200417ec oj l 94 2832014 p 243 25 such requirements should include as a minimum the possibility of restricting the circle of persons entitled to have access to evidence or hearings bearing in mind that all such persons should be subject to the confidentiality requirements set out in this directive and of publishing only the nonconfidential elements of judicial decisions in this context considering that assessing the nature of the information which is the subject of a dispute is one of the main purposes of legal proceedings it is particularly important to ensure both the effective protection of the confidentiality of trade secrets and respect for the right of the parties to those proceedings to an effective remedy and to a fair trial the restricted circle of persons should therefore consist of at least one natural person from each of the parties as well as the respective lawyers of the parties and where applicable other represenxad tatives appropriately qualified in accordance with national law in order to defend represent or serve the interests of a party in legal proceedings covered by this directive who should all have full access to such evidence or hearings in the event that one of the parties is a legal person that party should be able to propose a natural person or natural persons who ought to form part of that circle of persons so as to ensure proper representation of that legal person subject to appropriate judicial control to prevent the objective of the restriction of access to evidence and hearings from being undermined such safeguards should not be understood as requiring the parties to be represented by a lawyer or another representative in the course of legal proceedings where such represenxad tation is not required by national law nor should they be understood as restricting the competence of the courts to decide in conformity with the applicable rules and practices of the member state concerned whether and to what extent relevant court officials should also have full access to evidence and hearings for the exercise of their duties 26 the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret by a third party could have devastating effects on the legitimate trade secret holder as once publicly disclosed it would be impossible for that holder to revert to the situation prior to the loss of the trade secret as a result it is essential to provide for fast effective and accessible provisional measures for the immediate termination of the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret including where it is used for the provision of services it is essential that such relief be available without having to await a decision on the merits of the case while having due respect for the right of defence and the principle of proportionality and having regard to the characteristics of the case in certain instances it should be possible to permit the alleged infringer subject to the lodging of one or more guarantees to continue to use the trade secret in particular where there is little risk that it will enter the public domain it should also be possible to require guarantees of a level sufficient to cover the costs and the injury caused to the respondent by an unjustified application particularly where any delay would cause irreparable harm to the legitimate trade secret holder 27 for the same reasons it is also important to provide for definitive measures to prevent unlawful use or disclosure of a trade secret including where it is used for the provision of services for such measures to be effective and proportionate their duration when circumstances require a limitation in time should be sufficient to eliminate any commercial advantage which the third party could have derived from the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of the trade secret in any event no measure of this type should be enforceable if the information originally covered by the trade secret is in the public domain for reasons that cannot be attributed to the respondent 28 it is possible that a trade secret could be used unlawfully to design produce or market goods or components thereof which could be spread across the internal market thus affecting the commercial interests of the trade secret holder and the functioning of the internal market in such cases and when the trade secret in question has a significant impact on the quality value or price of the goods resulting from that unlawful use or on reducing the cost of facilitating or speeding up their production or marketing processes it is important to empower judicial authorities to order effective and appropriate measures with a view to ensuring that those goods are not put on the market or are withdrawn from it considering the global nature of trade it is also necessary that such measures include the prohibition of the importation of those goods into the union or their storage for the purposes of offering or placing them on the market having regard to the principle of proportionality corrective measures should not necessarily entail the destruction of the goods if other viable options are present such as depriving the good of its infringing quality or the disposal of the goods outside the market for example by means of donations to charitable organisations 29 a person could have originally acquired a trade secret in good faith but only become aware at a later stage including upon notice served by the original trade secret holder that that persons knowledge of the trade secret in question derived from sources using or disclosing the relevant trade secret in an unlawful manner in order to avoid under those circumstances the corrective measures or injunctions provided for causing disproportionate harm to that person member states should provide for the possibility in appropriate cases of pecuniary compensation being awarded to the injured party as an alternative measure such compensation should not 1562016 l 1576 official journal of the european union en however exceed the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due had that person obtained authorisxad ation to use the trade secret in question for the period of time for which use of the trade secret could have been prevented by the original trade secret holder nevertheless where the unlawful use of the trade secret would constitute an infringement of law other than that provided for in this directive or would be likely to harm consumers such unlawful use should not be allowed 30 in order to avoid a person who knowingly or with reasonable grounds for knowing unlawfully acquires uses or discloses a trade secret being able to benefit from such conduct and to ensure that the injured trade secret holder to the extent possible is placed in the position in which he she or it would have been had that conduct not taken place it is necessary to provide for adequate compensation for the prejudice suffered as a result of that unlawful conduct the amount of damages awarded to the injured trade secret holder should take account of all appropriate factors such as loss of earnings incurred by the trade secret holder or unfair profits made by the infringer and where appropriate any moral prejudice caused to the trade secret holder as an alternative for example where considering the intangible nature of trade secrets it would be difficult to determine the amount of the actual prejudice suffered the amount of the damages might be derived from elements such as the royalties or fees which would have been due had the infringer requested authorisation to use the trade secret in question the aim of that alternative method is not to introduce an obligation to provide for punitive damages but to ensure compensation based on an objective criterion while taking account of the expenses incurred by the trade secret holder such as the costs of identification and research this directive should not prevent member states from providing in their national law that the liability for damages of employees is restricted in cases where they have acted without intent 31 as a supplementary deterrent to future infringers and to contribute to the awareness of the public at large it is useful to publicise decisions including where appropriate through prominent advertising in cases concerning the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of trade secrets on the condition that such publication does not result in the disclosure of the trade secret or disproportionally affect the privacy and reputation of a natural person 32 the effectiveness of the measures procedures and remedies available to trade secret holders could be undermined in the event of noncompliance with the relevant decisions adopted by the competent judicial authorities for this reason it is necessary to ensure that those authorities enjoy the appropriate powers of sanction 33 in order to facilitate the uniform application of the measures procedures and remedies provided for in this directive it is appropriate to provide for systems of cooperation and the exchange of information as between member states on the one hand and between the member states and the commission on the other in particular by creating a network of correspondents designated by member states in addition in order to review whether those measures fulfil their intended objective the commission assisted as appropriate by the european union intellectual property office should examine the application of this directive and the effectiveness of the national measures taken 34 this directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the charter notably the right to respect for private and family life the right to protection of personal data the freedom of expression and information the freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work the freedom to conduct a business the right to property the right to good administration and in particular the access to files while respecting business secrecy the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and the right of defence 35 it is important that the rights to respect for private and family life and to protection of personal data of any person whose personal data may be processed by the trade secret holder when taking steps to protect a trade secret or of any person involved in legal proceedings concerning the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of trade secrets under this directive and whose personal data are processed be respected directive 9546ec of the european parliament and of the council 1 governs the processing of personal data carried out in the member states in the context of this directive and under the supervision of the member states competent authorities in particular the public independent authorities designated by the member states thus this directive should not affect the rights and obligations laid down in directive 9546ec in particular the rights of the data subject to 1562016 l 1577 official journal of the european union en 1 directive 9546ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data oj l 281 23111995 p 31 access his or her personal data being processed and to obtain the rectification erasure or blocking of the data where it is incomplete or inaccurate and where appropriate the obligation to process sensitive data in accordance with article 85 of directive 9546ec 36 since the objective of this directive namely to achieve a smoothfunctioning internal market by means of the establishment of a sufficient and comparable level of redress across the internal market in the event of the unlawful acquisition use or disclosure of a trade secret cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states but can rather by reason of its scale and effects be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 37 this directive does not aim to establish harmonised rules for judicial cooperation jurisdiction the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters or deal with applicable law other union instruments which govern such matters in general terms should in principle remain equally applicable to the field covered by this directive 38 this directive should not affect the application of competition law rules in particular articles 101 and 102 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu the measures procedures and remedies provided for in this directive should not be used to restrict unduly competition in a manner contrary to the tfeu 39 this directive should not affect the application of any other relevant law in other areas including intellectual property rights and the law of contract however where the scope of application of directive 200448ec of the european parliament and of the council 1 and the scope of this directive overlap this directive takes precedence as lex specialis 40 the european data protection supervisor was consulted in accordance with article 282 of regulation ec no 452001 of the european parliament and of the council 2 and

the treaty and in the general programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment which was begun by the first council directive 68151eec 10 is especially important in relation to public limited liability companies because their activities predominate in the economy of the member states and frequently extend beyond their national boundaries 3 in order to ensure minimum equivalent protection for both shareholders and creditors of public limited liability companies the coordination of national provisions relating to the formation of such companies and to the maintenance increase or reduction of their capital is particularly important 3062017 l 16947 official journal of the european union en 1 oj c 264 2072016 p 82 2 position of the european parliament of

paragraph of article 58 of the treaty with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the community oj l 65 1431968 p 8 4 in the union the statutes or instrument of incorporation of a public limited liability company must make it possible for any interested person to acquaint oneself with the basic particulars of the company including the exact composition of its capital 5 the protection of third parties should be ensured by provisions which restrict to the greatest possible extent the grounds on which obligations entered into in the name of companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability are not valid 6 it is necessary in order to ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between companies and third parties and also between members to limit the cases in which nullity can arise and the retroactive effect of a declaration of nullity and to fix a short time limit within which third parties may enter an objection to any such declaration 7 the coordination of national provisions concerning disclosure the validity of obligations entered into by and the nullity of companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability is of special importance particularly for the purpose of protecting the interests of third parties 8 the basic documents of a company should be disclosed in order for third parties to be able to ascertain their contents and other information concerning the company especially particulars of the persons who are authorised to bind the company 9 without prejudice to substantive requirements and formalities established by the national law of the member states companies should be able to choose to file their compulsory documents and particulars by paper means or by electronic means 10 interested parties should be able to obtain from the register a copy of such documents and particulars by paper means as well as by electronic means 11 member states should be allowed to decide to keep the national gazette designated for publication of compulsory documents and particulars in paper form or electronic form or to provide for disclosure by equally effective means 12 crossborder access to company information should be facilitated by allowing in addition to the compulsory disclosure made in one of the languages permitted in the companys member state the voluntary registration in additional languages of the required documents and particulars third parties acting in good faith should be able to rely on the translations thereof 13 it is appropriate to clarify that the statement of the compulsory particulars set out in this directive should be included in all company letters and order forms whether they are in paper form or use any other medium in the light of technological developments it is also appropriate to provide that that statement of compulsory particulars be placed on any company website 14 the opening of a branch like the creation of a subsidiary is one of the possibilities currently open to companies in the exercise of their right of establishment in another member state 15 in respect of branches the lack of coordination in particular concerning disclosure gives rise to some disparities in the protection of shareholders and third parties between companies which operate in other member states by opening branches and those which operate there by creating subsidiaries 16 to ensure the protection of persons who deal with companies through the intermediary of branches measures in respect of disclosure are required in the member state in which a branch is situated in certain respects the economic and social influence of a branch can be comparable to that of a subsidiary company so that there is public interest in disclosure of the company at the branch to effect such disclosure it is necessary to make use of the procedure already instituted for companies with share capital within the union 17 such disclosure relates to a range of important documents and particulars and amendments thereto 18 such disclosure with the exception of the powers of representation the name and legal form and the winding up of the company and the insolvency proceedings to which it is subject can be confined to information concerning a branch itself together with a reference to the register of the company of which that branch is part since under existing union rules all information covering the company as such is available in that register 3062017 l 16948 official journal of the european union en 19 national provisions in respect of the disclosure of accounting documents relating to a branch can no longer be justified following the coordination of national law in respect of the drawing up audit and disclosure of companies accounting documents it is accordingly sufficient to disclose in the register of the branch the accounting documents as audited and disclosed by the company 20 letters and order forms used by a branch should give at least the same information as letters and order forms used by the company and state the register in which the branch is entered 21 to ensure that the purposes of this directive are fully realised and to avoid any discrimination on the basis of a companys country of origin this directive should also cover branches opened by companies governed by the law of third countries and set up in legal forms comparable to companies to which this directive applies for such branches it is necessary to apply specific provisions that are different from those that apply to the branches of companies governed by the law of other member states since this directive does not apply to companies from third countries 22 this directive in no way affects the disclosure requirements for branches under other provisions of for example employment law on workers rights to information and tax law or for statistical purposes 23 the interconnection of central commercial and companies registers is a measure required to create a more businessfriendly legal and fiscal environment it should contribute to fostering the competitiveness of european business by reducing administrative burdens and increasing legal certainty and thus contributing to an exit from the global economic and financial crisis which is one of the priorities of the agenda of europe 2020 it should also improve crossborder communication between registers by using innovations in information and communixad cation technology 24 the multiannual european ejustice action plan 20092013 1 provided for the development of a european ejustice portal the portal as the single european electronic access point for legal information judicial and administrative institutions registers databases and other services and considers the interconnection of central commercial and companies registers to be important 25 crossborder access to business information on companies and their branches opened in other member states can only be improved if all member states engage in enabling electronic communication to take place between registers and transmitting information to individual users in a standardised way by means of identical content and interoperable technologies throughout the union this interoperability of registers should be ensured by the registers of member states domestic registers providing services which should constitute interfaces with the european central platform the platform the platform should be a centralised set of information technology tools integrating services and should form a common interface that interface should be used by all domestic registers the platform should also provide services constituting an interface with the portal serving as the european electronic access point and to the optional access points established by member states the platform should be conceived only as an instrument for the interconnection of registers and not as a distinct entity possessing legal personality on the basis of unique identifiers the platform should be capable of distributing information from each of the member states registers to the competent registers of other member states in a standard message format an electronic form of messages exchanged between information technology systems such as for example xml and in the relevant language version 26 this directive is not aimed at establishing any centralised registers database storing substantive information about companies at the stage of implementation of the system of interconnection of central commercial and companies registers the system of interconnection of registers only the set of data necessary for the correct functioning of the platform should be defined the scope of those data should include in particular operational data dictionaries and glossaries it should be determined taking also into account the need to ensure the efficient operation of the system of interconnection of registers those data should be used for the purpose of enabling the platform to perform its functions and should never be made publicly available in a direct form moreover the platform should modify neither the content of the data on companies stored in domestic registers nor the information about companies transmitted through the system of interconnection of registers 3062017 l 16949 official journal of the european union en 1 oj c 75 3132009 p 1 27 since the objective of directive 201217eu of the european parliament and of the council 1 was not to harmonise national systems of central commercial and companies registers that directive did not impose any obligation on member states to change their internal systems of registers in particular as regards the management and storage of data fees and the use and disclosure of information for national purposes 28 the portal should deal through the use of the platform with queries submitted by individual users concerning the information on companies and their branches opened in other member states which is stored in the domestic registers that should enable the search results to be presented on the portal including the explanatory labels in all the official languages of the union listing the information provided in addition in order to improve the protection of third parties in other member states basic information on the legal value of documents and particulars disclosed pursuant to the laws of member states adopted in accordance with this directive should be available on the portal 29 member states should be able to establish one or more optional access points which may have an impact on the use and operation of the platform therefore the commission should be notified of their establishment and of any significant changes to their operation in particular of their closure such notification should not in any way restrict the powers of member states as to the establishment and operation of the optional access points 30 companies and their branches opened in other member states should have a unique identifier allowing them to be unequivocally identified within the union the identifier is intended to be used for communication between registers through the system of interconnection of registers therefore companies and branches should not be obliged to include the unique identifier in the company letters or order forms mentioned in this directive they should continue to use their domestic registration number for their own communication purposes 31 it should be made possible to establish a clear connection between the register of a company and the registers of its branches opened in other member states consisting of the exchange of information on the opening and termination of any windingup or insolvency proceedings of the company and on the strikingoff of the company from the register if this entails legal consequences in the member state of the register of the company while member states should be able to decide on the procedures they follow with respect to the branches registered in their territory they should ensure at least that the branches of a dissolved company are struck off the register without undue delay and if applicable after liquidation proceedings of the branch concerned this obligation should not apply to branches of companies that have been struck off the register but which have a legal successor such as in the case of any change in the legal form of the company a merger or division or a crossborder transfer of its registered office 32 the provisions of this directive relating to the interconnection of registers should not apply to a branch opened in a member state by a company which is not governed by the law of a member state 33 member states should ensure that in the event of any changes to information entered in the registers concerning companies the information is updated without undue delay the update should be disclosed normally within 21 days of receipt of the complete documentation regarding those changes including the legality check in accordance with national law that time limit should be interpreted as requiring member states to make reasonable efforts to meet the deadline laid down in this directive it should not be applicable as regards the accounting documents which companies are obliged to submit for each financial year that exclusion is justified by the overload of work on domestic registers during reporting periods in accordance with general legal principles common to all member states the time limit of 21 days should be suspended in cases of force majeure 34 if the commission decides to develop andor operate the platform through a third party this should be done in accordance with regulation eu euratom no 9662012 of the european parliament and of the council 2 an appropriate degree of member states involvement in this process should be ensured by establishing the technical specifications for the purpose of the public procurement procedure by means of implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 5 of regulation eu no 1822011 of the european parliament and of the council 3 3062017 l 16950 official journal of the european union en 1 directive 201217eu of the european parliament and of the council of 13 june 2012 amending council directive

continuity of the provision of services by the system of interconnection of registers and a proper public supervision of the functioning of the platform should be ensured detailed rules on the operational management of the platform should be adopted by means of implementing acts adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 5 of regulation eu no 1822011 in any case the involvement of member states in the functioning of the whole system should be ensured by means of a regular dialogue between the commission and the representatives of member states on the issues concerning the operation of the system of interconnection of registers and its future development 36 the interconnection of central commercial and companies registers necessitates the coordination of national systems having varying technical characteristics this entails the adoption of technical measures and specifications which need to take account of differences between registers in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this directive implementing powers should be conferred on the commission to tackle those technical and operational issues those powers should be exercised in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 5 of regulation eu no 1822011 37 this directive should not limit the right of member states to charge fees for obtaining information on companies through the system of interconnection of registers if such fees are required under national law therefore technical measures and specifications for the system of interconnection of registers should allow for the establishment of payment modalities in this respect this directive should not prejudge any specific technical solution as the payment modalities should be determined at the stage of adoption of the implementing acts taking into account widely available online payment facilities 38 it could be desirable for third countries to be able in the future to participate in the system of interconnection of registers 39 an equitable solution regarding the funding of the system of interconnection of registers entails participation both by the union and by its member states in the financing of that system member states should bear the financial burden of adjusting their domestic registers to that system while the central elements namely the platform and the portal serving as the european electronic access point should be funded from an appropriate budget line in the general budget of the union in order to supplement nonessential elements of this directive the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty should be delegated to the commission in respect of the charging of fees for obtaining company information this does not affect the possibility for the domestic registers to charge fees but it could involve an additional fee in order to cofinance the maintenance and functioning of the platform it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consulxad tations during its preparatory work including at expert level the commission when preparing and drawing up delegated acts should ensure a simultaneous timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council 40 union provisions are necessary for maintaining the capital which constitutes the creditors security in particular by prohibiting any reduction thereof by distribution to shareholders where the latter are not entitled to it and by imposing limits on the right of public limited liability companies to acquire their own shares 41 the restrictions on a public limited liability companys acquisition of its own shares apply not only to acquisitions made by a company itself but also to those made by any person acting in his own name but on the companys behalf 42 in order to prevent a public limited liability company from using another company in which it holds a majority of the voting rights or on which it can exercise a dominant influence to make such acquisitions without complying with the restrictions imposed in that respect the arrangements governing a companys acquisition of its own shares should cover the most important and most frequent cases of the acquisition of shares by such other companies those arrangements should cover subscription for shares in the public limited liability company 43 in order to prevent the circumvention of this directive companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability governed by this directive and companies governed by the laws of third countries and having comparable legal forms should also be covered by the arrangements referred to in recital 42 44 where the relationship between a public limited liability company and another company such as referred to in recital 42 is only indirect it would appear to be justified to relax the provisions applicable when that relationship is direct by providing for the suspension of voting rights as a minimum measure for the purpose of achieving the aims of this directive 3062017 l 16951 official journal of the european union en 45 furthermore it is justifiable to exempt cases in which the specific nature of a professional activity rules out the possibility of the attainment of the objectives of this directive being endangered 46 it is necessary having regard to the objectives of article 502g of the treaty that the member states laws relating to the increase or reduction of capital ensure that the principles of equal treatment of shareholders in the same position and of protection of creditors whose claims exist prior to the decision on reduction are observed and harmonised 47 in order to enhance standardised creditor protection in all member states creditors should be able to resort under certain conditions to judicial or administrative proceedings where their claims are at stake as a consequence of a reduction in the capital of a public limited liability company 48 in order to ensure that market abuse is prevented member states should take into account for the purpose of the implementation of this directive the provisions of regulation eu no 5962014 of the european parliament and of the council 1 49 the protection of the interests of members and third parties requires that the laws of the member states relating to mergers of public limited liability companies be coordinated and that provision for mergers be made in the laws of all the member states 50 in the context of such coordination it is particularly important that the shareholders of merging companies be kept adequately informed in as objective a manner as possible and that their rights be suitably protected however there is no reason to require an examination of the draft terms of a merger by an independent expert for the shareholders if all the shareholders agree that it can be dispensed with 51 creditors including debenture holders and persons having other claims on the merging companies should be protected so that the merger does not adversely affect their interests 52 the disclosure requirements for the protection of the interests of members and third parties should include mergers so that third parties are kept adequately informed 53 the safeguards afforded to members and third parties in connection with mergers of public limited liability companies should cover certain legal practices which in important respects are similar to merger so that the obligation to provide such protection cannot be evaded 54 to ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between the companies concerned between them and third parties and between the members it is necessary to limit the cases in which nullity can arise by providing that defects be remedied wherever that is possible and by restricting the period within which nullification proceedings can be commenced 55 this directive also facilitates the crossborder merger of limited liability companies the laws of the member states should allow the crossborder merger of a national limited liability company with a limited liability company from another member state if the national law of the relevant member states permits mergers between such types of company 56 in order to facilitate crossborder merger operations it should be specified that unless this directive provides otherwise each company taking part in a crossborder merger and each third party concerned remains subject to the provisions and formalities of the national law which would be applicable in the case of a national merger none of the provisions and formalities of national law to which reference is made in this directive should introduce restrictions on freedom of establishment or on the free movement of capital save where these can be justified in accordance with the caselaw of the court of justice of the european union and in particular by requirements of the general interest and are both necessary for and proportionate to the attainment of such overriding requirements 57 the common draft terms of a crossborder merger should be drawn up in the same terms for each of the companies concerned in the various member states the minimum content of such common draft terms should therefore be specified while leaving the companies free to agree on other terms

members and others both the common draft terms of the crossborder merger and the completion of the crossborder merger should be publicised for each merging company via an entry in the appropriate public register 59 the laws of all the member states should provide for the drawingup at national level of a report on the common draft terms of the crossborder merger by one or more experts on behalf of each of the companies that are merging in order to limit experts costs connected with crossborder mergers provision should be made for the possibility of drawing up a single report intended for all members of companies taking part in a crossborder merger operation the common draft terms of the crossborder merger should be approved by the general meeting of each of those companies 60 in order to facilitate crossborder merger operations it should be provided that monitoring of the completion and legality of the decisionmaking process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies whereas monitoring of the completion and legality of the crossborder merger should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over the company resulting from the crossborder merger the national authority in question could be a court a notary or any other competent authority appointed by the member state concerned the national law determining the date on which the crossborder merger takes effect this being the law to which the company resulting from the cross border merger is subject should also be specified 61 in order to protect the interests of members and others the legal effects of the crossborder merger distinxad guishing as to whether the company resulting from the crossborder merger is an acquiring company or a new company should be specified in the interests of legal certainty it should no longer be possible after the date on which a crossborder merger takes effect to declare the merger null and void 62 this directive is without prejudice to the application of the legislation on the control of concentrations between undertakings both at union level by council regulation ec no 1392004 1 and at member state level 63 this directive does not affect union legislation regulating credit intermediaries and other financial undertakings and national rules made or introduced pursuant to such union legislation 64 this directive is without prejudice to member state legislation demanding information on the place of central administration or the principal place of business proposed for the company resulting from the crossborder merger 65 employees rights other than rights of participation should remain subject to the national provisions referred to in council directives 9859ec 2 and 200123ec 3 and in directives 200214ec 4 and 200938ec 5 of the european parliament and of the council 66 if employees have participation rights in one of the merging companies under the circumstances set out in this directive and if the national law of the member state in which the company resulting from the crossborder merger has its registered office does not provide for the same level of participation as operated in the relevant merging companies including in committees of the supervisory board that have decisionmaking powers or does not provide for the same entitlement to exercise rights for employees of establishments resulting from the cross border merger the participation of employees in the company resulting from the crossborder merger and their involvement in the definition of such rights should be regulated to that end the principles and procedures 3062017 l 16953 official journal of the european union en 1 council regulation ec no 1392004 of 20 january 2004

iccu2002u20021 introduction to incoterms 2020 1 the purpose of the text of this introduction is fourfold to explain what the incoterms 2020 rules do and do not do and how they are best incorporated to set out the important fundamentals of the incoterms rules the basic roles and responsibilities of seller and buyer delivery risk and the relationship between the incoterms rules and the contracts surrounding a typical contract of sale for exportimport and also where appropriate for domestic sales to explain how best to choose the right incoterms rule for the particular sale contract and to set out the central changes between incoterms 2010 and incoterms 2020 2 the introduction follows this structure i what the incoterms rules do ii what the incoterms rules do not do iii how best to incorporate the incoterms rules iv delivery risk and costs in the incoterms 2020 rules v incoterms 2020 rules and the carrier vi rules for the contract of sale and their relationship to other contracts vii the eleven incoterms 2020 rulessea and inland waterway and any modes of transport getting it right viii order within the incoterms 2020 rules ix differences between incoterms 2010 and incoterms 2020 x caution with variants of incoterms rules 3 this introduction gives guidance on the use of and about the fundamental principles behind the incoterms 2020 rules incoterms 2020 2u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc i what the incoterms rules do 4 the incoterms rules explain a set of eleven of the most commonlyused threeletter trade terms eg cif dap etc reflecting businesstobusiness practice in contracts for the sale and purchase of goods 5 the incoterms rules describe obligations who does what as between seller and buyer eg who organises carriage or insurance of the goods or who obtains shipping documents and export or importxa0licences risk where and when the seller delivers the goods in other words where risk transfers from seller to buyer and costs which party is responsible for which costs for example transport packaging loading or unloading costs and checking or securityrelated costs the incoterms rules cover these areas in a set of ten articles numbered a1b1 etc the a articles representing the sellers obligations and the b articles representing the buyers obliga tions see paragraph 53 below ii what the incoterms rules do not do 6 the incoterms rules are not in themselvesand are therefore no substitute fora contract of sale they are devised to reflect trade practice for no particular type of goodsand for any they can be used as much for the trading of a bulk cargo of iron ore as for five containers of electronic equipment or ten pallets of airfreighted fresh flowers 7 the incoterms rules do not deal with the following matters whether there is a contract of sale at all the specifications of the goods sold the time place method or currency of payment of the price the remedies which can be sought for breach of the contract ofxa0sale most consequences of delay and other breaches in the performance of contractual obligations the effect of sanctions the imposition of tariffs export or import prohibitions force majeure or hardship intellectual property rights or the method venue or law of dispute resolution in case of such breach incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20023 perhaps most importantly it must be stressed that the incoterms rules do not deal with the transfer of property titleownership of the goods sold 8 these are matters for which the parties need to make specific provision in their contract of sale failure to do so is likely to cause problems later if disputes arise about performance and breach in essence the incoterms 2020 rules are not themselves a contract of sale they only become part of that contract when they are incorporated into a contract which already exists neither do the incoterms rules provide the law applicable to the contract there may be legal regimes which apply to the contract whether international like the conven tion on the international sale of goods cisg or domestic mandatory law relating for example to health and safety or the environment iii how best to incorporate the incoterms rules 9 if parties want the incoterms 2020 rules to apply to their contract the safest way to ensure this is to make that intention clear in their contract through words such as the chosen incoterms rule named port place or point incoterms 2020 10 thus for example cif shanghai incoterms 2020 or dap no 123 abc street importland incoterms 2020 11 leaving the year out could cause problems that may be difficult to resolve the parties a judge or an arbitrator need to be able to determine which version of the incoterms rules applies to the contract 12 the place named next to the chosen incoterms rule is even more important in all incoterms rules except the c rules the named place indicates where the goods are delivered ie where risk transfers from seller to buyer in the d rules the named place is the place of delivery and also the place of destination and the seller must organise carriage to that point in the c rules the named place indicates the destination to which the seller must organise and pay for the carriage of the goods which is not however the place or port of delivery 13 thus an fob sale raising doubt about the port of shipment leaves both parties uncertain as to where the buyer must present the ship to the seller for the shipment and the trans port of the goodsand as to where the seller must deliver the goods on board so as to transfer risk in the goods from seller to buyer again a cpt contract with an unclear named incoterms 2020 4u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc destination will leave both parties in doubt as to the point to which the seller must contract and pay for the transport of the goods 14 it is best to avoid these types of issues by being as geographi cally specific as possible in naming the port place or point as the case may be in the chosen incoterms rule 15 when incorporating a particular incoterms 2020 rule into a sale contract it is not necessary to use the trademark symbol for further guidance on trademark and copyright please refer to httpsiccwboorgincotermscopyright iv delivery risk and costs in the incotermsxa02020xa0rules 16 a named place or port attached to the three letters eg cip las vegas or cif los angeles then is critical in the workings of the incoterms 2020 rules depending on which incoterms 2020 rule is chosen that place will identify either the place or port at which the goods are considered to have been delivered by the seller to the buyer the place of delivery or the place or port to which the seller must organise the carriage of the goods ie their destination or in the case of the d rulesxa0both 17 in all incoterms 2020 rules a2 will define the place or port of deliveryand that place or port is closest to the seller in exw and fca sellers premises and closest to the buyer in dap dpu and ddp 18 the place or port of delivery identified by a2 is critical both for risk and for costs 19 the place or port of delivery under a2 marks the place at which risk transfers from seller to buyer under a3 it is at that place or port that the seller performs its obligation to provide the goods under the contract as reflected in a1 such that the buyer cannot recover against the seller for the loss of or damage to the goods occurring after that point has passed 20 the place or port of delivery under a2 also marks the central point under a9 which allocates costs to seller and buyer in broad terms a9 allocates costs before the point of delivery to the seller and costs after that point to the buyer delivery points extremes and inbetweens the four traditional incoterms rules groups 21 versions of the incoterms rules before 2010 traditionally grouped the rules into four namely e f c and d with e and d lying at extreme poles from each other in terms of the point of delivery and the f and c rules lying in between while the incoterms rules have since 2010 been grouped according incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20025 to the means of transport used the old groupings are still helpful in understanding the point of delivery thus the delivery point in exw is an agreed point for collection of the goods by the buyer whatever the destination to which the buyer will take them at the other extreme in dap dpu and ddp the delivery point is the same as the destination point to which the seller or its carrier will carry the goods in the first exw risk transfers before the transport cycle even starts in the second the d rules risk transfers very late in that cycle again in the first exw and for that matter fca sellers premises the seller performs its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not they actually arrive at their destination in the second the seller performs its obligation to deliver the goods only if they actually arrive at their destination 22 the two rules at the extreme ends of the incoterms rules are exw and ddp however traders should consider alternative rules to these two for their international contracts thus with exw the seller has to merely put the goods at the buyers disposal this may cause problems for the seller and the buyer respectively with loading and export clearance the seller would be better advised to sell under the fca rule likewise with ddp the seller owes some obligations to the buyer which can only be performed within the buyers country for example obtaining import clearance it may be physically or legally difficult for the seller to carry out those obligations within the buyers country and a seller would therefore be better advised to consider selling goods in such circumstances under the dap or dpu rules 23 between the two extremes of e and d rules there lie the three f rules fca fas and fob and the four c rules cpt cip cfr and cif 24 with all seven f and c rules the place of delivery is on the sellers side of the anticipated carriage consequently sales using these incoterms rules are often called shipment sales delivery occurs for example a when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the port of loading in cfr cif and fob or b by handing the goods over to the carrier in cpt and cip or c by loading them on the means of transport provided by the buyer or placing them at the disposal of the buyers carrier inxa0fca in the f and c groups risk transfers at the sellers end of the main carriage such that the seller will have performed its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not the goods actually arrive at their destination this feature of being shipment sales with delivery happening at the sellers end early incoterms 2020 6u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc in the transit cycle is common to the f and the c rules whether they are the maritime incoterms rules or the incoterms rules intended for any modes of transport 25 the f and the c rules do however differ as to whether it is the seller or buyer who contracts for or arranges the carriage of the goods beyond the place or port of delivery in the f rules itxa0is the buyer who makes such arrangements unless the parties agree otherwise in the c rules this obligation falls to the seller 26 given that a seller on any of the c rules contracts for or arranges the carriage of the goods beyond delivery the parties need to know what the destination is to which it must arrange carriageand that is the place attached to the name of the incoterms rule eg cif the port of dalian or cip the inland city of shenyang whatever that named destination is that place is not and never becomes the place of delivery risk will have transferred on shipment or on handing over the goods at the place of delivery but the contract of carriage must have been made by the seller for the named destination delivery and destination then in the c rules are necessarily not the same place v incoterms 2020 rules and the carrier 27 in the f and the c rules placing the goods for example on board the vessel or handing them over to or placing them at the disposal of the carrier marks the point at which the goods are delivered by the seller to the buyer therefore this is the point at which risk transfers from the seller to the buyer 28 given those two important consequences it becomes essential to identify who the carrier is where there is more than one carrier each carrying out a separate leg of transport for instance by road rail air or sea of course where the seller has taken the far more prudent course of making one contract of carriage with one carrier taking responsibility for the entire carriage chain in a socalled through contract of carriage the problem does not arise however where there is no such through carriage contract the goods could be handed over where the cip or cpt rules are used to a roadhaulier or rail company for onward transmission to a sea carrier the same situation may arise with exclusively maritime transport where for example the goods are first handed over to a river or feeder shortsea carrier for onward transmission to an oceanxa0carrier 29 in these situations when does the seller deliver the goods to the buyer when it hands the goods over to the first second or third carrier 30 before we answer that question a preliminary point while in most cases the carrier will be an independent third party engaged under a contract of carriage by either the seller or the incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20027 buyer depending on whether the parties have chosen a c incoterms rule or an f incoterms rule there are situations where no such independent third party is engaged at all because the seller or the buyer itself will carry the goods sold this is more likely to happen in the d rules dap dpu and ddp where the seller may use its own means of transport to carry the goods to the buyer at the delivery destination provision has therefore been made in the incoterms 2020 rules for a seller under the d rules either to contract for carriage or to arrange for carriage that is to say through its own means of transport see a4 31 the question asked at paragraph 29 above is not simply a carriage question it is an important sale question the question is not which carrier can a seller or buyer of goods damaged in transit sue under the contract of carriage the sale question is where there is more than one carrier involved in the carriage of the goods from seller to buyer at which point in the carriage string does the handing over of the goods mark the point of delivery and the transfer of risk as between seller and buyer 32 there needs to be a simple answer to this question because the relationships between the multiple carriers used and between the seller andor the buyer with those several carriers will be complex depending as they do on the terms of a number of separate contracts of carriage thus for example in any such chain of contracts of carriage one carrier such as a carrier actually performing a leg of the transit by road may well act as the sellers agent in concluding a contract of carriage with a carrier by sea 33 the incoterms 2020 rules give a clear answer to this question where the parties contract on fca in fca the relevant carrier is the carrier nominated by the buyer to whom the seller hands over the goods at the place or point agreed in the contract of sale thus even if a seller engages a road haulier to take the goods to the agreed delivery point risk would transfer not at the place and time where the seller hands the goods over to the haulier engaged by the seller but at the place and time where the goods are placed at the disposal of the carrier engaged by the buyer this is why the naming of the place or point of delivery as precisely as possible is so important in fca sales the same situation can arise in fob if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the vessel engaged by the buyer a similar answer is provided by incoterms 2020 delivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the buyers carrier 34 with the c rules the position is more complex and may well attract different solutions under different legal systems in cpt and cip the relevant carrier is likely to be regarded at any rate in some jurisdictions as the first carrier to whom the seller incoterms 2020 8u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc hands over the goods under a2 unless the parties have agreed on the point of delivery the buyer knows nothing of the contractual arrangements made between the seller and the first or subsequent carriers or indeed between that first carrier and subsequent carriers what the buyer does know however is that the goods are in transit to him or herand that transit starts as far as the buyer knows when the goods are put by the seller into the hands of the first carrier the conse quence is that risk transfers from seller to buyer at that early stage of delivery to the first carrier the same situation can arise in cfr and cif if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the agreed port of shipment if any a similar answer might be suggested in some legal systems delivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the agreed port of shipment if any 35 such a conclusion if adopted may seem harsh on the buyer risk would transfer from seller to buyer in cpt and cip sales when the goods are handed over to the first carrier the buyer does not know at that stage whether or not that first carrier is responsible for loss of or damage to the goods under the relevant carriage contract the buyer is not a party to that contract has no control over it and will not know its terms yet despite this the buyer would end up bearing the risk in the goods from the very earliest moment of handing over possibly without recovery against that first carrier 36 while the buyer would end up bearing the risk of loss of or damage to the goods at an early stage of the transport chain it would on this view however have a remedy against the seller a2a3 do not operate in a vacuum under a4 the seller must contract for the carriage of the goods from the agreed point of delivery if any at the place of delivery to the named place of destination or if agreed any point at that place even if risk has transferred to the buyer at the time the goods were handed over to the first carrier under a2a3 if that first carrier does not undertake responsibility under its contract of carriage for the through carriage of the goods to the named destina tion the seller on this view would remain liable to the buyer under a4 in essence the seller should make a contract of carriage to the destination named under the contract of sale vi rules for the contract of sale and their relationship to other contracts 37 this discussion of the role of the carrier in the delivery of the goods as between the seller and the buyer in the c and f incoterms rules raises the question what role do the incoterms rules play in the contract of carriage or indeed in any of the other contracts typically surrounding an export contract for example an insurance contract or a letter ofxa0credit incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20029 38 the short answer is that the incoterms rules do not form part of those other contracts where incorporated the incoterms rules apply to and govern only certain aspects of the contract of sale 39 this is not the same as saying however that the incoterms rules have no impact on those other contracts goods are exported and imported through a network of contracts that in an ideal world should match the one with the other thus the sale contract for example will require the tender of a transport document issued by the carrier to the sellershipper under a contract of carriage and against which the seller shipperbeneficiary might wish to be paid under a letter of credit where the three contracts match things go well where they do not problems rapidly arise 40 what the incoterms rules say for example about carriage or transport documents in a4b4 and a6b6 or what they say about insurance cover a5b5 does not bind the carrier or the insurer or any of the banks involved thus a carrier is only bound to issue a transport document as required by the contract of carriage it makes with the other party to that contract it is not bound to issue a transport document com plying with the incoterms rules likewise an insurer is bound to issue a policy to the level and in the terms agreed with the party purchasing the insurance not a policy which complies with the incoterms rules finally a bank will look only at the documentary requirements in the letter of credit if any not at the requirements of the sales contract 41 however it is very much in the interests of all the parties to the different contracts in the network to ensure that the carriage or insurance terms they have agreed with the carrier or insurer or the terms of a letter of credit comply with what the sale contract says about ancillary contracts that need to be made or documents that need to be obtained and tendered that task does not fall on the carrier the insurer or the bank none of whom are party to the contract of sale and none of whom are therefore party to or bound by the incoterms 2020 rules it is however in the sellers and buyers interest to try to ensure that the different parts of the network of contracts matchand the starting point is the sale contractand therefore where they apply the incoterms 2020 rules vii the eleven incoterms 2020 rulessea and inland waterway and any modes of transport getting it right 42 the main distinction introduced in the incoterms 2010 rules that between rules for any mode or modes of transport comprising exw fca cpt cip dap the newly named incoterms 2020 10u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc dputhe old datand ddp and rules for sea and inland waterway transport comprising fas fob cfr and cif has been retained 43 the four socalled maritime incoterms rules are intended for use where the seller places the goods on board or in fas alongside a vessel at a sea or river port it is at this point that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer when these rules are used the risk of loss of or damage to those goods is on the buyers shoulders from that port 44 the seven incoterms rules for any mode or modes of transport socalled multimodal on the other hand are intended for use where a the point at which the seller hands the goods over to or places them at the disposal of a carrier or b the point at which the carrier hands the goods over to the buyer or the point at which they are placed at the disposal of the buyer or c both points a and b are not on board or in fas alongside a vessel 45 where delivery happens and risk transfers in each of these seven incoterms rules will depend on which particular rule is used for example in cpt delivery happens at the sellers end when the goods are handed over to the carrier contracted by the seller in dap on the other hand delivery happens when the goods are placed at the buyers disposal at the named place or point of destination 46 the order in which the incoterms 2010 rules were presented has as we have said been largely retained in incoterms 2020 and it is important to underline the distinction between the two families of incoterms rules so that the right rule is used for the contract of sale depending on the means of transport used 47 one of the most frequent problems in the use of the incoterms rules is the choice of the wrong rule for the particular type ofxa0contract 48 thus for example an fob inland point for example an airport or a warehouse sale contract makes little sense what type of contract of carriage must the buyer make does the buyer owe the seller an obligation to make a contract of carriage under which the carrier is bound to take over the goods at the named inland point or at the nearest port to that point 49 again a cif named sea port sale contract where the buyer expects the goods to be brought to an inland point in the buyers country makes little sense must the seller procure a contract of carriage and insurance cover to the eventual inland destination intended by the parties or to the seaport named in the sale contract incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200211 50 gaps overlaps and unnecessary costs are likely to ariseand all this because the wrong incoterms rule has been chosen for the particular contract what makes the mismatch wrong is that insufficient regard has been given to the two most important features of the incoterms rules features which are mirrors of each other namely the port place or point of delivery and the transfer of risks 51 the reason for the frequent misuse of the wrong incoterms rule is that incoterms rules are frequently regarded exclusively as price indicators this or that is the exw fob or dap price the initials used in the incoterms rules are doubtless handy abbreviations for the formula used in the calculation of the price incoterms rules are not however exclusively or even primarily price indicators they are a list of general obligations that sellers and buyers owe each other under wellrecognised forms of sale contractand one of their main tasks is to indicate the port place or point of delivery where the risk isxa0transferred viii order within the incoterms 2020 rules 52 all the ten ab articles in each of the incoterms rules are importantbut some are more important than others 53 there has indeed been a radical shakeup in the internal order in which the ten articles within each incoterms rule have been organised in incoterms 2020 the internal order within each incoterms rule now follows this sequence a1b1 general obligations a2b2 deliverytaking delivery a3b3 transfer of risks a4b4 carriage a5b5 insurance a6b6 deliverytransport document a7b7 exportimport clearance a8b8 checkingpackagingmarking a9b9 allocation of costs a10b10 notices 54 it will be noticed that concerning the incoterms 2020 rules after recording in a1b1 the basic goodspayment obligations of the parties delivery and the transfer of risks are moved to a more prominent location namely to a2 and a3 respectively 55 the broad sequence thereafter goes ancillary contracts a4b4 and a5b5 carriage and insurance transport documents a6b6 incoterms 2020 12u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc exportimport clearance a7b7 packaging a8b8 costs a9b9 and notices a10b10 56 it is appreciated that this change in the order of the ab articles will take some timeand costto become familiar it is hoped that with delivery and risk now made more prominent traders will find it easier to identify the differences among the various incoterms rules ie the different points in time and place at which the seller delivers the goods to the buyer with risk transferring to the buyer from that time and point 57 for the first time the incoterms rules are published both in the traditional format setting out the eleven incoterms rules and in a new horizontal format setting out the ten articles within each incoterms rule under each of the headings listed above in paragraph 53 first for the seller and then for the buyer traders can therefore now far more easily see the difference for example between the place of delivery in fca and the place of delivery in dap or the items of cost which fall on a buyer in cif when compared with the items of cost which fall on a buyer in cfr it is hoped that this horizontal rep resentation of the incoterms 2020 rules will further assist traders in choosing the incoterms rule most appropriate to their commercial requirements ix differences between incoterms 2010 and 2020 58 the most important initiative behind the incoterms 2020 rules has been to focus on how the presentation could be enhanced to steer users towards the right incoterms rule for their sale contract thus a a greater emphasis in this introduction on making the right choice b a clearer explanation of the demarcation and connection between the sale contract and its ancillary contracts c upgraded guidance notes presented now as explanatory notes to each incoterms rule and d a reordering within the incoterms rules giving delivery and risk more prominence all these changes though cosmetic in appearance are in reality substantial attempts on the part of icc to assist the international trading community towards smoother export import transactions 59 apart from these general changes there are more substantive changes in the incoterms 2020 rules when compared with incoterms 2010 before looking at those changes mention must be made of a particular development in trade practice incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200213 which occurred since 2010 and which icc has decided should not lead to a change in the incoterms 2020 rules namely verified gross mass vgm 60 note on verified gross mass vgmsince 1 july 2016 regulation 2 under the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas imposed on shippers in the case of the shipment of containers the obligation either to weigh the packed container using calibrated and certified equipment or to weigh the contents of the container and add the weight of the container when empty in either case the vgm is to be recorded with the carrier a failure to comply bears the sanction under the solas convention that the container should not be loaded onto a ship see paragraph 42 msc1circ1475 9 june 2014 these weighing operations obviously incur expense and failure may lead to delay in loading as this happened after 2010 it is unsurprising that there was some pressure in the consultations leading to incoterms 2020 for a clear indication to be given as to who as between seller and buyer should bear such obligations 61 it was felt by the drafting group that obligations and costs relating to vgm were too specific and complex to warrant explicit mention in the incoterms 2020 rules 62 returning to the changes made by icc to the incoterms 2010 rules in the incoterms 2020 rules these are a bills of lading with an onboard notation and the fca incoterms rule b costs where they are listed c different levels of insurance cover in cif and cip d arranging for carriage with sellers or buyers own means of transport in fca dap dpu and ddp e change in the threeletter initials for dat to dpu f inclusion of securityrelated requirements within carriage obligations and costs g explanatory notes for users a bills of lading with an onboard notation and the fca incoterms rule 63 where goods are sold fca for carriage by sea sellers or buyers or more likely their banks where a letter of credit is in place might want a bill of lading with an onboard notation 64 however delivery under the fca rule is completed before the loading of the goods on board the vessel it is by no means certain that the seller can obtain an onboard bill of lading from the carrier that carrier is likely under its contract of carriage to be bound and entitled to issue an onboard bill of lading only once the goods are actually on board incoterms 2020 14u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc 65 to cater for this situation fca a6b6 of incoterms 2020 now provides for an additional option the buyer and the seller can agree that the buyer will instruct its carrier to issue an onboard bill of lading to the seller after the loading of the goods the seller then being obliged to tender that bill of lading to the buyer typically through the banks icc recognises that despite this somewhat unhappy union between an onboard bill of lading and fca delivery this caters for a demonstrated need in the marketplace finally it should be emphasised that even where this optional mechanism is adopted the seller is under no obligation to the buyer as to the terms of the contract ofxa0carriage 66 does it remain true to say that where containerised goods are delivered by seller to buyer by handing over to a carrier before loading onto a ship the seller is well advised to sell on fca terms rather than on fob terms the answer to that question is yes where incoterms 2020 have made a difference however is that where such a seller still wants or needs a bill of lading with an onboard notation the new additional option in the fca term a6b6 makes provision for such a document b costs where they are listed 67 in the new ordering of the articles within the incoterms 2020 rules costs now appear at a9b9 of each incoterms rule apart from that relocation however there is another change that will become obvious to users early on the various costs which fall to be allocated by various articles within the inco terms rules have traditionally appeared in different parts of each incoterms rule thus for example costs related to the obtaining of a delivery document in fob 2010 were mentioned in a8 the article under the heading delivery document but not in a6 the article under the heading allocation of costs 68 in the incoterms 2020 rules however the equivalent of a6b6 namely a9b9 now lists all the costs allocated by each particular incoterms rule a9b9 in the incoterms 2020 rules are consequently longer than a6b6 in the incoterms 2010xa0rules 69 the purpose is to provide users with a onestop list of costs so that the seller or buyer can now find in one place all the costs for which it would be responsible under that particular incoterms rule items of cost are also mentioned in their home article thus for example the costs involved in obtaining documents in fob still also appear at a6b6 as well as at a9b9 the thinking here was that users interested in discovering the specific allocation of documentary costs might be more inclined to go to the specific article dealing with delivery documents rather than to the general article listing all thexa0costs incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200215 c different levels of insurance cover in cif and cip 70 in the incoterms 2010 rules a3 of both cif and cip imposed on the seller the obligation to obtain at its own expense cargo insurance complying at least with the minimum cover as provided by clauses c of the institute cargo clauses lloyds market associationinternational underwriting association lmaiua or any similar clauses institute cargo clauses c provide cover for a number of listed risks subject to itemised exclusions institute cargo clauses a on the other hand cover all risks again subject to itemised exclusions during the consultations leading to the incoterms 2020 rules the case was made for moving from institute cargo clauses c to institute cargo clauses a thus increasing the cover obtained by the seller for the benefit of the buyer this could of course also involve an additional cost in premium the contrary case namely to stay with institute cargo clauses c was equally strongly put particularly by those involved in the maritime trade of commodities after considerable discussion within and beyond the drafting group the decision was made to provide for different minimum cover in the cif incoterms rule and in the cip incoterms rule in the first which is much more likely to be used in the maritime commodity trades the status quo has been retained with institute cargo clauses c as the default position although it is of course open to the parties to agree to higher cover in the second namely the cip incoterms rule the seller must now obtain insurance cover complying with institute cargo clauses a although it is of course again open to the parties to agree on a lower level of cover d arranging for carriage with sellers or buyers own means of transport in fca dap dpu and ddp 71 in the incoterms 2010 rules it was assumed throughout that where the goods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer they would be carried by a thirdparty carrier engaged for the purpose either by the seller or the buyer depending on which incoterms rule was used 72 it became clear in the deliberations leading to incoterms 2020 however that there were some situations where although the goods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer they could be so carried without any thirdparty carrier being engaged at all thus for example there was nothing stopping a seller on a d rule from arranging for such carriage without outsourcing that function to a third party namely by using its own means of transportation likewise with an fca purchase there was nothing to stop the buyer from using its own vehicle for the collection of the goods and for their transport to the buyers premises incoterms 2020 16u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc 73 the rules appeared not to take account of these eventualities the incoterms 2020 rules now do by expressly allowing not only for the making of a contract of carriage but also for simply arranging for the necessary carriage e change in the threeletter initials for dat to dpu 74 the only difference between dat and dap in the incoterms 2010 rules was that in dat the seller delivered the goods once unloaded from the arriving means of transport into a terminal whereas in dap the seller delivered the goods when the goods were placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport for unloading it will also be recalled that the guidance note for dat in incoterms 2010 defined the word terminal broadly to include any place whether covered orxa0not 75 icc decided to make two changes to dat and dap first the order in which the two incoterms 2020 rules are presented has been inverted and dap where delivery happens before unloading now appears before dat secondly the name of the rule dat has been changed to dpu delivered at place unloaded emphasising the reality that the place of destination could be any place and not only a terminal however if that place is not in a terminal the seller should make sure that the place where it intends to deliver the goods is a place where it is able to unload the goods f inclusion of securityrelated requirements within carriage obligations and costs 76 it will be recalled that securityrelated requirements made a rather subdued entry into the incoterms 2010 rules through a2b2 and a10b10 in each rule the incoterms 2010 rules were the first revision of the incoterms rules to come into force after securityrelated concerns became so prevalent in the early part of this century those concerns and the associated shipping practices which they have created in their wake are now much more established connected as they are to carriage requirements an express allocation of securityrelated obligations has now been added to a4 and a7 of each incoterms rule the costs incurred by these requirements are also now given a more prominent position in the costs article namely a9b9 g explanatory notes for users 77 the guidance notes appearing at the start of each incoterms rule in the 2010 version now appear as explanatory notes for users these notes explain the fundamentals of each incoterms 2020 rule such as when it should be used when risk transfers and how costs are allocated between seller and buyer the explanatory notes are intended a to help the user accurately and efficiently steer towards the appropriate incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200217 incoterms rule for a particular transaction and b to provide those deciding or advising on disputes or contracts governed by incoterms 2020 with guidance on matters which might require interpretation for guidance on more fundamental issues that cut across the incoterms 2020 rules more gener ally reference may of course also be made to the text of thisxa0introduction x caution with variants of incoterms rules 78 sometimes the parties want to alter an incoterms rule the incoterms 2020 rules do not prohibit such alteration but there are dangers in so doing in order to avoid any unwel come surprises the parties would need to make the intended effect of such alterations extremely clear in their contract thus for example if the allocation of costs in the incoterms 2020 rules is altered in the contract the parties should also clearly state whether they intend to vary the point at which delivery is made and the risk transfers to the buyer charles debattista

inventor the determination of inventorship is a legal conclusion based on facts accordingly specific details characterizing each contributors work on the project must be detailed in the patentability study request form while most if not all patent statutes around the world fail to provide a precise definition of inventor it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features ie novel andor nonobvious of the invention conception which is the key to inventorship may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice and because inventions are defined by the claims an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that she conceived additionally those claim elements must be one of the inventive novel or nonobvious elements if requested the project leader may be required to submit evidence of contribution for each person eg laboratory notebook pages or reports showing the conception of at least one inventive element of the claimed invention my colleague and i worked together on the project who is the inventor when two or more people collaborate in conceiving a claimed invention then those people are joint inventors each joint inventor must be aware of the contribution of the other and each must contribute to the formation of the solution to a problem that is the invention thus joint inventorship is the process by which people cooperate to solve a problem and in which each person makes some mental contribution to the final conception of the solution the entire inventive concept need not occur to each of the joint inventors and they need not physically work on the project together or at the same time nor do their contributions need to be the same or equal all that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application please note that merely being present during a meeting providing research support setting up experiments at the instruction of another analytical testing or simply instructing others to perform research does not by itself indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention who is responsible for identifying inventors patent counsel at mane bears the responsibility in association with preparing a patent application to identifying the inventors consequently successfully identifying inventors involves assessing the nature of contribution by each person this assessment is necessary to permit the applicant to meet its legal obligation in most if not all of the national patent offices to provide to an accurate listing of inventors on a patent application failure to provide an accurate list of inventors may in some circumstances compromise the validity and enforceability of the resulting patent inadvertently naming or omitting an inventor is generally a correctable error but intentionally naming or omitting an inventor can result in the patent being found unenforceable against alleged infringersintellectual property basics us

exclusive right for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention once granted a patent provides from a legal standpoint the right to exclude others from making using selling offering for sale or importing the claimed invention for the term of the patent which is usually 20 years from the filing date subject to the payment of maintenance fees a patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention patents are territorial and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force the granted claims in the specific country are what defines the scope of enforcement patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder permission may typically be granted in the form of a license maintenance fees vary from country to country and when payment is due the basic quid pro quo contemplated by the constitution and the congress for granting a patent monopoly is the benefit derived by the public from an invention with substantial utility the public disclosure of scientific and technical information is part of the consideration that the inventor gives the public 18 intellectual property basics us confidential november 2017 patents claims define the metes and bounds of the patentees exclusive right what defines an invention the claims not the specification provide notice of the scope of patent protection the scope of claims is determined by interpreting the language of the claims in light of the intrinsic evidence including the claims themselves the specification the relevant prior art and the prosecution history as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art neither the specification which includes the written description of the invention nor the drawings accompanying the specification can be infringed claims must first be construed without reference to an accused product before they can be applied as so construed to the accused product to determine infringement all limitations in a claim must be considered meaningful and cannot be ignored as insignificant or immaterial in determining infringement

advantages and limitations trade secrets patents trade secrets involve no registration costs patents may cost tens of thousands of dollars per jurisdiction trade secrets have immediate effect and may last indefinitely average time to obtain a patent is five years and a patent expires up to 20 years after earliest filing date trade secret protection does not require any formalities such as disclosure of the information to a government authority inventors must disclose the invention to the public without a guarantee of obtaining a patent some trade secrets are susceptible to reverse engineering exclusive rights of patents allows protection from any type of infringement or copying whether intentional or unintentional once the secret is made public anyone may have access to it and use it at will quid pro quo for a limited monopoly to exclude others is public disclosure of the invention a trade secret may be patented by another inventor but prior commercial use defense is

to annotate information on an insert eg for reasons of clarity the original preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page note 5 it is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook for example if the data set is too large the writer can also create alternative archives for the data eg an electronic database of hplc chromatographs and simply reference the corresponding file number note 6 rather than the original of an experimental material a photograph or a digitized

invention and date thereof or date of reduction to practice and test results and 3 in some instances compliance with the provisions of many contractual arrangements instructions for recording data in the laboratory notebook 1 all entries should be made in a legible and orderly manner using permanent ink preferably black make entries clear and complete that someone else could repeat the experiment 2 avoid erasures if an error is made cross it out and make the correction immediately thereafter cancellations or insertions should be initialed dated and explained by an appropriate notation 3 make sure control page is filled out prior to usage 4 complete the table of contents as you make entries in the notebook 5 state the object and results of each experiment clearly and concisely give a complete factual and self explanatory account of the progress of the work and the procedure followed reference to earlier work done by yourself or another may be accomplished by noting a previous page of the same notebook or the page and number of an earlier notebook describe and give quantities of all materials used explain all code numbers and abbreviations 6 an entry dealing with a conception invention idea must describe the thing conceived example whether it is a chemical compound a combination of a compound and a solvent etc as well as the utility for the ting conceived how it is to be used and the methods by which it is to be prepared including equivalent materials which could be used statements with regard to utility should be stated positively work toward practical implementation of an invention should start as soon as possible in a notebook 7 negative or deprecatory entries should be avoided example a reaction gives a 2 yield was expected do not state process does not work phraseology which expresses an opinion rather than a positive statement and gratuitous comments should be avoided this is not an instruction to omit the conclusion of an experiment which had less than the expected results be factual 8 each days work should whenever possible be started on a separate page with lines drawn down angularly across the unused portion of the previous page this gives legal evidence that additions were not made at a later date it is permissible as stated above to make reference to an earlier page by reciting continued from page it is extremely important that each page show the date of entry 9 each page must be signed and dated by the individual who makes the entry and does the work in addition each page must be witnessed signed and dated using the notation read and understood preferably on the same day but at least within one week the witness should not be connected with the conception should not have taken part in the experimental work performed by another but should understand the technical filed of the entry record laboratory notebook number and project on each page 10 where a conception is made by two or more individuals it need only be entered in the notebook of one but must be signed and dated by all the conceivers ideally all conceivers should sign on the same day 11 for microfilming purposes graphs charts analytical data etc must be attached to

ordinary skill in the relevant art to reproduce recorded work and to obtain at least similar results 21 general rules regarding form uf0a7 preferably the language of the laboratory notebook is english but french or spanish may be acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the mane innovation center uf0a7 the information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet dated using two digits for the day at least three letters to uniquely identify the month and four digits for the year eg 20 may 2017 or 05 nov 2017 and referenced with its company project name or number andor an internal reference specific to the researcher uf0a7 the recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the pages of the notebook respecting the full width of the pages uf0a7 the insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided as information may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning note 3 if the need for a later entry or amendment arises it is advisable to use unmarked section of the page immediately below and particularly point out the passages concerned where no such unmarked section is available one should make the entryamendment on a subsequent page and record the subsequent page number on the instant page an arrow asterisk etc can be used to precisely identify the section being amended or corrected recording data can also be carried out by means of inserting preprinted information in the notebook for example typed reports diagrams diagrams output datum of equipment of analysis photographs etc the preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of the page nor cover any information already entered on the page transparent tape or other adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface for two successive inserts the second must be affixed below the other or on two successive pages and not side by side each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both the writer and the witness each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between the insert and the support page other than the aforementioned dates and signatures no other handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted note 4 if there is a need to annotate information on an insert eg for reasons of clarity the original preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page note 5 it is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook for example if the data set is too large the writer can also create alternative archives for the data eg an electronic database of hplc chromatographs and simply reference the corresponding file number note 6 rather than the original of an experimental material a photograph or a digitized reproduction may be used such as in the case of a thinlayer chromatography plate a gel a membrane an autoradiography or a thermosensitive ticket mane laboratory notebook policy mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 6 of 10 significant blank spaces between two information entries for example successions of blank lines page breaks pages left blank or to the right of an insert must be crossed out by means of a z so that no information may be subsequently added the removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook all handwritten entries shall be made using permanent ink there is no restriction on the choice of ink colors to be used provided that the recorded information remains fully legible and comprehensible in full after black and white reproduction using a standard photocopier black or dark blue inks are recommended the use of erasable ink pencil or white correction fluid is not allowed the texts and entries must be legible any erasure must be referred to and dated both by the editor and the witness any coding of information using specific colors should be avoided if the use of colors cannot be avoided the selection of colors andor textures must be made with careful consideration of a possible need for subsequent reproduction using a standard photocopier in black and white on each page containing an entry the name of the project and laboratory notebook number must be entered in the designated location at the top of the page 22 general rules regarding substance each test experiment or analysis whether positive or negative must be recorded in the laboratory record care should be taken to ensure that the following elements are clearly and precisely stated uf0a7 the context in which the work was carried out the objectives set andor the problem to be solved the working hypotheses etc uf0a7 the experimental conditions used protocols particular parameters and material used and uf0a7 the results obtained their possible interpretation as well as any ideas reflections or comments relating thereto note 7 if a protocol has already been previously described in the same or different laboratory notebook it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry rather it is sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity ie the laboratory notebook number and pages concerned along with the name of its author all modifications changes or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described referencing scientific publications or books is permissible if identified unambiguously using a full bibliographical citation abbreviations may be used however abbreviations that are nonstandard to persons having ordinary skill in the relevant field must be defined at their first appearance further abbreviations along with their definition should also be recorded after the table of contentsindex section at the front of the laboratory notebook note 8 it is possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures and protocols abbreviations etc and then make an appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook mane laboratory notebook policy mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 7 of 10 23 required duties of author and witness each laboratory notebook must be regularly submitted to a witness review process witnesses are mane employees having the ability or background to understand the invention for example if the invention involves advanced chemical or electronic concepts the witness must possess adequate background in the relevant field if called upon later the witness must be able to testify to their own knowledge that the facts of the entry are correct however the witness must not have the status of coauthor joint researcher of the recorded information nor should the witness be able to be considered as coinventor of any invention resulting from all or part of the experimental information accordingly the

laboratory recordkeeping procedures mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 10 of 10 general instruction laboratory notebooks are the means for keeping a permanent record of the details of an individuals daytoday work in the research and development areas they provide 1 a basic reference which the individual and others can refer to at a later date 2 legal evidence with respect to the materials recorded such as conception of an invention and date thereof or date of reduction to practice and test results and 3 in some instances compliance with the provisions of many contractual arrangements instructions for recording data in the laboratory notebook 1 all entries should be made in a legible and orderly manner using permanent ink preferably black make entries clear and complete that someone else could repeat the experiment 2 avoid erasures if an error is made cross it out and make the correction immediately thereafter cancellations or insertions should be initialed dated and explained by an appropriate notation 3 make sure control page is filled out prior to usage 4 complete the table of contents as you make entries in the notebook 5 state the object and results of each experiment clearly and concisely give a complete factual and self explanatory account of the progress of the work and the procedure followed reference to earlier work done by yourself or another may be accomplished by noting a previous page of the same notebook or the page and number of an earlier notebook describe and give quantities of all materials used explain all code numbers and abbreviations 6 an entry dealing with a conception invention idea must describe the thing conceived example whether it is a chemical compound a combination of a compound and a solvent etc as well as the utility for the ting conceived how it is to be used and the methods by which it is to be prepared including equivalent materials which could be used statements with regard to utility should be stated positively work toward practical implementation of an invention should start as soon as possible in a notebook 7 negative or deprecatory entries should be avoided example a reaction gives a 2 yield was expected do not state process does not work phraseology which expresses an opinion rather than a positive statement and gratuitous comments should be avoided this is not an instruction to omit the conclusion of an experiment which had less than the expected results be factual 8 each days work should whenever possible be started on a separate page with lines drawn down angularly across the unused portion of the previous page this gives legal evidence that additions were not made at a later date it is permissible as stated above to make reference to an earlier page by reciting continued from page it is extremely important that each page show the date of entry 9 each page must be signed and dated by the individual who makes the entry and does the work in addition each page must be witnessed signed and dated using the notation read and understood preferably on the same day but at least within one week the witness should not be connected with the conception should not have taken part in the experimental work performed by another but should understand the technical filed of the entry record laboratory notebook number and project on each page 10 where a conception is made by two or more individuals it need only be entered in the notebook of one but must be signed and dated by all the conceivers ideally all conceivers should sign on the same day 11 for microfilming purposes graphs charts analytical data etc must be attached to the notebook pages with a permanent adhesive and should when unfolded be kept within the confines of the opened notebook no entries should be made on the page beneath attached sheets and nothing must be obscured leave the heading on the top and the space provided for the witnessing signature at the bottom of each page exposed inserts should be signed and dated by the person making the entry and witnessed by another to provide the best legal evidence if materials such as spectra graphs etc are not kept in the notebook they must be signed dated and identified in such a manner as to provide a reference back to the pertinent pages of the laboratory notebook itself 12 report the loss or theft of a research notebook 13 following the use of all the pages of each notebook it must be sent to the library for record maintenance make sure table of contents pages are complete after it has been recorded it will be returned to the individual an individual may retain in his possession the laboratory notebook immediately preceding the one in which entries are currently being made normally all other laboratory notebooks will be kept on file in the library or in vault storage they may then be checked out for reasonable lengths of time by authorized individuals instructions read and includedunderstood by date signaturewhat is the purpose of a confidentiality agreement a confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement abbreviated as cda or nda is used to protect confidential and proprietary information it requires that the counterparty keep the information secret prohibits the counterparty from exploiting the information for its economic advantage and establishes that all ownership rights remain with the original party when is a cda needed when mane will share confidential information with another person or entity also when someone will observe or learn about manes confidential information additionally when any of the parties mane and counterparty wish to disclose confidential information to each other what is confidential information confidential information is usually nonpublic information for which misappropriation could give a competitor a competitive advantage what are some types of confidential information formulas samples processes and knowhow are common examples others could include methods ideas concepts techniques research experimental work developments inventions whether or not patentable scientific and clinical information design details drawings diagrams engineering specifications ingredients chemical composition recipes customer orand supplier data business records financial information legal andor corporate information sales data sales analyses forecasts plans business staffing product development etc prices margins strategy equipment technical specifications incident reports complaints claims business arrangements contracts contract terms origin of products and reports which mane entity or affiliate is the contracting party of the cda the legal entity which employs the employees who will be disclosing the information to the counterparty should be the contracting entity if several mane entities are involved each should be contracting party who is responsible for managing the confidentiality agreement with the counterparty manes representative in the relationship with the counterparty is responsible for adherence to the confidentiality policy including the followup obligations this individual is likewise responsible for being familiar with the rights and obligations of the cda and ensuring that mane observes all requirements of the agreement how do i register a cda every cda whether using manes template or one received from a counterparty must be immediately registered in the central register on sharepoint in order to allocate a register id enter the reference id in the footer of the agreement and mention it in any document used to disclose confidential information including the sentence confidential information subject to the terms and conditions of contract no include reference number is the designated representative the same as the signatory no the designated representative is the individual who is most directly responsible for managing the relationship and is the contact person for notices the signatory is the individual authorized to sign the agreement and bind the company sometimes they are the same person but often they are not is it possible to review confidentiality agreements sent by the counterparty manes representative should always seek the use of manes templates however when necessary mane will consider reviewing the counterpartys cda in that case it is the responsibility of manes representative to read the entire document before submitting the document to be registered and to provide mane legal ip department their comments on the cda and all necessary information to allow a proper review mane entities concerned subject matter retroactive effect duration do i need to involve the legal ip department consultation of the legal ip department is not needed only if you use a mane template and the counterparty signs without amendment legal is not checking the proper fillin of a mane template it must be done by manes representative in the relationship under hisher responsibility in all other cases particularly including amendments proposed by the counterparty to manes cda proposal or if the counterparty submits its form you must submit for review by legal but not until the agreement is properly registered in accordance with the confidentiality policy when completing manes template how do i define the subject matter the subject matter describes the purpose of the exchange of confidential information with the counterparty it is especially important to define this properly because it i establishes what information is covered ie only information shared that pertains to the subject matter is protected under the agreement and ii limits how the other party can use the information ie use of the confidential information is restricted to activities consistent with the subject matter the subject matter must be defined precisely as much as possible in order to provide clarity on the confidential information that is to be protected example the parties intend to investigate a possible business relationship regarding manes development and proposal of fragrance compositions and delivery systems thereof for integration by customer into its own hair care products and shall commence mutual discussions relating thereto please note the protection of the confidential information disclosed between the parties is not the subject matter for ud formula disclosure cdas how can the authorized persons list be updated reorganizationxa0 the counterparty must notify mane of any reorganization that affects the authorized persons eg withdrawal change of title etcxa0 such individuals will no longer be authorized persons unless agreed in writing by mane replacementxa0 the counterparty may only replace an authorized person with another employee who is responsible for toxicological safety or regulatory affairs within the counterparty regulatory affairs department or equivalentxa0 the counterparty should issue a letter on company letterhead and the new authorized person must sign committing personally to comply with the cda in replacement of the named former authorized personxa0 the individual being replaced will no longer be an authorized person additionxa0 if the counterparty seeks to add a new authorized person such person should be an employee of the counterparty responsible for toxicological safety or regulatory affairs within the counterparty regulatory affairs department or equivalent xa0a written amendment to the cdas appendix signed by both parties is requiredxa0 the overall list needs to remain limited in number is it possible to extend the term of a cda already signed yes please use the amendment template to renew a cda in french english or spanish on sharepoint and register it like any other cda is it possible to add another party to a cda already signed yes please use the amendment template to renew a cda in french english or spanish on sharepoint and register it like any other cda what if mane already has a cda with the counterparty it must be checked to confirm i the subject matter statement ie scope is broad enough to protect the contemplated confidential exchange ii it remains active and will continue to be valid during the period needed for the particular project even if a new cda is needed it may nevertheless be necessary to state in the new contract that the old cda remains valid so it is not superseded if any doubts confer with the legal ip department is a cda needed for a facility visit the facility visitor information and confidentiality policy can be found here it must be signed without amendment by every nonmane employee who visits manes buildings what if the three standard templates on sharepoint do not fit my needs consult the legal ip department explain if there is a particular reason that customization of the template is needed mane legal maintains other specialized templates eg threeparty toll contract manufacturing audit and material transfer what happens if a cda proposal is never signed if a cda is not signed it must be mentioned on the central register through the modification of its status from xa0draftxa0 to xa0abandonedxa0 without the deletion of its registration as a wholemane confidentiality policy access to the updated templates and to the central register listing all the confidentiality agreements issued in the mane group is restricted to a limited number of persons for confidentiality reasons if in the corporatelegaliplegalconfidentiality sharepoint site you do not visualize the register and the templates it means that you have not been given access in such a case you need to contact one of the persons having access in your department the agreement templates mane templates are to be used for establishing confidentiality agreements and must never be provided to a person outside of mane without the details being fully completed and registered first templates are not intended to be

betahydrane as a neutralizing odor compound important if the molecule is marketed as a patented captive it is important to check if a patent applicationgranted has been filed in said countryies if the molecule is marketed as a registered trademark or the trademark is proposed to the customer it is important to use the signs and and to check before that if said mark has been filed andor registered in said countryies if the customer needs something like a certificate for the particular action of the captive or molecule in this case it is necessary to check that specific analysis have been performed with a specific range of use of the captive compounds if any with a specific range of use of the perfume composition comprising the captive compounds in the final product comprising with the

legal and ip departmenthttpsmosscorpemeasesammanecomlegalipippatents20useful20information how is a patent application created at mane the patenting process begins with obtaining approval for a patentability study from one of the following committees cominnov innovation valorization and transfer committee spdg00101 comsci conception development and industrialization committee spds00104 what information is necessary for initiating a patentability study the purpose of a patentability study is to assess the likelihood of obtaining a granted patent having meaningful protection thus in order to assess patentability of a new product or process the inventorscontributors must provide patent counsel with specific details of the product or process including an explanation of the technical problem being solved successful and unsuccessful experiments known prior art and how the new product or process is different from old or known products or processes after studying the provided details the new product or process is defined by one or more hypothetical claims which are then evaluated by comparing the hypothetical claims to the prior art prior art is any evidence information that the invention was already publicly known or available in whole or in part before the effective filing date of the patent application and includes publicly available information such as published patent documents scientific journal articles web pages technical data sheets etc what happens after a patentability study at the conclusion of the patentability study patent counsel will prepare a final written patentability report which shall include a description of the invention the hypothetical claims a listing of the relevant prior art documents found in the prior art search and an analysis as to the novelty and inventiveness of the hypothetical claims visvis the relevant prior art documents the report will conclude with a recommendation to proceed or not with the preparation and filing of patent application because the patenting system requires disclosure of the technical details of the invention in exchange for a chance at obtaining patent rights there is a risk of disclosure without any patent rights as such in some instances and prior to making a favorable recommendation rd may be asked to perform additional testing or experiments to enhance manes chances for obtaining a granted patent what is involved with preparing a patent application the process for preparing a patent application involves a collaboration between patent counsel and the inventors patent counsel will generally begin the process by preparing a set of claims describing the metes and bounds of the invention and then build the remaining sections of the patent application therefrom to provide the requisite antecedent basis for the claims in order to correct any errors andor provide missing or supplemental information the initial draft application must be reviewed by the inventors while rare at this stage rd may be asked to perform additional experiments but only if absolutely necessary prior to filing at the end of the reviewrevision process a final draft of the patent application must be approved by the inventors prior to filing since the draft patent application needs to be approved by the inventors another important piece of information that should accompany the invention disclosure is a listing of persons who materially contributed to the creation of the invention from the listing of contributors mane patent counsel will conduct an inquiry into the nature of each contributors involvement and make a legal determination as to whose contribution rises to the level of inventorship it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features ie novel andor nonobvious of the invention conception which is the key to inventorship may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice and because inventions are defined by the claims an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that she conceived additionally those claim elements must be one of the inventive elements to be coinventors the contributions of each person need not be equal or the same all that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application please note that being present during a meeting providing research support setting up experiments at the instruction of another or sensoryanalytical testing does not by itself indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention what parts make up a patent application since a patent application serves to provide a written description describing and enabling others to practice and use the invention the inventors must provide patent counsel with sufficient details to create the application the detailed invention disclosure provided to patent counsel will be used to create the basic parts sections of a patent application which include title abstract background summary of the invention brief description of the drawings if applicable detailed description of the invention and the claims where is the initial patent application filed the initial filing or socalled priority filing is typically performed where the invention is made what happens after a patent application is filed the filing of a patent application is not the end of the process but really the beginning of a formal examination process moreover it is necessary to make decisions regarding the filing of one or more foreign patent applications under the paris convention an international treaty created in 1883 requiring member countries to adopt certain minimum protections for industrial property the priority filing permits the applicant to file one or more corresponding patent application in additional countries within 12 months from the priority filing date under the patent cooperation treaty pct which is another international treaty concluded in 1970 a single filing of a pct application may be made with a receiving office ro in one language a pct application does not itself result in the grant of a patent since there is no such thing as an international patent instead a pct application serves to establish a filing date in all contracting states and must be followed up one or more national or regional phase applications to proceed towards grant of one or more patents the pct procedure essentially leads to a standard national or regional patent application which may be granted or rejected according to applicable law in each jurisdiction in which a patent is desired if a pct application is desired then it must be filed within 12 months from the priority filing date ie the same deadline under the paris convention however the deadline for filing national phase applications from the pct application varies from member states but is generally 30 months from the priority filing date so in essence the pct serves as a mechanism to delay the decision for filing patent applications from 12 months to about 30 months but only in the 153 member countries in each jurisdiction the claims of the patent application are evaluated for clarity novelty and inventiveness after 18 months from the earliest priority date the application publishes and thus the invention is available to the public what to expect during examination of a patent application the examination of a patent application begins with an examiner reviewing the clarity novelty and inventiveness of the claims visvis the prior art the examiner then issues an office action which in most cases includes a rejectionobjection of one or more of the pending claims an applicant is given a limited period of time eg 34 months to respond to the office action which may include arguments claim amendments andor evidence supporting the patentability of the pending claims depending on the nature of the rejectionobjection the inventors may be consulted for technical input to assist patent counsel with developing claim amendmentsrebuttal arguments to overcome the examiners rejectionsobjections ideally the inventors should also be aware of what embodiments are being utilized in manes commercial productprocess thus this collaboration between patent counsel and the inventors should provide mane the best opportunity to obtain commerciallyrelevant granted patentspatents and process confidential

intellectual property matters confidential november 2017 concluding remarks questions for more information contact us wwwmanecom jamescareymanecom 5132392254what is a patent a patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention which is a product or a process that provides in general a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem a few exemplary inventions include 1 a new process for making seamless capsules 2 a new fragrance molecule or 3 a new composition that blocks bitterness taste of high intensity sweeteners patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made used distributed or sold without the patent owners consent patent rights are usually enforced in courts that in most systems hold the authority to stop patent infringement conversely a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party what is patentable an invention must in general fulfill the following conditions to be protected by a patent 1 industrially applicable useful it must be of practical use 2 new it must show an element of novelty meaning some new characteristic that is not part of the body of existing knowledge in its particular technical field that body of existing knowledge is called prior art 3 inventive not obvious it must show an inventive step that is not obvious or routine by a person with average knowledge of the technical field the subject matter of the invention must also be accepted as patentable under the patent laws of a given county in many countries scientific theories mathematical methods plant or animal varieties discoveries of natural substances commercial methods or methods of medical treatment as opposed to medical products are not generally patentable for example abstract ideas einsteins equation emc2 laws of nature gravity or natural occurring phenomena a chemical found in nature are not patentable but specific applications of these things could be patentable how long does a patent last patent rights may last for up to 20 years if renewal or maintenance fees are paid in a timely manner which countries are covered by a patent patents are granted by national patent offices or by regional offices that carry out examination work for a group of countries for example the european patent office epo and the african intellectual property organization oapi under such regional systems an applicant requests protection for an invention in one or more countries and each country decides whether to offer patent protection within its borders the wipoadministered patent cooperation treaty pct provides for the filing of a single international patent application that has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries however in order to obtain a patent in a pct member nation a patent application must be filed and prosecuted in the pct member nation what is patent infringement patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder permission may typically be granted in the form of a license the definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention in many countries a use is required to be commercial or to have a commercial purpose to constitute patent infringement the scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent in other words the terms of the claims inform the public of what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder patents are territorial and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force what do i do if i think i have an invention do not disclose your invention to anyone

of strengthening the bond of trust necessary for the proper functioning of the mane group a vast amount of an employees personal data is necessary for the management of their career and our services within mane and we must all help to protect it for this some advice ask employees only for necessary information for business purposes and avoid processing socalled sensitive data health union activity political opinions religion ethnic origin if you must process it special obligations apply and are addressed by policy ensure confidentiality and security thus only authorized persons should have access actions on data carried out by authorized persons must be recorded know who connects to what when and to do what logical but also physical measures must be taken to ensure its conservation and confidentiality inform the employees concerned each time you process their personal data example update of administrative data training request evaluation interview form etc finally always remember that employees can request a copy of all their personal data that you hold for example copy of a pay slip statement of a timesavings account telephone records card reader statements or messages sent via professional email and that this request can also be made by exemployees in case of doubt about the legitimacy declaration retention or securing of the processing of personal data of

personal or private any email or file that has not been identified by an employee as personal will fail to be considered professional in nature and freely viewable by mane as reminded by article 34 of the mane it charter to which the mane rules of governance refer in the event where the users employment contract terminates the user shall before the user leaves the company retrieve and delete any file or personal email before the user effectively leaves in particular the user must empty the nobackup directory on the users workstation subfolder located in my documents do not delete any professional data that could be useful to the company return all documents information or material belonging to v mane fils the mailbox will be deleted the day after the users departure before final deletion of the mailbox a temporary copy of the data will be made and kept for one month before being deleted the copy of the data will be made available to the line manager by request made to the

general data protection regulation gdpr imposes the requirement that collectors and processors provide concise transparent understandable and easily accessible information in simple and clear terms to the persons concerned this transparency obligation is defined in articles 12 13 and 14 of the gdpr the methods of providing and presenting this information must be adapted to the context transparency allows those concerned know the reason for collecting the various data concerning them understand the treatment that will be made of their data ensure control of their data by facilitating the exercise of their rights so remember when you are processing personal data in the context of the activity of your service or the company to inform the persons whose data is being processed by any effective means beforehand for example by sending an email delivering an information note by hand drafting a clause in a contract this information must be prior to the collection of personal data for a new processing or when personal data already collected and processed are again processed for another purpose than that initially indicated to the data subject you will find attached a template of information note to adapt to each type of treatment and to be sent to the persons who need to be informedpd flash 13 involvement of hr and it departments in compliance with the gdpr dear all hr and it departments are those who more than any other in a company collect store and process personal data and must secure it it is up to companies to prove that these two services have brought their operating processes into compliance with the gdpr indeed they must be constantly involved in discussions around the protection of personal data regarding the hr department it may have to respond to any employees assertion of his right of access rectification or deletion of his personal data the hr department must therefore ensure that it knows where this information is stored and be able to gather it quickly in order to respond to any requests from employees it implies that the hr department knows exactly where all the personal data are held optimizes its systems to better manage this information but also are able to prove to employees that their requests regarding their data have been processed in order to achieve this it must consider all of the information generated by an employee from his job interview to his effective departure from the company recruitment medical information wage payments and travel information are particularly sensitive the it department on the other hand is responsible for ensuring the security of the personal data that the company processes and holds it must guarantee the integrity of the data provenance by minimizing the risk of data loss or hacking the measures to be taken whether digital or physical depend on the sensitivity of the data processed and the risks to which people are exposed in the event of an incident the flaws can have serious consequences for those who have entrusted personal data in the event of loss disclosure or unwanted modification of their data it department must be able to detect them quickly and resolve the incident as quickly as possibleflash dp 14 gdpr management of your customers suppliers relationship the control of the personal data of our customers prospects or suppliers constitutes a guarantee of quality and trust regarding mane this requires that specific rules are needed when you the collect and use of personal data name email telephone number postal address etc for the purposes of establishing a commercial relationship depending on the prospecting method email telephone or text message that you use the persons contacted must first have given their consent to receive your messages optin generally in b2c or not have expressed their refusal opt out usually in b2b in any case people should be able to refuse to receive further requests from you offer them this possibility when you contact them example an unsubscribe link in your emails and take these requests into account example update the list of people contacted and the list of people who objected if your operations are intended to retain your customers suppliers think about the following 3 rules the collection of certain personal data is not imperative for all commercial approaches you must justify the usefulness of all the personal data collected and processed eg fax number if never used at the time of collection inform your customers suppliers about what you will do with their data by sending them our gtc an information notice on the document intended to collect personal data or an information email by example do not forget to provide them with the address dpomanecom to contact for the exercise of their rights of access rectification opposition and erasure do not keep their data indefinitely plan the deletion of information in the event of a prolonged commercial relationship with your customers suppliers the commission nationale de linformatique et des liberts cnil as the independent french administrative regulatory body whose mission is to ensure that data privacy law is applied to the collection storage and use of personal data recommends a maximum data retention period of 3 years from the end of the commercial relationship if however you must keep certain data due to legal obligations beyond this period archive them in another database whos access is more restrictedpd flash 2 what is meant by personal data february 11 2020 a first fundamental step to understand better your rights and ensure the optimal protection of the personal data of your colleagues customers suppliers service providers external contacts trainees and any person transmitting their personal data is to define what personal data are as opposed to what can be excluded from the sphere of application of gdpr personal data are any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person but because they concern persons they must retain control over them a natural person can be identified directly eg surname and first name indirectly eg by a telephone number or license plate an identifier such as the social security number a postal or email address but also the voice or image the identification of a natural person can be carried out from a single information eg name from the crossmatching of a set of data eg a woman living at such address born on this day and member of such association however company contact details eg company company a with its postal address switchboard telephone number and a generic contact email company1emailcom are not personal datapd flash 3 what is the processing of personal data and the data controller february 19 2020 since we often receive questions about this topic it seems useful to us to specify two essential definitions about the processing of personal data and the data controller personal data processing is all operations relating to personal data regardless of the process used for example save organize store modify compare to other data transmit personal data etc different types of processing personal data is not limited to the computerized processing of files it can be a database or an excel table but also a video surveillance installation a credit card payment or biometric recognition system a smartphone application etc new processing methods appear regularly and evolve according to technological innovations computerized or not a processing of personal data can be computerized or not for example a paper document might be organized according to a filing plan or candidate application forms classified in alphabetical or chronological order are also a processing of personal data the controller is the legal person company public authority etc or natural person who determines the purposes and means of a processing defines the purpose and the method of carrying it out within mane group it is not an individual or department but the body corporate of mane group which processes personal datapd flash 4 sanctions under the gdpr february 28 2020 in 2019 mane group completed the implementation of the new gdpr rules according to cnil the data protection supervisory authority for mane group all controls and the penalties associated with their violation are now in full force and effect the old legislation provided for relatively reduced sanctions and enforcement was infrequent by refraining until the end of 2018 to sanction noncompliance with gdpr the cnil wanted to allow data controllers to gradually understand and assimilate the requirements of the gdpr adopted in 2016 this transition now complete the first major sanctions were applied by the cnil in 2019 starting with the exemplary one of 50 million euros against google and then of 500000 euros against the company futura international and of 400000 euros against sergic the maximum sanction for the mane group is 55 million euros these sanctions can be made public while man group believes the gdpr rules are in the best interests of our employees customers and partners the significant financial penalties and reputational damage which can result from violations should cause each of us to redouble our commitment to compliancepd flash 5 definitions of data protection rights march 4 2020 the persons concerned by the gdpr have rights allowing them to keep control over their personal data when they are processed by other persons legal or natural different types of rights the right to be informed to be fair

for prospecting purposes electronically the right to object people must be able to object to the reuse by the data controller of their personal data anyone has the right to object for legitimate reasons to the processing of their data unless it is necessary to meet a legal obligation the rights of access and rectification any person can access to all the information concerning him or her know the origin of this information access to the information upon which a decision concerning him or her was based obtain a copy and demand that his or her data be rectified supplemented updated or deleted right to be forgotten obligation to respond the data controller must respond to data subject requests within one month including when it has no data on the requesting person for example the data has been deleted unless the requests are manifestly abusive in particular by their quantity their repetitive or systematic nature in case of refusal of an access request it must be duly justified and must be accompanied by information on the procedures and time limits for appealspd flash 6 record of processing activities to concretely measure the impact of the gdpr on our activities it was necessary to identify precisely the processing of personal data performed by each department within mane group at headquarters and in the subsidiaries keeping a register of personal data processing

categories of personal data processed the objectives pursued by the data processing operations the persons internal or external who process this data the chain of custody of personal data in particular to identify any data transfers outside the european union in order to keep this mapping of personal data processed by the mane group up to date the participation of each department and each

flash application of gdpr regulations to an international group for an international group like mane ensuring compliance with the gdpr at the level of the whole group therefore beyond french and european establishments in the strict sense is essential in fact the penalty for a violation by a subsidiary would be set as a percentage of the revenue of the entire group and would consequently generate a major financial and image impact for mane the text of the gdpr regulation defines the fundamental concept of coresponsibility the parent company v mane fils is considered to be responsible for processing personal data and must offer the guarantee to the authorities that all of its subsidiaries which are coprocessors comply with the gdpr so that it can itself be considered compliant we must therefore ensure the effective compliance of all our european subsidiaries as they are directly subject to gdpr regulations all our subsidiaries outside the european union because these subsidiaries process personal data of european nationals eg data concerning expats contacts in outlook of european colleagues contacts and other information about employees service providers suppliers

happened realities sample preparation experiment test conditions results including unexpected results or observations document critical events to prove compliance with sops what it means result interpretation including comments on oddities potential uses whats next future plans ideas hints and tips use notebook as a repository of creativity what are the general rules regarding the form of the notebook preferably the language of the laboratory notebook is english but french or spanish may be acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the mane innovation center the information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet dated using two digits for the day at least three letters to uniquely identify the month and four digits for the year eg 20 may 2017 or 05 nov 2017 and referenced with its company project name or number andor an internal reference specific to the researcher the recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the pages of the notebook respecting the full width of the pages the insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided as information may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning is there another way to carry out datas recording data can also be carried out by means of inserting preprinted information in the notebook for example typed reports diagrams diagrams output datum of equipment of analysis photographs etc the preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of the page nor cover any information already entered on the page transparent tape or other adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface how to put successive insert into the notebook for two successive inserts the second must be affixed below the other or on two successive pages and not side by side each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both the writer and the witness each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between the insert and the support page other than the aforementioned dates and signatures no other handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted would it be possible to add information to the laboratory notebook or to make an amendment if the need for a later entry or amendment arises it is advisable to use unmarked section of the page immediately below and particularly point out the passages concerned where no such unmarked section is available one should make the entryamendment on a subsequent page and record the subsequent page number on the instant page an arrow asterisk etc can be used to precisely identify the section being amended or corrected what is the procedure to annotate an information on a insert if there is a need to annotate information on an insert eg for reasons of clarity the original preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page is it necessary to integrate every piece of data into the laboratory notebook it is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook for example if the data set is too large the writer can also create alternative archives for the data eg an electronic database of hplc chromatographs and simply reference the corresponding file number can a photograph or a digitized reproduction be used into the laboratory notebook rather than the original of an experimental material a photograph or a digitized reproduction may be used such as in the case of a thinlayer chromatography plate a gel a membrane an autoradiography or a thermosensitive ticket what other informations can be inserted into a laboratory notebook heres an example of other informations that can be inserted computergenerated data datasheet templates emails notes of discussions and conversations photographs printed graphs product labels related papers and readings can large items be kept in a separate folder if too large to fit items may be kept in a separate folder always record date and other identifying information can i leave blank spaces between two information entries significant blank spaces between two information entries for example successions of blank lines page breaks pages left blank or to the right of an insert must be crossed out by means of a z so that no information may be subsequently added the removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook how handwritten entries should be made significant blank spaces between two information entries for example successions of blank lines page breaks pages left blank or to the right of an insert must be crossed out by means of a z so that no information may be subsequently added the removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook is there a recommendation regarding the use of ink black or dark blue inks are recommended the use of erasable ink pencil or white correction fluid is not allowed the texts and entries must be legible any erasure must be referred to and dated both by the editor and the witness is the use of specific colors to code informations allowed any coding of information using specific colors should be avoided if the use of colors cannot be avoided the selection of colors andor textures must be made with careful consideration of a possible need for subsequent reproduction using a standard photocopier in black and white are all tests experiments or analysis have to be recorded inside the laboratory notebook each test experiment or analysis whether positive or negative must be recorded in the laboratory record can abbreviations be used inside the notebook abbreviations may be used however abbreviations that are nonstandard to persons having ordinary skill in the relevant field must be defined at their first appearance further abbreviations along with their definition should also be recorded after the table of contentsindex section at the front of the laboratory notebook if a protocol has already been described in a laboratory notebook is it necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry if a protocol has already been described in the same or different laboratory notebook it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry rather it is sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity all the modifications changes or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described is it possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures yes it is possible to possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures and then make an appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook what are the duties of the author of the laboratory notebook heres a list of the main duties of the author each page must be dated each page of the laboratory book as soon as it is completed must be dated and signed by the author in the space designated for this purpose any mistakes or crossedout entries as soon as they appear in the laboratory book must be dated and signed by the author do not insert any information including corrections in a corner of a page even if that page has not yet been countersigned by a witness if any error or mistake is identified the erroneous information should be clearly identified and corrected in a space immediately below the error if there is no available space or the available space is insufficient then corrections may be made on a subsequent page with an appropriate forward reference on the page bearing the erroneous information if the date on which the error was found andor corrected is different from the origin date said correction date should be properly recorded unused lines or spaces at the bottom of the pages should be crossed out using a z marking in order to certify the reality of the recording the author must have a witness sign each of the pages of his laboratory notebook within a maximum of 4 weeks after the writing of each of these pages no new information or data integration can be entered onto any page that has been already signed by a witness what are the duties of the witness regarding the laboratory notebook heres a list of the main duties of the witness read the information entered by the authorresearcher to evaluate whether the level of details is sufficient to enable its reproduction by another having ordinary skill in the relevant art cosign all taped or glued inserts the date and signature must be affixed astride the insert and its supporting page surface verify the quality of the information with regard to compliance with manes laboratory notebook policy along with laboratory recordkeeping procedures found at the front of the laboratory notebook itself how often a laboratory notebook must be certified the holderassignee of a laboratory notebook must have it certified twice a year at the time of

creativity what are the general rules regarding the form of the notebook preferably the language of the laboratory notebook is english but french or spanish may be acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the mane innovation center the information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet dated using two digits for the day at least three letters to uniquely identify the month and four digits for the year eg 20 may 2017 or 05 nov 2017 and referenced with its company project name or number andor an internal reference specific to the researcher the recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the pages of the notebook respecting the full width of the pages the insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided as information may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning is there another way to carry out datas recording data can also be carried out by means of inserting preprinted information in the notebook for example typed reports diagrams diagrams output datum of equipment of analysis photographs etc the preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of the page nor cover any information already entered on the page transparent tape or other adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface how to put successive insert into the notebook for two successive inserts the second must be affixed below the other or on two successive pages and not side by side each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both the writer and the witness each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between the insert and the support page other than the aforementioned dates and signatures no other handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted would it be possible to add information to the laboratory notebook or to make an amendment if the need for a later entry or amendment arises it is advisable to use unmarked section of the page immediately below and particularly point out the passages concerned where no such unmarked section is available one should make the entryamendment on a subsequent page and record the subsequent page number on the instant page an arrow asterisk etc can be used to precisely identify the section being amended or corrected what is the procedure to annotate an information on a insert if there is a need to annotate information on an insert eg for reasons of clarity the original preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page is it necessary to integrate every piece of data into the laboratory notebook it is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook for example if the data set is too large the writer can also create alternative archives for the data eg an electronic database of hplc chromatographs and simply reference the corresponding file number can a photograph or a digitized reproduction be used into the laboratory notebook rather than the original of an experimental material a photograph or a digitized reproduction may be used such as in the case of a thinlayer chromatography plate a gel a membrane an autoradiography or a thermosensitive ticket what other informations can be inserted into a laboratory notebook heres an example of other informations that can be inserted computergenerated data datasheet templates emails notes of discussions and conversations photographs printed graphs product labels related papers and readings can large items be kept in a separate folder if too large to fit items may be kept in a separate folder always record date and other identifying information can i leave blank spaces between two information entries significant blank spaces between two information entries for example successions of blank lines page breaks pages left blank or to the right of an insert must be crossed out by means of a z so that no information may be subsequently added the removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook how handwritten entries should be made significant blank spaces between two information entries for example successions of blank lines page breaks pages left blank or to the right of an insert must be crossed out by means of a z so that no information may be subsequently added the removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook is there a recommendation regarding the use of ink black or dark blue inks are recommended the use of erasable ink pencil or white correction fluid is not allowed the texts and entries must be legible any erasure must be referred to and dated both by the editor and the witness is the use of specific colors to code informations allowed any coding of information using specific colors should be avoided if the use of colors cannot be avoided the selection of colors andor textures must be made with careful consideration of a possible need for subsequent reproduction using a standard photocopier in black and white are all tests experiments or analysis have to be recorded inside the laboratory notebook each test experiment or analysis whether positive or negative must be recorded in the laboratory record can abbreviations be used inside the notebook abbreviations may be used however abbreviations that are nonstandard to persons having ordinary skill in the relevant field must be defined at their first appearance further abbreviations along with their definition should also be recorded after the table of contentsindex section at the front of the laboratory notebook if a protocol has already been described in a laboratory notebook is it necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry if a protocol has already been described in the same or different laboratory notebook it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry rather it is sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity all the modifications changes or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described is it possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures yes it is possible to possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures and then make an appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook what are the duties of the author of the laboratory notebook heres a list of the main duties of the author each page must be dated each page of the laboratory book as soon as it is completed must be dated and signed by the author in the space designated for this purpose any mistakes or crossedout entries as soon as they appear in the laboratory book must be dated and signed by the author do not insert any information including corrections in a corner of a page even if that page has not yet been countersigned by a witness if any error or mistake is identified the erroneous information should be clearly identified and corrected in a space immediately below the error if there is no available space or the available space is insufficient then corrections may be made on a subsequent page with an appropriate forward reference on the page bearing the erroneous information if the date on which the error was found andor corrected is different from the origin date said correction date should be properly recorded unused lines or spaces at the bottom of the pages should be crossed out using a z marking in order to certify the reality of the recording the author must have a witness sign each of the pages of his laboratory notebook within a maximum of 4 weeks after the writing of each of these pages no new information or data integration can be entered onto any page that has been already signed by a witness what are the duties of the witness regarding the laboratory notebook heres a list of the main duties of the witness read the information entered by the authorresearcher to evaluate whether the level of details is sufficient to enable its reproduction by another having ordinary skill in the relevant art cosign all taped or glued inserts the date and signature must be affixed astride the insert and its supporting page surface verify the quality of the information with regard to compliance with manes

jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters recast the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 674 and points a c and e of article 812 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 whereas 1 on 21 april 2009 the commission adopted a report on the application of council regulation ec no 442001 of 22 december 2000 on jurisdiction and the recogxad nition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 3 the report concluded that in general the operation of that regulation is satisfactory but that it is desirable to improve the application of certain of its provisions to further facilitate the free circulation of judgments and to further enhance access to justice since a number of amendments are to be made to that regulation it should in the interests of clarity be recast 2 at its meeting in brussels on 10 and 11 december 2009 the european council adopted a new multiannual programme entitled the stockholm programme an open and secure europe serving and protecting citizens 4 in the stockholm programme the european council considered that the process of abolishing all intermediate measures the exequatur should be continued during the period covered by that programme at the same time the abolition of the exequatur should also be accompanied by a series of safeguards 3 the union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom security and justice inter alia by facilitating access to justice in particular through the principle of mutual recognition of judicial and extra judicial decisions in civil matters for the gradual estabxad lishment of such an area the union is to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters having crossborder implications particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market 4 certain differences between national rules governing jurisdiction and recognition of judgments hamper the sound operation of the internal market provisions to unify the rules of conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and to ensure rapid and simple recognition and enforcement of judgments given in a member state are essential 5 such provisions fall within the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters within the meaning of article 81 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu en 20122012 official journal of the european union l 3511 1 oj c 218 2372011 p 78 2 position of the european parliament of 20 november 2012 not yet published in the official journal and decision of the council of 6 december 2012 3 oj l 12 1612001 p 1 4 oj c 115 452010 p 1 6 in order to attain the objective of free circulation of judgments in civil and commercial matters it is necessary and appropriate that the rules governing jurisxad diction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments be governed by a legal instrument of the union which is binding and directly applicable 7 on 27 september 1968 the then member states of the european communities acting under article 220 fourth indent of the treaty establishing the european economic community concluded the brussels convention on jurisxad diction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters subsequently amended by conventions on the accession to that convention of new member states 1 the 1968 brussels convention on 16 september 1988 the then member states of the european communities and certain efta states concluded the lugano convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 2 the 1988 lugano convention which is a parallel convention to the 1968 brussels convention the 1988 lugano convention became applicable to poland on 1 february 2000 8 on 22 december 2000 the council adopted regulation ec no 442001 which replaces the 1968 brussels convention with regard to the territories of the member states covered by the tfeu as between the member states except denmark by council decision 2006325ec 3 the community concluded an agreement with denmark ensuring the application of the provisions of regulation ec no 442001 in denmark the 1988 lugano convention was revised by the convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 4 signed at lugano on 30 october 2007 by the community denmark iceland norway and switzerland the 2007 lugano convention 9 the 1968 brussels convention continues to apply to the territories of the member states which fall within the territorial scope of that convention and which are excluded from this regulation pursuant to article 355 of the tfeu 10 the scope of this regulation should cover all the main civil and commercial matters apart from certain well defined matters in particular maintenance obligations which should be excluded from the scope of this reguxad lation following the adoption of council regulation ec no 42009 of 18 december 2008 on jurisdiction applicable law recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to mainxad tenance obligations 5 11 for the purposes of this regulation courts or tribunals of the member states should include courts or tribunals common to several member states such as the benelux court of justice when it exercises jurisdiction on matters falling within the scope of this regulation therefore judgments given by such courts should be recognised and enforced in accordance with this regulation 12 this regulation should not apply to arbitration nothing in this regulation should prevent the courts of a member state when seised of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have entered into an arbitration agreement from referring the parties to arbitration from staying or dismissing the proceedings or from examining whether the arbitration agreement is null and void inoperative or incapable of being performed in accordance with their national law a ruling given by a court of a member state as to whether or not an arbitration agreement is null and void inoperative or incapable of being performed should not be subject to the rules of recognition and enforcement laid down in this regulation regardless of whether the court decided on this as a principal issue or as an incidental question on the other hand where a court of a member state exercising jurisdiction under this regulation or under national law has determined that an arbitration agreement is null and void inoperative or incapable of being performed this should not preclude that courts judgment on the substance of the matter from being recognised or as the case may be enforced in accordance with this regulation this should be without prejudice to the competence of the courts of the member states to decide on the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in accordance with the convention on the recogxad nition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards done at new york on 10 june 1958 the 1958 new york convention which takes precedence over this reguxad lation this regulation should not apply to any action or ancillary proceedings relating to in particular the estabxad lishment of an arbitral tribunal the powers of arbitrators the conduct of an arbitration procedure or any other aspects of such a procedure nor to any action or judgment concerning the annulment review appeal recognition or

this regulation applies and the territory of the member states accordingly common rules of jurisxad diction should in principle apply when the defendant is domiciled in a member state 14 a defendant not domiciled in a member state should in general be subject to the national rules of jurisdiction applicable in the territory of the member state of the court seised however in order to ensure the protection of consumers and employees to safeguard the jurisdiction of the courts of the member states in situations where they have exclusive jurisdiction and to respect the autonomy of the parties certain rules of jurisdiction in this regulation should apply regardless of the defendants domicile 15 the rules of jurisdiction should be highly predictable and founded on the principle that jurisdiction is generally based on the defendants domicile jurisdiction should always be available on this ground save in a few well defined situations in which the subjectmatter of the dispute or the autonomy of the parties warrants a different connecting factor the domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction 16 in addition to the defendants domicile there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close connection between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice the existence of a close connection should ensure legal certainty and avoid the possibility of the defendant being sued in a court of a member state which he could not reasonably have foreseen this is important particularly in disputes concerning noncontractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality including defamation 17 the owner of a cultural object as defined in article 11 of council directive 937eec of 15 march 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state 1 should be able under this regulation to initiate proceedings as regards a civil claim for the recovery based on ownership of such a cultural object in the courts for the place where the cultural object is situated at the time the court is seised such proceedings should be without prejudice to proceedings initiated under directive 937eec 18 in relation to insurance consumer and employment contracts the weaker party should be protected by rules of jurisdiction more favourable to his interests than the general rules 19 the autonomy of the parties to a contract other than an insurance consumer or employment contract where only limited autonomy to determine the courts having jurisdiction is allowed should be respected subject to the exclusive grounds of jurisdiction laid down in this reguxad lation 20 where a question arises as to whether a choiceofcourt agreement in favour of a court or the courts of a member state is null and void as to its substantive validity that question should be decided in accordance with the law of the member state of the court or courts designated in the agreement including the conflictof laws rules of that member state 21 in the interests of the harmonious administration of justice it is necessary to minimise the possibility of concurrent proceedings and to ensure that irreconcilable judgments will not be given in different member states there should be a clear and effective mechanism for resolving cases of lis pendens and related actions and for obviating problems flowing from national differences as to the determination of the time when a case is regarded as pending for the purposes of this regulation that time should be defined autonomously 22 however in order to enhance the effectiveness of exclusive choiceofcourt agreements and to avoid abusive litigation tactics it is necessary to provide for an exception to the general lis pendens rule in order to deal satisfactorily with a particular situation in which concurrent proceedings may arise this is the situation where a court not designated in an exclusive choiceof court agreement has been seised of proceedings and the designated court is seised subsequently of proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties in such a case the court first seised should be required to stay its proceedings as soon as the designated court has been seised and until such time as the latter court declares that it has no jurisdiction under the exclusive choiceofcourt agreement this is to ensure that in such a situation the designated court has priority to decide on the validity of the agreement and on the extent to which the agreement applies to the dispute pending before it the designated court should be able to proceed irrespective of whether the non designated court has already decided on the stay of proceedings en 20122012 official journal of the european union l 3513 1 oj l 74 2731993 p 74 this exception should not cover situations where the parties have entered into conflicting exclusive choiceof court agreements or where a court designated in an exclusive choiceofcourt agreement has been seised first in such cases the general lis pendens rule of this regulation should apply 23 this regulation should provide for a flexible mechanism allowing the courts of the member states to take into account proceedings pending before the courts of third states considering in particular whether a judgment of a third state will be capable of recognition and enforcement in the member state concerned under the law of that member state and the proper administration of justice 24 when taking into account the proper administration of justice the court of the member state concerned should assess all the circumstances of the case before it such circumstances may include connections between the facts of the case and the parties and the third state concerned the stage to which the proceedings in the third state have progressed by the time proceedings are initiated in the court of the member state and whether or not the court of the third state can be expected to give a judgment within a reasonable time that assessment may also include consideration of the question whether the court of the third state has exclusive jurisdiction in the particular case in circumxad stances where a court of a member state would have exclusive jurisdiction 25 the notion of provisional including protective measures should include for example protective orders aimed at obtaining information or preserving evidence as referred to in articles 6 and 7 of directive 200448ec of the european parliament and of the council of 29 april 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights 1 it should not include measures which are not of a protective nature such as measures ordering the hearing of a witness this should be without prejudice to the application of council regulation ec no 12062001 of 28 may 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters 2 26 mutual trust in the administration of justice in the union justifies the principle that judgments given in a member state should be recognised in all member states without the need for any special procedure in addition the aim of making crossborder litigation less timeconsuming and costly justifies the abolition of the declaration of enforceability prior to enforcement in the member state addressed as a result a judgment given by the courts of a member state should be treated as if it had been given in the member state addressed 27 for the purposes of the free circulation of judgments a judgment given in a member state should be recognised and enforced in another member state even if it is given against a person not domiciled in a member state 28 where a judgment contains a measure or order which is not known in the law of the member state addressed that measure or order including any right indicated therein should to the extent possible be adapted to one which under the law of that member state has equivalent effects attached to it and pursues similar aims how and by whom the adaptation is to be carried out should be determined by each member state 29 the direct enforcement in the member state addressed of a judgment given in another member state without a declaration of enforceability should not jeopardise respect for the rights of the defence therefore the person against whom enforcement is sought should be able to apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers one of the grounds for refusal of recognition to be present this should include the ground that he had not had the opportunity to arrange for his defence where the judgment was given in default of appearance in a civil action linked to criminal proceedings it should also include the grounds which could be invoked on the basis of an agreement between the member state addressed and a third state concluded pursuant to article 59 of the 1968 brussels convention 30 a party challenging the enforcement of a judgment given in another member state should to the extent possible and in accordance with the legal system of the member state addressed be able to invoke in the same procedure in addition to the grounds for refusal provided for in this regulation the grounds for refusal available under national law and within the timelimits laid down in that law the recognition of a judgment should however be refused only if one or more of the grounds for refusal provided for in this regulation are present en l 3514 official journal of the european union 20122012 1 oj l 157 3042004 p 45 2 oj l 174 2762001 p 1 31 pending a challenge to the enforcement of a judgment it should be possible for the courts in the member state addressed during the entire proceedings relating to such a challenge including any appeal to allow the enforcement to proceed subject to a limitation of the enforcement or to the provision of security 32 in order to inform the person against whom enforcement is sought of the enforcement of a judgment given in another member state the certificate established under this regulation if necessary accompanied by the judgment should be served on that person in reasonable time before the first enforcement measure in this context the first enforcement measure should mean the first enforcement measure after such service 33 where provisional including protective measures are ordered by a court having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter their free circulation should be ensured under this regulation however provisional including protective measures which were ordered by such a court without the defendant being summoned to appear should not be recognised and enforced under this regulation unless the judgment containing the measure is served on the defendant prior to enforcement this should not preclude the recognition and enforcement of such measures under national law where provisional including protective measures are ordered by a court of a member state not having jurisxad diction as to the substance of the matter the effect of such measures should be confined under this regulation to the territory of that member state 34 continuity between the 1968 brussels convention reguxad lation ec no 442001 and this regulation should be ensured and transitional provisions should be laid down to that end the same need for continuity applies as regards the interpretation by the court of justice of the european union of the 1968 brussels convention and of the regulations replacing it 35 respect for international commitments entered into by the member states means that this regulation should not affect conventions relating to specific matters to which the member states are parties 36 without prejudice to the obligations of the member states under the treaties this regulation should not affect the application of bilateral conventions and agreements between a third state and a member state concluded before the date of entry into force of reguxad lation ec no 442001 which concern matters governed by this regulation 37 in order to ensure that the certificates to be used in connection with the recognition or enforcement of judgxad ments authentic instruments and court settlements under this regulation are kept uptodate the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the tfeu should be delegated to the commission in respect of amendments to annexes i and ii to this regulation it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level the commission when preparing and drawing up delegated acts should ensure a simultaneous timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council 38 this regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union in particular the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial guaranteed in article 47 of the charter 39 since the objective of this regulation cannot be suffixad ciently achieved by the member states and can be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union teu in accordance with the principle of proporxad tionality as set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 40 the united kingdom and ireland in accordance with article 3 of the protocol on the position of the united kingdom and ireland annexed to the teu and to the then treaty establishing the european community took part in the adoption and application of regulation ec no 442001 in accordance with article

directive 9546ec general data protection regulation text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 16 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1 having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions 2 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 whereas 1 the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right article 81 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the charter and article 161 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her 2 the principles of and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data should whatever their nationality or residence respect their fundamental rights and freedoms in particular their right to the protection of personal data this regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom security and justice and of an economic union to economic and social progress to the strengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market and to the wellbeing of natural persons 3 directive 9546ec of the european parliament and of the council 4 seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow of personal data between member states 452016 l 1191

and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data oj l 281 23111995 p 31 4 the processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights in accordance with the principle of proportionality this regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the charter as enshrined in the treaties in particular the respect for private and family life home and communications the protection of personal data freedom of thought conscience and religion freedom of expression and information freedom to conduct a business the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and cultural religious and linguistic diversity 5 the economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial increase in crossborder flows of personal data the exchange of personal data between public and private actors including natural persons associations and undertakings across the union has increased national authorities in the member states are being called upon by union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another member state 6 rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data the scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally technology has transformed both the economy and social life and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data 7 those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the union backed by strong enforcement given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market natural persons should have control of their own personal data legal and practical certainty for natural persons economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced 8 where this regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by member state law member states may as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply incorporate elements of this regulation into their national law 9 the objectives and principles of directive 9546ec remain sound but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the union legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons in particular with regard to online activity differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons in particular the right to the protection of personal data with regard to the processing of personal data in the member states may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the union those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the union distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under union law such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of directive 9546ec 10 in order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the union the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all member states consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the union regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller member states should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this regulation in conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing directive 9546ec member states have several sectorspecific laws in areas that need more specific provisions this regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for member states to specify its rules including for the processing of special categories of personal data sensitive data to that extent this regulation does not exclude member state law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful 452016 l 1192 official journal of the european union en 11 effective protection of personal data throughout the union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the member states 12 article 162 tfeu mandates the european parliament and the council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free movement of personal data 13 in order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market a regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators including micro small and mediumsized enterprises and to provide natural persons in all member states with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data and equivalent sanctions in all member states as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different member states the proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data to take account of the specific situation of micro small and mediumsized enterprises this regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to recordkeeping in addition the union institutions and bodies and member states and their supervisory authorities are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro small and mediumsized enterprises in the application of this regulation the notion of micro small and mediumsized enterprises should draw from article 2 of the annex to commission recommendation 2003361ec 1 14 the protection afforded by this regulation should apply to natural persons whatever their nationality or place of residence in relation to the processing of their personal data this regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons including the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person 15 in order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention the protection of natural persons should be technoloxad gically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used the protection of natural persons should apply to the processing of personal data by automated means as well as to manual processing if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system files or sets of files as well as their cover pages which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this regulation 16 this regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of union law such as activities concerning national security this regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the member states when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the union 17 regulation ec no 452001 of the european parliament and of the council 2 applies to the processing of personal data by the union institutions bodies offices and agencies regulation ec no 452001 and other union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this regulation and applied in the light of this regulation in order to provide a strong and coherent data protection framework in the union the necessary adaptations of regulation ec no 452001 should follow after the adoption of this regulation in order to allow application at the same time as this regulation 18 this regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or

detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data is the subject of a specific union legal act this regulation should not therefore apply to processing activities for those purposes however personal data processed by public authorities under this regulation should when used for those purposes be governed by a more specific union legal act namely directive eu 2016680 of the european parliament and of the council 1 member states may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of directive eu 2016680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes in so far as it is within the scope of union law falls within the scope of this regulation with regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this regulation member states should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this regulation such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes taking into account the constitutional organisational and administrative structure of the respective member state when the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this regulation this regulation should provide for the possibility for member states under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security this is relevant for instance in the framework of antimoney laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories 20 while this regulation applies inter alia to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities union or member state law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities the competence of the supervisory authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks including decision making it should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within the judicial system of the member state which should in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this regulation enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this regulation and handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations 21 this regulation is without prejudice to the application of directive 200031ec of the european parliament and of the council 2 in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in articles 12 to 15 of that directive that directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between member states 22 any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the union should be carried out in accordance with this regulation regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the union establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements the legal form of such arrangements whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality is not the determining factor in that respect 452016 l 1194 official journal of the european union en 1 directive eu 2016680 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the

1772000 p 1 23 in order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this regulation the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the union by a controller or a processor not established in the union should be subject to this regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment in order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the union it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more member states in the union whereas the mere accessibility of the controllers processors or an intermediarys website in the union of an email address or of other contact details or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established is insufficient to ascertain such intention factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more member states with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the union may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the union 24 the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the union by a controller or processor not established in the union should also be subject to this regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the union in order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences behaviours and attitudes 25 where member state law applies by virtue of public international law this regulation should also apply to a controller not established in the union such as in a member states diplomatic mission or consular post 26 the principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person to determine whether a natural person is identifiable account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used such as singling out either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly to ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person account should be taken of all objective factors such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments the principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable this regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information including for statistical or research purposes 27 this regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons member states may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons 28 the application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and processors to meet their dataprotection obligations the explicit introduction of pseudonyxad misation in this regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection 29 in order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data measures of pseudonymixad sation should whilst allowing general analysis be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure for the processing concerned that this regulation is implemented and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately the controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller 452016 l 1195 official journal of the european union en 30 natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices applications tools and protocols such as internet protocol addresses cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags this may leave traces which in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them 31 public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of their official mission such as tax and customs authorities financial investigation units independent adminisxad trative authorities or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest in accordance with union or member state law the requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems the processing of personal data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable dataprotection rules according to the purposes of the processing 32 consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given specific informed and unambiguous indication of the data subjects agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her such as by a written statement including by electronic means or an oral statement this could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subjects acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data silence preticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes when the processing has multiple purposes consent should be given for all of them if the data subjects consent is to be given following a request by electronic means the request must be clear concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided 33 it is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection therefore data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose 34 genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question in particular chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid dna or ribonucleic acid rna analysis or from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained 35 personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject this includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for or the provision of health care services as referred to in directive 201124eu of the european parliament and of the council 1 to that natural person a number symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural person for health purposes information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance including from genetic data and biological samples and any information on for example a disease disability disease risk medical history clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its source for example from a physician or other health professional a hospital a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test 36 the main establishment of a controller in the union should be the place of its central administration in the union unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the union in which case that other establishment should be considered to be 452016 l 1196 official journal of the european union en 1 directive 201124eu of the european parliament and of the council of 9 march 2011 on the application of patients rights in crossborder healthcare oj l 88 442011 p 45 the main establishment the main establishment of a controller in the union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements that criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location the presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not in themselves constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment the main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the union or if it has no central administration in the union the place where the main processing activities take place in the union in cases involving both the controller and the processor the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the member state where the controller has its main establishment but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this regulation in any case the supervisory authorities of the member state or member states where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of undertakings except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking 37 a group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings whereby the controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other undertakings by virtue for example of ownership financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules implemented an undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded together with those undertakings as a group of undertakings 38 children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data as they may be less aware of the risks consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data such specific protection should in particular apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child the consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child 39 any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair it should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected used consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed the principle of transparency requires that any information and communixad cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand and that clear and plain language be used that principle concerns in particular information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed natural persons should be made aware of risks rules safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing in particular the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data the personal data should be adequate relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed this requires in particular ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means in order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing 40 in order for processing to be lawful personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law either in this regulation or in other union or 452016 l 1197 official journal of the european union en member state law as referred to in this regulation including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract 41 where this regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the member state concerned however such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it in accordance with the caselaw of the court of justice of the european union the court of justice and the european court of human rights 42 where processing is based on the data subjects consent the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation in particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which consent is given in accordance with council directive 9313eec 1 a declaration of consent pre formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms for consent to be informed the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment 43 in order to ensure that consent is freely given consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case or if the performance of a contract including the provision of a service is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance 44 processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a contract 45 where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority the processing should have a basis in union or member state law this regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing a law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient it should also be for union or member state law to determine the purpose of processing furthermore that law could specify the general conditions of this regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing establish specifications for determining the controller the type of personal data which are subject to the processing the data subjects concerned the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed the purpose limitations the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing it should also be for union or member state law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law or where it is in the public interest to do so including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services by private law such as a professional association 46 the processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person processing of personal data 452016 l 1198 official journal of the european union en 1 council directive 9313eec of 5 april 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts oj l 95 2141993 p 29 based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies in particular in situations of natural and manmade disasters 47 the legitimate interests of a controller including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed or of a third party may provide a legal basis for processing provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller at any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks the processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest 48 controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes including the processing of clients or employees personal data the general principles for the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected 49 the processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security ie the ability of a network or an information system to resist at a given level of confidence accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability authenticity integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data and the security of the related services offered by or accessible via those networks and systems by public authorities by computer emergency response teams certs computer security incident response teams csirts by providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned this could for example include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping denial of service attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems 50 the processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected in such a case no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller union or member state law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations the legal basis provided by union or member state law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing in order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected the controller after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing should take into account inter alia any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing the context in which the personal data have been collected in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their 452016 l 1199 official journal of the european union en further use the nature of the personal data the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on union or member state law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard in particular important objectives of general public interest the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes in any case the application of the principles set out in this regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including the right to object should be ensured indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller however such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal professional or other binding obligation of secrecy 51 personal data which are by their nature particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin whereby the use of the term racial origin in this regulation does not imply an acceptance by the union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races the processing of photographs should not systematixad cally be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person such personal data should not be processed unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this regulation taking into account that member states law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller in addition to the specific requirements for such processing the general principles and other rules of this regulation should apply in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided inter alia where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms 52 derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when provided for in union or member state law and subject to suitable safeguards so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights where it is in the public interest to do so in particular processing personal data in the field of employment law social protection law including pensions and for health security monitoring and alert purposes the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health such a derogation may be made for health purposes including public health and the management of healthcare services especially in order to ensure the quality and costeffectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health insurance system or for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes a derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment exercise or defence of legal claims whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or outofcourt procedure 53 special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for healthrelated purposes only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole in particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems including processing by the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control management information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system and ensuring continuity of health or social care and crossborder healthcare or health security monitoring and alert purposes or for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes based on union or member state law which has to meet an objective of public interest as well as for studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health therefore this regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data concerning health in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain healthrelated purposes 452016 l 11910 official journal of the european union en by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy union or member state law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons member states should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions including limitations with regard to the processing of genetic data biometric data or data concerning health however this should not hamper the free flow of personal data within the union when those conditions apply to crossborder processing of such data 54 the processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health without consent of the data subject such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons in that context public health should be interpreted as defined in regulation ec no 13382008 of the european parliament and of the council 1 namely all elements related to health namely health status including morbidity and disability the determinants having an effect on that health status health care needs resources allocated to health care the provision of and universal access to health care as well as health care expenditure and financing and the causes of mortality such processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies 55 moreover the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims laid down by constitutional law or by international public law of officially recognised religious associations is carried out on grounds of public interest 56 where in the course of electoral activities the operation of the democratic system in a member state requires that political parties compile personal data on peoples political opinions the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public interest provided that appropriate safeguards are established 57 if the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this regulation however the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights identification should include the digital identification of a data subject for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials used by the data subject to login to the online service offered by the data controller 58 the principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise easily accessible and easy to understand and that clear and plain language and additionally where appropriate visualisation be used such information could be provided in electronic form for example when addressed to the public through a website this is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected such as in the case of online advertising given that children merit specific protection any information and communication where processing is addressed to a child should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand 59 modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subjects rights under this regulation including mechanisms to request and if applicable obtain free of charge in particular access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object the controller should also provide means for requests to be made electronically especially where personal data are processed by electronic means the controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests 452016 l 11911 official journal of the european union en 1 regulation ec no 13382008 of the european parliament and of the council of 16 december 2008 on community statistics on public health and health and safety at work oj l 354 31122008 p 70 60 the principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes the controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed furthermore the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling where the personal data are collected from the data subject the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences where he or she does not provide such data that information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing where the icons are presented electronically they should be machinereadable 61 the information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data subject or where the personal data are obtained from another source within a reasonable period depending on the circumstances of the case where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used general information should be provided 62 however it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already possesses the information where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproporxad tionate effort the latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in that regard the number of data subjects the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration 63 a data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals in order to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing this includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health for example the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses examination results assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided every data subject should therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed where possible the period for which the personal data are processed the recipients of the personal data the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and at least when based on profiling the consequences of such processing where possible the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data that right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software however the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject the controller should be able to request that before the information is delivered the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request relates 64 the controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access in particular in the context of online services and online identifiers a controller should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests 65 a data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a right to be forgotten where the retention of such data infringes this regulation or union or member state law to which the controller is subject in particular a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data concerning him or her or where the processing of his or her personal data does not otherwise comply with this regulation that right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given 452016 l 11912 official journal of the european union en his or her consent as a child and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing and later wants to remove such personal data especially on the internet the data subject should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child however the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information for compliance with a legal obligation for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes or for the establishment exercise or defence of legal claims 66 to strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any links to or copies or replications of those personal data in doing so that controller should take reasonable steps taking into account available technology and the means available to the controller including technical measures to inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subjects request 67 methods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could include inter alia temporarily moving the selected data to another processing system making the selected personal data unavailable to users or temporarily removing published data from a website in automated filing systems the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing operations and cannot be changed the fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system 68 to further strengthen the control over his or her own data where the processing of personal data is carried out by automated means the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured commonly used machinereadable and interoperable format and to transmit it to another controller data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability that right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract it should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract by its very nature that right should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties it should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller the data subjects right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible where in a certain set of personal data more than one data subject is concerned the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this regulation furthermore that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this regulation and should in particular not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract where technically feasible the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another 69 where personal data might lawfully be processed because processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party a data subject should nevertheless be entitled to object to the processing of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation it should be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject 70 where personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing the data subject should have the right to object to such processing including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing whether with regard to initial or further processing at any time and free of charge that right should be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other information 452016 l 11913 official journal of the european union en 71 the data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision which may include a measure evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her such as automatic

humanitarian purposes those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in the charter and in the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 74 the responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controllers behalf should be established in particular the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this regulation including the effectiveness of the measures those measures should take into account the nature scope context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons 452016 l 11914 official journal of the european union en 75 the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons of varying likelihood and severity may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical material or nonmaterial damage in particular where the processing may give rise to discrimination identity theft or fraud financial loss damage to the reputation loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation or any other significant economic or social disadvantage where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin political opinions religion or philosophical beliefs trade union

in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning performance at work economic situation health personal preferences or interests reliability or behaviour location or movements in order to create or use personal profiles where personal data of vulnerable natural persons in particular of children are processed or where processing involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of data subjects 76 the likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by reference to the nature scope context and purposes of the processing risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk or a high risk 77 guidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing their assessment in terms of origin nature likelihood and severity and the identification of best practices to mitigate the risk could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of conduct approved certifications guidelines provided by the board or indications provided by a data protection officer the board may also issue guidelines on processing operations that are considered to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address such risk 78 the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements of this regulation are met in order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this regulation the controller should adopt internal policies and implement measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default such measures could consist inter alia of minimising the processing of personal data pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible transparency with regard to the functions and processing of personal data enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing enabling the controller to create and improve security features when developing designing selecting and using applications services and products that are based on the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task producers of the products services and applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products services and applications and with due regard to the state of the art to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations the principles of data protection by design and by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders 79 the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility and liability of controllers and processors also in relation to the monitoring by and measures of supervisory authorities requires a clear allocation of the responsibilities under this regulation including where a controller determines the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller 80 where a controller or a processor not established in the union is processing personal data of data subjects who are in the union whose processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required to such data subjects in the union or to the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the union the controller or the processor should designate a representative unless the processing is occasional does not include processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons taking into account the 452016 l 11915 official journal of the european union en nature context scope and purposes of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body the repxad resentative should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed by any supervisory authority the representative should be explicitly designated by a written mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf with regard to its obligations under this regulation the designation of such a repxad resentative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller or of the processor under this regulation such a representative should perform its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller or processor including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard to any action taken to ensure compliance with this regulation the designated representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance by the controller or processor 81 to ensure compliance with the requirements of this regulation in respect of the processing to be carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller when entrusting a processor with processing activities the controller should use only processors providing sufficient guarantees in particular in terms of expert knowledge reliability and resources to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of this regulation including for the security of processing the adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller the carryingout of processing by a processor should be governed by a contract or other legal act under union or member state law binding the processor to the controller setting out the subject matter and duration of the processing the nature and purposes of the processing the type of personal data and categories of data subjects taking into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the context of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject the controller and processor may choose to use an individual contract or standard contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by the commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency mechanism and then adopted by the commission after the completion of the processing on behalf of the controller the processor should at the choice of the controller return or delete the personal data unless there is a requirement to store the personal data under union or member state law to which the processor is subject 82 in order to demonstrate compliance with this regulation the controller or processor should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility each controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory authority and make those records on request available to it so that it might serve for monitoring those processing operations 83 in order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this regulation the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks such as encryption those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security including confidentiality taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected in assessing data security risk consideration should be given to the risks that are presented by personal data processing such as accidental or unlawful destruction loss alteration unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical material or nonmaterial damage 84 in order to enhance compliance with this regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons the controller should be responsible for the carryingout of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate in particular the origin nature particularity and severity of that risk the outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with this regulation where a dataprotection impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation a consultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing 85 a personal data breach may if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner result in physical material or nonmaterial damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights discrimination identity theft or fraud financial loss unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation damage to reputation loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned therefore as soon as the controller becomes 452016 l 11916 official journal of the european union en aware that a personal data breach has occurred the controller should notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and where feasible not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it unless the controller is able to demonstrate in accordance with the accountability principle that the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons where such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information may be provided in phases without undue further delay 86 the controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach without undue delay where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to take the necessary precautions the communication should describe the nature of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation with the supervisory authority respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant authorities such as lawenforcement authorities for example the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication 87 it should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subject the fact that the notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this regulation 88 in setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breach including whether or not personal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection measures effectively limiting the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse moreover such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of lawenforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investixad gation of the circumstances of a personal data breach 89 directive 9546ec provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data to the supervisory authorities while that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection of personal data such indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue of their nature scope context and purposes such types of processing operations may be those which in particular involve using new technologies or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out before by the controller or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial processing 90 in such cases a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity of the high risk taking into account the nature scope context and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk that impact assessment should include in particular the measures safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for mitigating that risk ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating compliance with this regulation 91 this should in particular apply to largescale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount of personal data at regional national or supranational level and which could affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high risk for example on account of their sensitivity where in accordance with the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects in particular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights a data 452016 l 11917 official journal of the european union en protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special categories of personal data biometric data or data on criminal convictions and offences or related security measures a data protection impact assessment is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale especially when using opticelectronic devices or for any other operations where the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects in particular because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service or a contract or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale the processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual physician other health care professional or lawyer in such cases a data protection impact assessment should not be mandatory 92 there are circumstances under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection impact assessment to be broader than a single project for example where public authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely used horizontal activity 93 in the context of the adoption of the member state law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question member states may deem it necessary to carry out such assessment prior to the processing activities 94 where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would in the absence of safeguards security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the risk result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation the supervisory authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities such high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent and frequency of processing which may result also in a realisation of damage or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person the supervisory authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified period however the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this regulation including the power to prohibit processing operations as part of that consultation process the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons 95 the processor should assist the controller where necessary and upon request in ensuring compliance with the obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments and from prior consultation of the supervisory authority 96 a consultation of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of personal data in order to ensure compliance of the intended processing with this regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data subject 97 where the processing is carried out by a public authority except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity where in the private sector processing is carried out by a controller whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of the data subjects on a large scale or where the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal convictions and offences a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor internal compliance with this regulation in the private sector the core activities of a controller relate to its primary activities and do not relate to the processing of personal data as ancillary activities the necessary level of expert knowledge should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations carried out 452016 l 11918 official journal of the european union en and the protection required for the personal data processed by the controller or the processor such data protection officers whether or not they are an employee of the controller should be in a position to perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner 98 associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged to draw up codes of conduct within the limits of this regulation so as to facilitate the effective application of this regulation taking account of the specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and the specific needs of micro small and medium enterprises in particular such codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons 99 when drawing up a code of conduct or when amending or extending such a code associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders including data subjects where feasible and have regard to submissions received and views expressed in response to such consultations 100 in order to enhance transparency and compliance with this regulation the establishment of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services 101 flows of personal data to and from countries outside the union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion of international trade and international cooperation the increase in such flows has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal data however when personal data are transferred from the union to controllers processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the union by this regulation should not be undermined including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to controllers processors in the same or another third country or international organisation in any event transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with this regulation a transfer could take place only if subject to the other provisions of this regulation the conditions laid down in the provisions of this regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by the controller or processor 102 this regulation is without prejudice to international agreements concluded between the union and third countries regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for the data subjects member states may conclude international agreements which involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or inxad ternational organisations as far as such agreements do not affect this regulation or any other provisions of union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental rights of the data subjects 103 the commission may decide with effect for the entire union that a third country a territory or specified sector within a third country or an international organisation offers an adequate level of data protection thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the union as regards the third country or international organisation which is considered to provide such level of protection in such cases transfers of personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place without the need to obtain any further authorisxad ation the commission may also decide having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to the third country or international organisation to revoke such a decision 104 in line with the fundamental values on which the union is founded in particular the protection of human rights the commission should in its assessment of the third country or of a territory or specified sector within a third country take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law access to justice as well as inxad ternational human rights norms and standards and its general and sectoral law including legislation concerning public security defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law the adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria such as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and legislation in force in the third country the third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level of 452016 l 11919 official journal of the european union en protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the union in particular where personal data are processed in one or several specific sectors in particular the third country should ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the member states data protection authorities and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress 105 apart from the international commitments the third country or international organisation has entered into the commission should take account of obligations arising from the third countrys or international organisations participation in multilateral or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal data as well as the implementation of such obligations in particular the third countrys accession to the council of europe convention of 28 january 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to the automatic processing of personal data and its additional protocol should be taken into account the commission should consult the board when assessing the level of protection in third countries or international organisations 106 the commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third country a territory or specified sector within a third country or an international organisation and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted on the basis of article 256 or article 264 of directive 9546ec in its adequacy decisions the commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their functioning that periodic review should be conducted in consultation with the third country or international organisation in question and take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation for the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews the commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the european parliament and of the council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources the commission should evaluate within a reasonable time the functioning of the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the committee within the meaning of regulation eu no 1822011 of the european parliament and of the council 1 as established under this regulation to the european parliament and to the council 107 the commission may recognise that a third country a territory or a specified sector within a third country or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection consequently the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation should be prohibited unless the requirements in this regulation relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards including binding corporate rules and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled in that case provision should be made for consultations between the commission and such third countries or international organisations the commission should in a timely manner inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it in order to remedy the situation 108 in the absence of an adequacy decision the controller or processor should take measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the data subject such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules standard data protection clauses adopted by the commission standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the union including the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies including to obtain effective adminisxad trative or judicial redress and to claim compensation in the union or in a third country they should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing the principles of data protection by design and by default transfers may also be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties or functions including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements such as a memorandum of understanding providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects authorisation by the competent supervisory authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative arrangements that are not legally binding 109 the possibility for the controller or processor to use standard dataprotection clauses adopted by the commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or processors neither from including the 452016 l 11920 official journal of the european union en 1 regulation eu no 1822011 of the european parliament and of the council of 16 february 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by member states of the commissions exercise of implementing powers oj l 55 2822011 p 13 standard dataprotection clauses in a wider contract such as a contract between the processor and another processor nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not contradict directly or indirectly the standard contractual clauses adopted by the commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects controllers and processors should be encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that supplement standard protection clauses 110 a group of undertakings or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity should be able to make use of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers from the union to organisations within the same group of undertakings or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity provided that such corporate rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate safeguards for transfers or categories of transfers of personal data 111 provisions should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where the data subject has given his or her explicit consent where the transfer is occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim regardless of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any outofcourt procedure including procedures before regulatory bodies provision should also be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public interest laid down by union or member state law so require or where the transfer is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the public or persons having a legitimate interest in the latter case such a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the data contained in the register and when the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest the transfer should be made only at the request of those persons or if they are to be the recipients taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject 112 those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary for important reasons of public interest for example in cases of international data exchange between competition authorities tax or customs administrations between financial supervisory authorities between services competent for social security matters or for public health for example in the case of contact tracing for contagious diseases or in order to reduce andor eliminate doping in sport a transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the data subjects or another persons vital interests including physical integrity or life if the data subject is incapable of giving consent in the absence of an adequacy decision union or member state law may for important reasons of public interest expressly set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country or an international organisation member states should notify such provisions to the commission any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the geneva conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts could be considered to be necessary for an important reason of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject 113 transfers which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number of data subjects could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller when those interests are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer the controller should give particular consideraxad tion to the nature of the personal data the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations as well as the situation in the country of origin the third country and the country of final destination and should provide suitable safeguards to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data such transfers should be possible only in residual cases where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes the legitimate expectations of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into conxad sideration the controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject about the transfer 114 in any case where the commission has taken no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country the controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data in the union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards 452016 l 11921 official journal of the european union en 115 some third countries adopt laws regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the member states this may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data and which are not based on an international agreement such as a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third country and the union or a member state the extraterritorial application of those laws regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the union by this regulation transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this regulation for a transfer to third countries are met this may be the case inter alia where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in union or member state law to which the controller is subject 116 when personal data moves across borders outside the union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure of that information at the same time supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their borders their efforts to work together in the crossborder context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers inconsistent legal regimes and practical obstacles like resource constraints therefore there is a need to promote closer cooperation among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information and carry out investigations with their international counterparts for the purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data the commission and the supervisory authorities should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise of their powers with competent authorities in third countries based on reciprocity and in accordance with this regulation 117 the establishment of supervisory authorities in member states empowered to perform their tasks and exercise their powers with complete independence is an essential component of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data member states should be able to establish more than one supervisory authority to reflect their constitutional organisational and administrative structure 118 the independence of supervisory authorities should not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review 119 where a member state establishes several supervisory authorities it should establish by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory authorities in the consistency mechanism that member state should in particular designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism to ensure swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities the board and the commission 120 each supervisory authority should be provided with the financial and human resources premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of their tasks including those related to mutual assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the union each supervisory authority should have a separate public annual budget which may be part of the overall state or national budget 121 the general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should be laid down by law in each member state and should in particular provide that those members are to be appointed by means of a transparent procedure either by the parliament government or the head of state of the member state on the basis of a proposal from the government a member of the government the parliament or a chamber of the parliament or by an independent body entrusted under member state law in order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority the member or members should act with integrity refrain from any action that is incompatible with their duties and should not during their term of office engage in any incompatible occupation whether gainful or not the supervisory authority should have its own staff chosen by the supervisory authority or an independent body established by member state law which should be subject to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority 122 each supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own member state to exercise the powers and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance with this regulation this should cover in particular the 452016 l 11922 official journal of the european union en processing in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its own member state the processing of personal data carried out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest processing affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller or processor not established in the union when targeting data subjects residing on its territory this should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject conducting investigations on the application of this regulation and promoting public awareness of the risks rules safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data 123 the supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this regulation and contribute to its consistent application throughout the union in order to protect natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the internal market for that purpose the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the commission without the need for any agreement between member states on the provision of mutual assistance or on such cooperation 124 where the processing of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the union and the controller or processor is established in more than one member state or where processing taking place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one member state the supervisory authority for the main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment of the controller or processor should act as lead authority it should cooperate with the other authorities concerned because the controller or processor has an establishment on the territory of their member state because data subjects residing on their territory are substantially affected or because a complaint has been lodged with them also where a data subject not residing in that member state has lodged a complaint the supervisory authority with which such complaint has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned within its tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this regulation the board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question substantially affects data subjects in more than one member state and on what constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection 125 the lead authority should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the powers conferred on it in accordance with this regulation in its capacity as lead authority the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate the supervisory authorities concerned in the decisionmaking process where the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged 126 the decision should be agreed jointly by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller or processor and be binding on the controller and processor the controller or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards the processing activities in the union 127 each supervisory authority not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one member state but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing carried out in a single member state and involves only data subjects in that single member state for example where the subject matter concerns the processing of employees personal data in the specific employment context of a member state in such cases the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory authority without delay about the matter after being informed the lead supervisory authority should decide whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory authorities concerned onestopshop mechanism or whether the supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level when deciding whether it will handle the case the lead supervisory authority should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller or processor in the member state of the supervisory authority which informed it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision visvis the controller or processor where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case the supervisory authority which informed it should have the 452016 l 11923 official journal of the european union en possibility to submit a draft for a decision of which the lead supervisory authority should take utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that onestopshop mechanism 128 the rules on the lead supervisory authority and the onestopshop mechanism should not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies in the public interest in such cases the only supervisory authority competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this regulation should be the supervisory authority of the member state where the public authority or private body is established 129 in order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this regulation throughout the union the supervisory authorities should have in each member state the same tasks and effective powers including powers of investigation corrective powers and sanctions and authorisation and advisory powers in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under member state law to bring infringements of this regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings such powers should also include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing member states may specify other tasks related to the protection of personal data under this regulation the powers of supervisory authorities should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set out in union and member state law impartially fairly and within a reasonable time in particular each measure should be appropriate necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this regulation taking into account the circumstances of each individual case respect the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific requirements in member state procedural law such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation each legally binding measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing be clear and unambiguous indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure the date of issue of the measure bear the signature of the head or a member of the supervisory authority authorised by him or her give the reasons for the measure and refer to the right of an effective remedy this should not preclude additional requirements pursuant to member state procedural law the adoption of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the member state of the supervisory authority that adopted the decision 130 where the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory authority the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this regulation in such cases the lead supervisory authority should when taking measures intended to produce legal effects including the imposition of administrative fines take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any investigation on the territory of its own member state in liaison with the competent supervisory authority 131 where another supervisory authority should act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor in the member state where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially affect data subjects in other member states the supervisory authority receiving a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail possible infringements of this regulation should seek an amicable settlement with the controller and if this proves unsuccessful exercise its full range of powers this should include specific processing carried out in the territory of the member state of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects on the territory of that member state processing that is carried out in the context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects in the territory of the member state of the supervisory authority or processing that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under member state law 132 awarenessraising activities by supervisory authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed at controllers and processors including micro small and mediumsized enterprises as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context 452016 l 11924 official journal of the european union en 133 the supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and provide mutual assistance so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement of this regulation in the internal market a supervisory authority requesting mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request by the other supervisory authority 134 each supervisory authority should where appropriate participate in joint operations with other supervisory authorities the requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond to the request within a specified time period 135 in order to ensure the consistent application of this regulation throughout the union a consistency mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established that mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several member states it should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned or the commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency mechanism that mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the treaties 136 in applying the consistency mechanism the board should within a determined period of time issue an opinion if a majority of its members so decides or if so requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the commission the board should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are disputes between supervisory authorities for that purpose it should issue in principle by a twothirds majority of its members legally binding decisions in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory authorities in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case in particular whether there is an infringement of this regulation 137 there may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded a supervisory authority should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three months 138 the application of such mechanism should be a condition for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce legal effects by a supervisory authority in those cases where its application is mandatory in other cases of cross border relevance the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering the consistency mechanism 139 in order to promote the consistent application of this regulation the board should be set up as an independent body of the union to fulfil its objectives the board should have legal personality the board should be represented by its chair it should replace the working party on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data established by directive 9546ec it should consist of the head of a supervisory authority of each member state and the european data protection supervisor or their respective representatives the commission should participate in the boards activities without voting rights and the european data protection supervisor should have specific voting rights the board should contribute to the consistent application of this regulation throughout the union including by advising the commission in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international organisations and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout the union the board should act independently when performing its tasks 140 the board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the european data protection supervisor the staff of the european data protection supervisor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the board by this regulation should perform its tasks exclusively under the instructions of and report to the chair of the board 141 every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority in particular in the member state of his or her habitual residence and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance 452016 l 11925 official journal of the european union en with article 47 of the charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this regulation are infringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject the investixad gation following a complaint should be carried out subject to judicial review to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case the supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period if the case requires further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority intermediate information should be given to the data subject in order to facilitate the submission of complaints each supervisory authority should take measures such as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically without excluding other means of communication 142 where a data subject considers that his or her rights under this regulation are infringed he or she should have the right to mandate a notforprofit body organisation or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a member state has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with a supervisory authority exercise the right to a judicial remedy on behalf of data subjects or if provided for in member state law exercise the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects a member state may provide for such a body organisation or association to have the right to lodge a complaint in that member state independently of a data subjects mandate and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data which infringes this regulation that body organisation or association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subjects behalf indepenxad dently of the data subjects mandate 143 any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of the board before the court of justice under the conditions provided for in article 263 tfeu as addressees of such decisions the supervisory authorities concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being notified of them in accordance with article 263 tfeu where decisions of the board are of direct and individual concern to a controller processor or complainant the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the board in accordance with article 263 tfeu without prejudice to this right under article 263 tfeu each natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints however the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities which are not legally binding such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the member state where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that member states procedural law those courts should exercise full jurisdiction which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them where a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a supervisory authority the complainant may bring proceedings before the courts in the same member state in the context of judicial remedies relating to the application of this regulation national courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment may or in the case provided for in article 267 tfeu must request the court of justice to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of union law including this regulation furthermore where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision of the board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision of the board is at issue that national court does not have the power to declare the boards decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the court of justice in accordance with article 267 tfeu as interpreted by the court of justice where it considers the decision invalid however a national court may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the board at the request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action for annulment of that decision in particular if it was directly and individually concerned by that decision but had not done so within the period laid down in article 263 tfeu 144 where a court seized of proceedings against a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that proceedings concerning the same processing such as the same subject matter as regards processing by the same controller or processor or the same cause of action are brought before a competent court in another member state it should contact that court in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings if related proceedings are pending before a court in another member state any court other than the court first 452016 l 11926 official journal of the european union en seized may stay its proceedings or may on request of one of the parties decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if that court has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consolixad dation of such related proceedings proceedings are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings 145 for proceedings against a controller or processor the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before the courts of the member states where the controller or processor has an establishment or where the data subject resides unless the controller is a public authority of a member state acting in the exercise of its public powers 146 the controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this regulation the controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage the concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the caselaw of the court of justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this regulation this is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in union or member state law processing that infringes this regulation also includes processing that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this regulation and member state law specifying rules of this regulation data subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing each controller or processor should be held liable for the entire damage however where they are joined to the same judicial proceedings in accordance with member state law compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing provided that full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage is ensured any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors involved in the same processing 147 where specific rules on jurisdiction are contained in this regulation in particular as regards proceedings seeking a judicial remedy including compensation against a controller or processor general jurisdiction rules such as those of regulation eu no 12152012 of the european parliament and of the council 1 should not prejudice the application of such specific rules 148 in order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this regulation penalties including administrative fines should be imposed for any infringement of this regulation in addition to or instead of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this regulation in a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person a reprimand may be issued instead of a fine due regard should however be given to the nature gravity and duration of the infringement the intentional character of the infringement actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered degree of responsibility or any relevant previous infringements the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating factor the imposition of penalties including administrative fines should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the general principles of union law and the charter including effective judicial protection and due process 149 member states should be able to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this regulation including for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within the limits of this regulation those criminal penalties may also allow for the deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this regulation however the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national rules and of administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis in idem as interpreted by the court of justice 150 in order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements of this regulation each supervisory authority should have the power to impose administrative fines this regulation should indicate 452016 l 11927 official journal of the european union en 1 regulation eu no 12152012 of the european parliament and of the council of 12 december 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters oj l 351 20122012 p 1 infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines which should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual case taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation with due regard in particular to the nature gravity and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations under this regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with articles 101 and 102 tfeu for those purposes where administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not an undertaking the supervisory authority should take account of the general level of income in the member state as well as the economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the fine the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines it should be for the member states to determine whether and to which extent public authorities should be subject to adminisxad trative fines imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this regulation 151 the legal systems of denmark and estonia do not allow for administrative fines as set out in this regulation the rules on administrative fines may be applied in such a manner that in denmark the fine is imposed by competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in estonia the fine is imposed by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure provided that such an application of the rules in those member states has an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities therefore the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by the supervisory authority initiating the fine in any event the fines imposed should be effective proportionate and dissuasive 152 where this regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in other cases for example in cases of serious infringements of this regulation member states should implement a system which provides for effective proportionate and dissuasive penalties the nature of such penalties criminal or adminisxad trative should be determined by member state law 153 member states law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information including journalistic academic artistic and or literary expression with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation the processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes or for the purposes of academic artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this regulation if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information as enshrined in article 11 of the charter this should apply in particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in news archives and press libraries therefore member states should adopt legislative measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose of balancing those fundamental rights member states should adopt such exemptions and derogations on general principles the rights of the data subject the controller and the processor the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations the independent supervisory authorities cooperation and consistency and specific dataprocessing situations where such exemptions or derogations differ from one member state to another the law of the member state to which the controller is subject should apply in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom such as journalism broadly 154 this regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when applying this regulation public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest personal data in documents held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by union or member state law to which the public authority or public body is subject such laws should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation the reference to public authorities and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered by member state law on public access to documents directive 200398ec of the european parliament and of the council 1 leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the 452016 l 11928 official journal of the european union en 1 directive 200398ec of the european parliament and of the council of 17 november 2003 on the reuse of public sector information oj l 345 31122003 p 90 processing of personal data under the provisions of union and member state law and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set out in this regulation in particular that directive should not apply to documents to which access is excluded or restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal data and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain personal data the reuse of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible with the law concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data 155 member state law or collective agreements including works agreements may provide for specific rules on the processing of employees personal data in the employment context in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee the purposes of the recruitment the performance of the contract of employment including discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements management planning and organisation of work equality and diversity in the workplace health and safety at work and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment on an individual or collective basis of rights and benefits related to employment and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship 156 the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant to this regulation those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in order to ensure in particular the principle of data minimisation the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer permit the identification of data subjects provided that appropriate safeguards exist such as for instance pseudonymisation of the data member states should provide for appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes member states should be authorised to provide under specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and rights to rectification to erasure to be forgotten to restriction of processing to data portability and to object when processing personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes the conditions and safeguards in question may entail specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical and organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles the processing of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant legislation such as on clinical trials 157 by coupling information from registries researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease cancer and depression on the basis of registries research results can be enhanced as they draw on a larger population within social science research on the basis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the longterm correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions research results obtained through registries provide solid highquality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation and implementation of knowledgebased policy improve the quality of life for a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services in order to facilitate scientific research personal data can be processed for scientific research purposes subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out in union or member state law 158 where personal data are processed for archiving purposes this regulation should also apply to that processing bearing in mind that this regulation should not apply to deceased persons public authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest should be services which pursuant to union or member state law have a legal obligation to acquire preserve appraise arrange describe communicate promote disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public interest member states should also be authorised to provide for the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes for example with a view to providing specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes genocide crimes against humanity in particular the holocaust or war crimes 452016 l 11929 official journal of the european union en 159 where personal data are processed for scientific research purposes this regulation should also apply to that processing for the purposes of this regulation the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development and demonstration fundamental research applied research and privately funded research in addition it should take into account the unions objective under article 1791 tfeu of achieving a european research area scientific research purposes should also include studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health to meet the specificities of processing personal data for scientific research purposes specific conditions should apply in particular as regards the publication or otherwise disclosure of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes if the result of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for further measures in the interest of the data subject the general rules of this regulation should apply in view of those measures 160 where personal data are processed for historical research purposes this regulation should also apply to that processing this should also include historical research and research for genealogical purposes bearing in mind that this regulation should not apply to deceased persons 161 for the purpose of consenting to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials the relevant provisions of regulation eu no 5362014 of the european parliament and of the council 1 should apply 162 where personal data are processed for statistical purposes this regulation should apply to that processing union or member state law should within the limits of this regulation determine statistical content control of access specifications for the processing of personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality statistical purposes mean any operation of collection and the processing of personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical results those statistical results may further be used for different purposes including a scientific research purpose the statistical purpose implies that the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data but aggregate data and that this result or the personal data are not used in support of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person 163 the confidential information which the union and national statistical authorities collect for the production of official european and official national statistics should be protected european statistics should be developed produced and disseminated in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in article 3382 tfeu while national statistics should also comply with member state law regulation ec no 2232009 of the european parliament and of the council 2 provides further specifications on statistical confidentiality for european statistics 164 as regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller or processor access to personal data and access to their premises member states may adopt by law within the limits of this regulation specific rules in order to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations in so far as necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with an obligation of professional secrecy this is without prejudice to existing member state obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required by union law 165 this regulation respects and does not prejudice the status under existing constitutional law of churches and religious associations or communities in the member states as recognised in article 17 tfeu 166 in order to fulfil the objectives of this regulation

consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level the commission when preparing and drawingup delegated acts should ensure a simultaneous timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council 167 in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation implementing powers should be conferred on the commission when provided for by this regulation those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation eu no 1822011 in that context the commission should consider specific measures for micro

an international organisation does not ensure an adequate level of protection and imperative grounds of urgency so require 170 since the objective of this regulation namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of natural persons and the free flow of personal data throughout the union cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can rather by reason of the scale or effects of the action be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union teu in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 171 directive 9546ec should be repealed by this regulation processing already under way on the date of application of this regulation should be brought into conformity with this regulation within the period of two years after which this regulation enters into force where processing is based on consent pursuant to directive 9546ec it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the conditions of this regulation so as to allow the controller to continue such processing after the date of application of this regulation commission decisions adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on directive 9546ec remain in force until amended replaced or repealed 172 the european data protection supervisor was consulted in accordance with

enforcement of intellectual property rights including the assembling of public and privatesector representatives as a european observatory on infringements of intellectual property rights text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 114 and the first paragraph of article 118 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 whereas 1 the economic wellbeing of the union relies on sustained creativity and innovation therefore measures for their effective protection are indispensable in ensuring its future prosperity 2 intellectual property rights are vital business assets that help to ensure that creators and innovators get a fair return for their work and that their investment in research and new ideas is protected 3 a sound harmonised and progressive approach to intelxad lectual property rights is fundamental in the endeavour to fulfil the ambitions of the europe 2020 strategy including a digital agenda for europe 4 the constant increase in infringements of intellectual property rights constitutes a genuine threat not only to the union economy but also in many cases to the health and safety of union consumers therefore effective immediate and coordinated action at national european and global levels is needed to successfully combat this phenomenon 5 in the context of the overall intellectual property rights strategy envisaged by the council resolution of 25 september 2008 on a comprehensive european anticounterfeiting and antipiracy plan 3 the council called on the commission to set up a european observatory on counterfeiting and piracy the commission therefore formed a network of experts from the public and the private sectors and described the tasks of that network in its communication entitled enhancing the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market the name of the european observatory on counterfeiting and piracy should be changed to the european observatory on infringements of intellectual property rights the observatory en 1652012 official journal of the european union l 1291 1 oj c 376 22122011 p 62 2 position of the european parliament of 14 february 2012 not yet published in the official journal and decision of the council of 22 march 2012 not yet published in the official journal 3 oj c 253 4102008 p 1 6 that communication stated that the observatory should serve as the central resource for gathering monitoring and reporting information and data related to all infringements of intellectual property rights it should be used as a platform for cooperation between represenxad tatives from national authorities and stakeholders to exchange ideas and expertise on best practices and make recommendations to policymakers for joint enforcement strategies the communication specified that the observatory would be hosted and managed by the services of the commission 7 in its resolution of 1 march 2010 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market 1 the council invited the commission the member states and industry to provide the observatory with available reliable and comparable data on counterfeiting and piracy and to jointly develop and agree in the context of the observatory on plans to collect further information the council also invited the observatory to publish each year a comprehensive annual report covering the scope scale and principal characteristics of counterfeiting and piracy as well as its impact on the internal market that annual report should be prepared using the relevant information provided in that regard by the authorities of the member states the commission and the private sector within the limits of data protection law the council also recognised the importance of developing new competitive business models enlarging the legal offer of cultural and creative content and at the same time preventing and combating infringements of intellectual property rights as necessary means for fostering economic growth employment and cultural diversity 8 in its conclusions of 25 may 2010 on the future revision of the trade mark system in the european union 2 the council called on the commission to establish a legal basis for the involvement of the office for harmonxad ization in the internal market trade marks and designs the office in enforcementrelated activities including the fight against counterfeiting in particular through fostering its cooperation with the national trade mark offices and the observatory in that respect directive 200448ec of the european parliament and of the council of 29 april 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights 3 provides inter alia for certain measures to promote cooperation including the exchange of information among member states and between member states and the commission 9 in its recommendation of 26 march 2009 on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the internet 4 the european parliament recommended that the council preserve full and safe access to the internet while encouraging privatepublic cooperation in enhancing law enforcement cooperation 10 in its resolution of 22 september 2010 on enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internal market 5 the european parliament called on the member states and the commission to extend the cooperation between the office and national intellectual property offices so as to include the fight against infringements of intellectual property rights 11 in its resolution of 12 may 2011 on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries 6 the european parliament urged the commission to take into account the specific problems encountered by small and mediumsized enterprises when it comes to asserting their intellectual property rights and to promote best practice and effective methods to respect those rights 12 in its resolution of 6 july 2011 on a comprehensive approach on personal data protection in the european union 7 the european parliament called on the commission to ensure full harmonisation and legal certainty providing a uniform and high level of protection of individuals in all circumstances 13 in view of the range of tasks assigned to the observatory a solution is needed to ensure an adequate and sustainable infrastructure for the fulfilment of its tasks 14 council regulation ec no 2072009 of 26 february 2009 on the community trade mark 8 provides for administrative cooperation between the office and the courts or authorities of the member states and the exchange of publications between the office and the central industrial property offices of the member states on that basis the office has established cooperation with national offices that are active in the field of protection of intellectual property rights consequently the office already possesses to a considerable extent the necessary experience and expertise to provide an adequate and sustainable infrastructure in the field of the observatorys tasks 15 the office is therefore well placed to be entrusted with carrying out those tasks 16 those tasks should relate to all intellectual property rights covered by directive 200448ec since in many cases infringing acts affect a bundle of intellectual property rights furthermore data and the exchange of best practices are needed on the entire abovementioned range of intellectual property rights in order to obtain a complete picture of the situation and to enable comprexad hensive strategies to be devised with a view to reducing infringements of intellectual property rights en l 1292 official journal of

measures laid down by directive 200448ec thus the office should provide services to national authorities or operators which affect in particular the homogenous implementation of the directive and which are likely to facilitate its applixad cation the offices tasks should therefore be considered as closely linked to the subject matter of acts approxixad mating the laws regulations and administrative provisions of the member states 18 assembled by the office the observatory should become a centre of excellence on information and data relating to infringements of intellectual property rights by benexad fiting from the offices expertise experience and resources 19 the office should offer a forum that brings together public authorities and the private sector ensuring the collection analysis and dissemination of relevant objective comparable and reliable data regarding the value of intellectual property rights and infringements of those rights identifying and promoting best practices and strategies to enforce intellectual property rights and raising public awareness of the impact of infringements of intellectual property rights furthermore the office should fulfil additional tasks such as improving the understanding of the value of intellectual property rights fostering the exchange of information on new competitive business models which enlarge the legal offer of cultural and creative content enhancing the expertise of persons involved in the enforcement of intelxad lectual property rights by appropriate training measures increasing knowledge of techniques to prevent counterxad feiting and improving cooperation with third countries and international organisations the commission should be associated with the activities undertaken by the office under this regulation 20 the office should thus facilitate and support the activities of national authorities the private sector and the union institutions relating to the enforcement of intellectual property rights and in particular their activities in the fight against infringements of those rights the exercise by the office of its powers under this regulation does not prevent member states from exercising their comxad petences the offices tasks and activities under this regulation do not extend to participation in individual operations or investigations carried out by the competent authorities 21 in order to fulfil those tasks in the most efficient manner the office should consult and cooperate with other authxad orities at national european and where appropriate international levels create synergies with the activities carried out by such authorities and avoid any duplication of measures 22 the office should implement the tasks and activities relating to the enforcement of intellectual property rights by making use of its own budgetary means 23 with regard to representatives of the private sector the office should when assembling the observatory in the context of its activities involve a representative selection of the economic sectors including the creative industries most concerned by or most experienced in the fight against infringements of intellectual property rights in particular representatives of right holders including authors and other creators as well as internet intermediaries also a proper representation of consumers and of small and mediumsized enterprises should be ensured 24 the information obligations imposed by this regulation on the member states and on the private sector should not create unnecessary administrative burdens and should endeavour to avoid duplication as regards data already provided by member states and privatesector represenxad tatives to union institutions under existing union reporting requirements 25 since the objective of this regulation namely to entrust the office with tasks related to the enforcement of intelxad lectual property rights cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore by reason of its effect be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective have adopted this

european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty establishing the european commu nity and in particular article 61c and the second indent of article 675 thereof having regard to the proposal from the commission having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1 acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 251 of the treaty 2 whereas 1 the community has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom security and justice for the progressive establishment of such an area the community is to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters with a crossborder impact to the extent necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market 2 according to article 65 point b of the treaty these measures are to include those promoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in the member states concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction 3 the european council meeting in tampere on 15 and 16 october 1999 endorsed the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and other decisions of judicial authorities as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in civil matters and invited the council and the commission to adopt a programme of measures to implement that principle 4 on 30 november 2000 the council adopted a joint commission and council programme of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters 3 the pro gramme identifies measures relating to the harmonisation of conflictoflaw rules as those facilitating the mutual recognition of judgments 5 the hague programme 4 adopted by the european council on 5 november 2004 called for work to be pursued actively on the conflictoflaw rules regarding contractual obligations rome i 6 the proper functioning of the internal market creates a need in order to improve the predictability of the outcome of litigation certainty as to the law applicable and the free movement of judgments for the conflictoflaw rules in the member states to designate the same national law irrespective of the country of the court in which an action is brought 7 the substantive scope and the provisions of this regulation should be consistent with council regulation ec no 44 2001 of 22 december 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 5 brussels i and regulation ec no 8642007 of the european parliament and of the council of 11 july 2007 on the law applicable to non contractual obligations rome ii 6 8 family relationships should cover parentage marriage affinity and collateral relatives the reference in article 12 to relationships having comparable effects to marriage and other family relationships should be interpreted in accordance with the law of the member state in which the court is seised 9 obligations under bills of exchange cheques and promis sory notes and other negotiable instruments should also cover bills of lading to the extent that the obligations under the bill of lading arise out of its negotiable character 10 obligations arising out of dealings prior to the conclusion of the contract are covered by article 12 of regulation ec no 8642007 such obligations should therefore be excluded from the scope of this regulation 11 the parties freedom to choose the applicable law should be one of the cornerstones of the system of conflictoflaw rules in matters of contractual obligations 12 an agreement between the parties to confer on one or more courts or tribunals of a member state exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes under the contract should be one of the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a choice of law has been clearly demonstrated 13 this regulation does not preclude parties from incorporat ing by reference into their contract a nonstate body of law or an international convention l 1776 en official journal of the european union 472008 1 oj c 318 23122006 p 56 2 opinion of the european parliament of 29 november 2007 not yet published in the official journal and council decision of 5 june 2008 3

appropriate legal instrument rules of substantive contract law including standard terms and conditions such instrument may provide that the parties may choose to apply those rules 15 where a choice of law is made and all other elements relevant to the situation are located in a country other than the country whose law has been chosen the choice of law should not prejudice the application of provisions of the law of that country which cannot be derogated from by agreement this rule should apply whether or not the choice of law was accompanied by a choice of court or tribunal whereas no substantial change is intended as compared with article 33 of the 1980 convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations 1 the rome convention the wording of this regulation is aligned as far as possible with article 14 of regulation ec no 864 2007 16 to contribute to the general objective of this regulation legal certainty in the european judicial area the conflictof law rules should be highly foreseeable the courts should however retain a degree of discretion to determine the law that is most closely connected to the situation 17 as far as the applicable law in the absence of choice is concerned the concept of provision of services and sale of goods should be interpreted in the same way as when applying article 5 of regulation ec no 442001 in so far as sale of goods and provision of services are covered by that regulation although franchise and distribution contracts are contracts for services they are the subject of specific rules 18 as far as the applicable law in the absence of choice is concerned multilateral systems should be those in which trading is conducted such as regulated markets and multilateral trading facilities as referred to in article 4 of directive 200439ec of the european parliament and of the council of 21 april 2004 on markets in financial instruments 2 regardless of whether or not they rely on a central counterparty 19 where there has been no choice of law the applicable law should be determined in accordance with the rule specified for the particular type of contract where the contract cannot be categorised as being one of the specified types or where its elements fall within more than one of the specified types it should be governed by the law of the country where the party required to effect the characteristic performance of the contract has his habitual residence in the case of a contract consisting of a bundle of rights and obligations capable of being categorised as falling within more than one of the specified types of contract the characteristic performance of the contract should be determined having regard to its centre of gravity 20 where the contract is manifestly more closely connected with a country other than that indicated in article 41 or 2 an escape clause should provide that the law of that other country is to apply in order to determine that country account should be taken inter alia of whether the contract in question has a very close relationship with another contract or contracts 21 in the absence of choice where the applicable law cannot be determined either on the basis of the fact that the contract can be categorised as one of the specified types or as being the law of the country of habitual residence of the party required to effect the characteristic performance of the contract the contract should be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected in order to determine that country account should be taken inter alia of whether the contract in question has a very close relationship with another contract or contracts 22 as regards the interpretation of contracts for the carriage of goods no change in substance is intended with respect to article 44 third sentence of the rome convention consequently singlevoyage charter parties and other contracts the main purpose of which is the carriage of goods should be treated as contracts for the carriage of goods for the purposes of this regulation the term consignor should refer to any person who enters into a contract of carriage with the carrier and the term the carrier should refer to the party to the contract who undertakes to carry the goods whether or not he performs the carriage himself 23 as regards contracts concluded with parties regarded as being weaker those parties should be protected by conflict oflaw rules that are more favourable to their interests than the general rules 24 with more specific reference to consumer contracts the conflictoflaw rule should make it possible to cut the cost of settling disputes concerning what are commonly relatively small claims and to take account of the development of distanceselling techniques consistency with regulation ec no 442001 requires both that there be a reference to the concept of directed activity as a condition for applying the consumer protection rule and that the concept be interpreted harmoniously in regulation ec no 442001 and this regulation bearing in mind that a joint declaration by the council and the commission on article 15 of regulation ec no 442001 states that for article 151c to be applicable it is not sufficient for an undertaking to target its activities at the member state of the consumers residence or at a number of member states including that member state a contract must also be concluded within the framework of its activities the declaration also states that the mere fact that an internet site is accessible is not sufficient for article 15 to be applicable although a factor will be that this internet site solicits the conclusion of distance contracts and that a contract has actually been concluded at a distance by 472008 en official journal of the european union l 1777 1 oj c 334 30122005 p 1 2 oj l 145 3042004 p 1 directive as last amended by directive 200810ec oj l 76 1932008 p 33 whatever means in this respect the language or currency which a website uses does not constitute a relevant factor 25 consumers should be protected by such rules of the country of their habitual residence that cannot be derogated from by agreement provided that the consumer contract has been concluded as a result of the professional pursuing his commercial or professional activities in that particular country the same protection should be guaranteed if the professional while not pursuing his commercial or professional activities in the country where the consumer has his habitual residence directs his activities by any means to that country or to several countries including that country and the contract is concluded as a result of such activities 26 for the purposes of this regulation financial services such as investment services and activities and ancillary services provided by a professional to a consumer as referred to in sections a and b of annex i to directive 200439ec and contracts for the sale of units in collective investment undertakings whether or not covered by council directive 85611eec of 20 december 1985 on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ucits 1 should be subject to article 6 of this regulation consequently when a reference is made to terms and conditions governing the issuance or offer to the public of transferable securities or to the subscription and redemption of units in collective investment undertakings that reference should include all aspects binding the issuer or the offeror to the consumer but should not include those aspects involving the provision of financial services 27 various exceptions should be made to the general conflict oflaw rule for consumer contracts under one such exception the general rule should not apply to contracts relating to rights in rem in immovable property or tenancies of such property unless the contract relates to the right to use immovable property on a timeshare basis within the meaning of directive 9447ec of the european parliament and of the council of 26 october 1994 on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis 2 28 it is important to ensure that rights and obligations which constitute a financial instrument are not covered by the general rule applicable to consumer contracts as that could lead to different laws being applicable to each of the instruments issued therefore changing their nature and preventing their fungible trading and offering likewise whenever such instruments are issued or offered the contractual relationship established between the issuer or the offeror and the consumer should not necessarily be subject to the mandatory application of the law of the country of habitual residence of the consumer as there is a need to ensure uniformity in the terms and conditions of an issuance or an offer the same rationale should apply with regard to the multilateral systems covered by article 41h in respect of which it should be ensured that the law of the country of habitual residence of the consumer will not interfere with the rules applicable to contracts concluded within those systems or with the operator of such systems 29 for the purposes of this regulation references to rights and obligations constituting the terms and conditions govern ing the issuance offers to the public or public takeover bids of transferable securities and references to the subscription and redemption of units in collective invest ment undertakings should include the terms governing inter alia the allocation of securities or units rights in the event of oversubscription withdrawal rights and similar matters in the context of the offer as well as those matters referred to in articles 10 11 12 and 13 thus ensuring that all relevant contractual aspects of an offer binding the issuer or the offeror to the consumer are governed by a single law 30 for the purposes of this regulation financial instruments and transferable securities are those instruments referred to in article 4 of directive 200439ec 31 nothing in this regulation should prejudice the operation of a formal arrangement designated as a system under article 2a of directive 9826ec of the european parliament and of the council of 19 may 1998 on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems 3 32 owing to the particular nature of contracts of carriage and insurance contracts specific provisions should ensure an adequate level of protection of passengers and policy holders therefore article 6 should not apply in the context of those particular contracts 33 where an insurance contract not covering a large risk covers more than one risk at least one of which is situated in a member state and at least one of which is situated in a third country the special rules on insurance contracts in this regulation should apply only to the risk or risks situated in the relevant member state or member states 34 the rule on individual employment contracts should not prejudice the application of the overriding mandatory provisions of the country to which a worker is posted in accordance with directive 9671ec of the european parliament and of the council of 16 december 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services 4 l 1778 en official journal of the european union 472008 1 oj l 375 31121985 p 3 directive as last amended by directive 200818ec of the

them by provisions which cannot be derogated from by agreement or which can only be derogated from to their benefit 36 as regards individual employment contracts work carried out in another country should be regarded as temporary if the employee is expected to resume working in the country of origin after carrying out his tasks abroad the conclusion of a new contract of employment with the original employer or an employer belonging to the same group of companies as the original employer should not preclude the employee from being regarded as carrying out his work in another country temporarily 37 considerations of public interest justify giving the courts of the member states the possibility in exceptional circum stances of applying exceptions based on public policy and overriding mandatory provisions the concept of over riding mandatory provisions should be distinguished from the expression provisions which cannot be derogated from by agreement and should be construed more restrictively 38 in the context of voluntary assignment the term relation ship should make it clear that article 141 also applies to the property aspects of an assignment as between assignor and assignee in legal orders where such aspects are treated separately from the aspects under the law of obligations however the term relationship should not be understood as relating to any relationship that may exist between assignor and assignee in particular it should not cover preliminary questions as regards a voluntary assignment or a contractual subrogation the term should be strictly limited to the aspects which are directly relevant to the voluntary assignment or contractual subrogation in ques tion 39 for the sake of legal certainty there should be a clear definition of habitual residence in particular for companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporated unlike article 601 of regulation ec no 442001 which establishes three criteria the conflictoflaw rule should proceed on the basis of a single criterion otherwise the parties would be unable to foresee the law applicable to their situation 40 a situation where conflictoflaw rules are dispersed among several instruments and where there are differences between those rules should be avoided this regulation however should not exclude the possibility of inclusion of conflictoflaw rules relating to contractual obligations in provisions of community law with regard to particular matters this regulation should not prejudice the application of other instruments laying down provisions designed to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market in so far as they cannot be applied in conjunction with the law designated by the rules of this regulation the application of provisions of the applicable law designated by the rules of this regulation should not restrict the free movement of goods and services as regulated by commu nity instruments such as directive 200031ec of the european parliament and of the council of 8 june 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular electronic commerce in the internal market directive on electronic commerce 1 41 respect for international commitments entered into by the member states means that this regulation should not affect international conventions to which one or more member states are parties at the time when this regulation is adopted to make the rules more accessible the commis sion should publish the list of the relevant conventions in the official journal of the european union on the basis of information supplied by the member states 42 the commission will make a proposal to the european parliament and to the council concerning the procedures and conditions according to which member states would be entitled to negotiate and conclude on their own behalf agreements with third countries in individual and excep tional cases concerning sectoral matters and containing provisions on the law applicable to contractual obligations 43 since the objective of this regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore by reason of the scale and effects of this regulation be better achieved at community level the community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to attain its objective 44 in accordance with article 3 of the protocol on the position of the united kingdom and ireland annexed to the treaty on european union and to the treaty establishing the european community ireland has notified its wish to take part in the adoption and application of the present regulation 45 in accordance with articles 1 and 2 of the protocol on the position of the united kingdom and ireland annexed to the treaty on european union and to the treaty establishing the

review of contracts proposed by counterparties more and more in the form of general specifications or quality agreements etc and the review of amendments to manes supply agreement proposals that are made by counterparties our very first concern is liability a provision to limit it is compulsory in any document under which mane commits to sells products other key concerns are ipr applicable law exclusivity warranty liability the mandatory provision liability cap we must always have a cap of some kind related to the turnover for mane try first to limit to the amount of the order or 50 of the amount of the products invoiced in the year preceding the claim then we can escalate to the amount of products invoiced in the preceding year if the customer continues to push then we should continue to push back arguing for the legitimacy of a cap arguments for the cap mane does not sign supply agreements without a limitation of liability it is standard in our industry and other industries for the component supplier to cap its liability a cap establishes a proportion between the commercial relationship ie revenues achieved and the risk that mane must accept reflects risk sharing rather than risk transfer particularly as the customer inspected the products and accepted them for use mane cannot take on the full liability for the customers products in the market the customer has sole discretion over whether and how to process the products and where and how to market and sell its products that incorporate manes products the consumer market is not manes business and we dont achieve the revenues that correspond to the products in the market which would provide a natural form of insurance for product failures mane does not carry insurance coverage at a sufficient level to protect against liabilities that arise from our customers activities in the consumer marketplace manes prices are structured to reflect the risk that mane is able to take we would need to charge higher prices if we would be liable on our customers products in the consumer market consider that the liability cap bears no relationship to the insurance coverage that mane carries customers and even members of the mane sales group will sometimes take the position that the cap can be higher because of the level of manes insurance but this is not valid exclusions from liability we should always exclude consequential damages as the very minimum under any applicable law under other laws than french laws we must also exclude indirect punitive incidental and special damages punitive damages probably cannot be excluded by contract under certain us states applicable laws but we usually state this anyway indemnity we try to avoid use of hold harmless parties generally do not intend for this to mean something in addition to indemnify but courts will interpret in some meaning to hold harmless that is separate from indemnify indemnity is granted only as to direct damages we also strive to avoid any commitment to defend or to be responsible for costs or attorneys fees ipr exclusivity intellectual property under no circumstances will mane assign or transfer ipr some parties including mane contract managers confuse this with exclusivity further it should be expressly stated that the ipr in and relating to the products their manufacture development or creation including any improvements specifications formulation and documentation belong to mane a customer may argue for joint development terms so that it can share in the ipr but this is almost never truly the case as mane is the party actually developing the ipr exclusivity generally we avoid exclusivity conditions in supply contracts and would only agree upon specified commercial conditions in a separate agreement if exclusivity has to be granted to be validate by business management several conditions must circumscribe it restricted geographic scope limited duration limited to a specified productreference as identified by product code limited to particular application and either a minimum annual purchase requirement or a reciprocal commitment by the customer to purchase its needs for this flavor fragrance in this application exclusively from mane applicable law and jurisdiction arbitration specify governing law and exclusive jurisdiction for resolution of disputes us 1 ohio hamilton county 2 new york southern district of new york 3 delaware no to california europe 1 france 2 switzerland geneva asia 1 france 2 hong kong 3 singapore exception contracts between ptmi indonesian parties to be governed by the laws of republic of indonesia and must be submitted to bani arbitration governing law and jurisdiction should align in us for instance it is probably not advisable to specify a california court may hear the case but should apply new york laws we try for order shown below we assert that we always seek neutral laws and jurisdiction with our customers if we cannot get our own home laws arguing that the customer should not be privileged with a home court advantage arbitration we generally try to avoid mandatory arbitration main advantage confidentiality main disadvantage expensive especially when we contract with much bigger companies in the us more particularly more expensive may be faster than litigation although it probably just depends but it may be better for mane especially if it is a claim against mane andor is particularly complex to not rush to a decision arbitrator is motivated to extend controversy because payment is higher whereas courts are motivated to move claims off docket riskier because it highly depends on quality and experience of the arbitrator arbitrators are known to split the baby meaning that notwithstanding how speculative a claim might be they will say you each have your points and divide the claim counterparties know this and use mandatory arbitration as a way of enhancing the likelihood of achieving at least some kind of award rules especially in terms of discovery and admission of evidence are more permissive than in standard litigation needs to be organized in the arbitration clause no appeals possible there seems to be greater right for the arbitrator to make a subjective determination rather than being bound by precedent in quite the same way that a court would be product specifications inspection warranty product specifications necessary definition and inspection specifications manes specifications technical data sheets govern if the customer argues we can accept mutually agreedupon specifications in any case customers specifications must be validated and agreed in writing by mane to be applicable time limit for inspection we must always state a time limit for the customers inspection of the products for obvious patent defects we start at 5 days next is 10 days then we might go to 10 working days or 14 days anything longer is too much to accept remedies and warranties for nonconformity claims for defects defects noticeable upon unloading shortages excess or apparently damaged products must be notified to the carrier and mane within 3 days maximum other defects specify a time limit to notify of a claim for defect whether patent or latent after discovery and generally should insist on a maximum of 5 days after discovery there shouldnt be argument on why the customer would require a much longer period to notify mane of a discovered defect manes acknowledgment of nonconformity we cannot accept that the customer unilaterally decides that the products are defective it must be proven defective our preferred approach 1 customer files its claim with mane 2 mane inspects onsite or receives a sample to inspect 3 if mane confirms the claim a remedy is followed but if mane disputes the claim an independent lab agreed upon by the parties makes the determination consequences of nonconformity the customer may not send the products back to mane without manes consent the customer cannot be entitled to cancel the order or charge a fee remedies for nonconformity if mane acknowledges the claim mane will either replace the product or reimburse the amounts paid in respect of the defective nonconforming product this is offered as the sole compensation or sole remedy if the customer insists and strongly objects to this as the sole remedy we can withdraw but we will not accept that the customer expressly reserves the right to invoke rights in addition to one of these remedies warranties mane should only warrant that the products will comply with the specifications the warranty is linked to the time limit for claims but could be made for the shelf life stated by mane if unlimited duration is required this is the maximum that we can accept we will also warrant to compliance with applicable laws and regulations although we should probably avoid further warranting to industry standards these are the sole warranties the warranties do not extend to defects that result from the customers improper storage handling or use including such that does not conform to the specifications andor manes instructions we do not warrant free from defects defects is ambiguous and subjective term we expressly exclude the warranties of merchantability and fitness for the particular purpose if the customer insists on fitness for the purpose we can accept provided it is stated that such specific purpose must have been delivered in writing by the customer we resist as much as we can to warranty against infringement if it becomes a dealbreaker not to warrant that the products do not infringe upon third party ipr then we strive for i to the best of manes knowledge and ii that the warranty applies only to manes products as such or in themselves and ensure we are excluding the possibility of a warranty as to manes product in application ie manes product after customers processing or combination with something else ordering delivery process order mane must confirm an order we usually offer three working days better five for europe for it to be binding upon such acceptance the order is a contract binding upon both parties and may not be cancelled mane should implicitly reserve the right to reject orders but if the customer resists the possibility of mane having the right to turn down orders then we can accept to state that mane may not reject orders except if the order states a quantity that is so substantially large that we cannot produce to that level or upon the leadtime asserted or if the order includes nonagreed terms if the customer strongly insists upon the right to cancel open orders we can sometimes accept but strictly upon the condition that mane has not begun production of the goods under the order forecasts either binding on both or binding on neither mane cannot accept to be contractually bound to produce to forecasts if the customer is not obliged to purchase accordingly better not to mention in the contract any forecast from the customer if the customer has no intention to be bound by it if the parties will have a mutually binding forecast manes supply agreement template provides guidelines on requirements flexibility rules of rolling forecast stock if the customer requires mane to hold stock it should be set up in a separate stock keeping agreement this independent contract will impose obligations on the customer to ensure the stock is purchased delivery mane specifies the delivery leadtime on an exw basis meaning leadtime until we place the products at the disposal of the customer at manes premises not cleared for export and not loaded we prefer selling our products on an fca mane production facility basis as per icc 2010 incoterms meaning delivery occurs when we load the goods on the means of transport provided by the carrier at manes premises we strive to avoid penalties for delays or quantity defects if from the business perspective we cannot reject the principle of such penalties for delayed delivery or quantity defects penalties must be negotiated as follows penalty calculation must be clearly defined in the contract and can only apply to product defects or delayed delivery penalty requirement penalties must only apply to late deliver or product defect never more than 10 the total associated sale value no more than 2 per week delivery is delayed mane requires 30 day right to object penalty must be expressly stated as liquidated damage and exclusive remedy strive to prevent customer right to cancel method of paymentdeduction from future invoices must be spelled out we also strive to avoid time is of the essence because then ontime delivery becomes a material condition and since delays do occur it can be a big risk area any provisions on transport and delivery must align with the agreedupon incoterm also risk of loss is determined by the applicable incoterm transfer of title our starting point is transfer at time of full payment for the goods but if the customer argues we can generally accept title transfer upon delivery financial conditions prices we cannot accept to refer to the order to determine the prices the prices should either be in the supply agreement itself or in a separate offer sent by mane applicable icc 2010 incoterm to be specified preferred fca mane production facility price changes prices are only locked during a validity period stated by mane and after such time mane can update the prices at its discretion during the price validity period mane should reserve the right to update prices in case of a substantial rise in the cost of the raw materials hardship clause in respect of price changes during the validity period we argue that such fluctuations in raw material prices are out of our control and we must avoid being bound to continue to honor contracts at existing prices if becomes prohibitively expensive to sell the products considering that our customers are other businesses they should understand this fundamental economics precept and acknowledge that they would likewise not want to be prevented from passing on additional costs they incur in their own sourcing payment payment terms 30 45 or 60 days from date of invoice anything longer than 60 days is invalid in europe in asia mane might accept a period up to 90 days but should be confirmed first by local management terms run strictly from date of invoice not receipt of invoice or receipt of goods we state no discount is granted for early payment unless management has expressly approved a discount late payments we try to state that mane reserves the right to suspend further delivery of products until all overdue payments are collected we also sometimes state that overdue payments bear interest per applicable laws although if applicable law like french law entitles mane to charge interest then it seems unnecessary to require the mention of this implicit right set off some customers include a clause entitling it to set off amounts that it asserts mane owes to it against payments due to mane generally we reject these clauses if the customer insists then we state that mane must first validate the amount that the customer claims that mane owes to it it should not often be the case that mane owes the customer money anyway mane contracting party the contracting party to a supply agreement among the mane entities must be the invoicing mane company all mane companies are invoicing except as follows asia mane korea is not invoicing emea only the following companies on top of vmf are invoicing as follows only the following products ice cream flavors and mixes former gelcrem products and products manufactured in rubi all other sales in emea are invoiced from vmf miscellaneous legal entity confirm the entity is indeed an active registered entity in a certain jurisdiction it is generally best to state the companys jurisdiction and principal physical address recitals if the contract contains a preamble including whereas clauses it is advisable to avoid placing operative terms in this section as this is generally regarded as the place to set the table for the contract rather than begin establishing binding contractual conditions sometimes terms are defined in the preamble which is usually okay since their use occurs in the operative part of the contract applicable documents check for all references to the applicability of an external document eg supplier expectations code of conduct etc all external documents must be submitted to the contract review procedure including review by legal and in some cases eg specifications should be attached as exhibits to the contract general terms conditions of both parties are excluded purpose it is prudent to state the purpose of the contract which should be to establish the terms and conditions for manes sale and the customers purchase of the goods identified to the contract further we generally should state that the products are intended to be integrated into the customers own products and may not be resold as is provided to a mane competitor or repackaged for distribution to third parties make sure that agreement is a supply contract as some customers attempt to consider mane as a toll manufacturer or service provider confidentiality it is generally advisable to state that the parties will keep technical and commercial information confidential for instance the customer may learn things about manes pricing cost inputs although this is not something the business should be disclosing and administrative information be watchful if we have an existing cda with the customer however as we may need to specifically state that the cda applies particularly so we dont inadvertently supersede the cda by including confidentiality obligations here force majeure mane cannot have liability of any kind in case of true force majeure circumstances we can accept that the customer may terminate the agreement with immediate effect if the force majeure condition persists for more than 90 days it is advisable to state periods of time in either days or years because a month can be more ambiguous does it mean 30 days 31 days 28 days because of four sevenday weeks it could also arguably be interpreted to mean full calendar months must elapse eg if the contract is effective july 10th and specifies some right accrues after 3 months perhaps all of august september and october ie 3 months must pass probably what is meant is the right occurs on october 10th but using 90 days just avoids all that interpretation term it is probably prudent to state a term anywhere from 1 to 5 years depending on the circumstances and managements opinion we can structure to automatically renew or renew only upon mutual agreement in any case the prices if mentioned in the agreement must be valid for the price validity period only termination termination of the supply agreement does not end the customers obligation to fulfill its purchase commitment under outstanding orders we generally seek a thirty day cure period for termination due to default assignment no assignment without consent generally we want to have the ability to negotiate separately with a different party amendment state that amendment is possible only upon mutual written agreement no waiver state that failure to insist upon strict compliance does not constitute a waiver severability state that if a provision is held invalid or unenforceable the other provisions are not affected and only the offending provision is excluded some counterparties instead state that the offending provision is to be construed to most closely approximate the parties intent while taking a legally valid form it is fine as an alternative entire agreement state that the contract constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes previous agreements confirm that this is the case and there arent active agreements that we want to keep but could be impacted by this contract signatures mane prefers wet signatures when feasible however situations will arise where an electronic signature is required due to counterparty demands or practicalities of the situation in these situations a variance from the wet signature requirement may be granted by the assigned legal counsel on a casebycase basis subject to the requirements of this section in order for mane to accept an electronic signature the agreement must be governed by laws that allow for electronic signatures to be binding on the parties the signature itself must be validated to both european union and local requirements this means that the signature must use twofactor authentication or a digital certificate meeting the requirements of the eidas regulation the electronic signature services selected by many mane counterparties do not comply with these requirements in order to facilitate the collection of compliant signatures mane has contracted with docusign to provide a platform for collecting and validating electronic signatures if a contract is approved for electronic signature and the counterparty does not provide a compliant method of signing the contract then the mane contract manager shall request the regional docusign account holder to generate an electronic envelope containing the document the contract manager will supply the person generating the envelope with the name title and email address of the signer in order to meet eu electronic signature requirements the signer will either have to supply their mobile phone number to the mane contact to receive an sms password or obtain a digital certificate at their own expense originals require that the counterparty execute two originals so that each party may receive its own original hard copy if the signatures are not to be electronic we may accept to language that specifies a facsimile or electronic copy qualifies as an original provided we make it clear to the counterparty that we nevertheless require to receive a hard copy original individual signers the parties should have authorized representatives execute beware of duly authorized and make sure it is the case theoretically counterparty might be able to avoid a contract if it can successfully claim that an unauthorized employee entered into a commitment nevertheless it is helpful to keep in mind that we should be looking for individuals with appropriate titles as the signatories when french laws are applicable in case of doubt on the capacity of the signatory to sign the contract in the name and on behalf of the company the following is to be sent in an email to the counterparty by mane contract manager thank you for confirming that mrmrs in hisher quality of is entitled to sign the contract for and on behalf of the companybefore the country mane affiliate

products the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their economic and social development it considers that while the provisions of the treaty establishing the european community and secondary legislation apply automatically to the outermost regions it is nonetheless possible to adopt specific measures to assist them inasmuch and as long as there is an objective need to take such

intended readership of the guide chapterxa0iii deals with issues of private international law namely the determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts whether chosen or not by the parties reference is made to the texts prepared by the hague conference on private international law hcch specifically the hcch principles on choice of law in international commercial contracts chapterxa0iv deals with the uniform law of international sales discussing in particular the provisions of the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods the convention on the limitation period in the international sale of goods and the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts and their interaction chapterxa0 iv also contains a reference to regional uniform texts and to model contracts based on uniform texts chapterxa0v contains a summary of recurring legal issues that arise frequently in connection with sales contracts and how they are addressed in uniform law instruments 1 i introduction a origin and purpose of the guide 1 for several decades the hague conference on private international law hcch the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral and the international institute for the unification of private law unidroit have been preparing uniform law texts that promote the progressive harmonization and modernization of commercial contract law other international governmental and nongovernmental organizations have also made significant contributions at the global and regional levels 2 over time the hcch uncitral and unidroit have produced a series of texts that are complementary the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods 1980 cisg1 the unidroit principles of inter national commercial contracts upicc2 and the hcch principles on choice of law in international commercial contracts hcch principles3 in addition uncitral has prepared treaties such as the united nations convention on the use of electronic communications in international contracts 2005 electronic communications convention4 and the convention on the limitation period in the international sale of goods 1974 amended in 1980 limitation convention5 that are closely related to the cisg and complement it with regard to specific matters6 similarly the hcch has historically adopted a number of treaties that deal with choice of law rules in international sales the convention on the law applicable to international sales of goods 1955 hcch 1955 sales of goods convention7 the convention on the law applicable to agency 1978 hcch 1978 agency convention8 and the convention on the law applicable to con tracts for the international sale of goods 1986 hcch 1986 sales convention9 1 united nations treaty series volxa01489 noxa025567 2 the most recent version the upicc 2016 is available on the unidroit website 3 the hcch principles are available on the hcch website 4 united nations treaty series

to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts in relation to sales unidroit adopted the convention on agency on the inter national sale of goods 1983 regulating substantive aspects of agency10 3 the drafting of the abovementioned texts was often carried out in coordina tion with the other organizations a good illustration of this is the legislative history of the cisg for the preparation of which uncitral took advantage of earlier uniform texts developed by unidroit11 in turn the cisg influenced the development of later uniform texts such as the upicc moreover texts like the hcch principles build upon and help implement the cisg and the upicc 4 to achieve their intended purpose uniform texts need to be accompanied by adequate support for their implementation the three organizations have developed a range of tools to that end such as the case law on uncitral texts clout information system12 the unilex database which contains a collection of among others international case law on the upicc13 and the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts14 5 uniform international trade law is aimed at achieving a harmonized and global set of rules which are international in their origin formulation and framework of application and interpretation consequently uniform law diminishes the legal obstacles to the flow of international trade levels the playing field among buyers and sellers strengthens commercial relations among states and generates invest ment opportunities in the light of the manifold advantages of uniform law in this sector the abovementioned uniform texts were developed to introduce balanced rules suitable for international transactions and to assist parties in drafting their contracts and adjudicators in resolving disputes each of the texts provides the parties with some autonomy to decide by agreement the extent to which the text will govern their transaction however information on how the texts relate to each other is not always readily available as a result commercial parties lawyers judges arbitrators academic researchers and legislators interested in adopting applying or interpreting that vast legislative corpus may face challenges in identifying the relevant texts and placing them in context 10 the convention did not enter into force and has now been superseded by the upicc which contain a detailed section on agency in chapter 2 formation and authority of agents see also para 369 and chap v sectxa0c below 11 see the convention relating to a uniform law on the international sale of goods 1964 united nations treaty series volxa0834 noxa011929 and the convention relating to a uniform law on the formation of contracts for the international sale of goods 1964 united nations treaty series volxa0834 noxa011930 for more on these two conventions see paraxa0286 below see also the hcch 1955 sales of goods convention 12 available on the uncitral website 13 available on the unilex website 14 available on the unidroit website i introduction 3 6 the present legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts with a focus on sales the guide is aimed at clarifying the relationship among the texts with a view to promoting their adoption use and uniform interpretation and ultimately the establishment of a predictable and flex ible legal environment for crossborder commercial transactions based on the prin ciple of freedom of contract 7 accordingly the guide provides orientation to the reader on a range of legal issues relating to international commercial contract law from choice of law to the legislative contractual and guidance texts that may assist in a commercial transaction the guide is not intended to favour any particular interpretation or to offer any new interpretation of uniform texts 8 the guide was prepared on the basis of a joint proposal15 which had resulted from a series of events organized by the uncitral secretariat to celebrate the thirtyfifth anniversary of the cisg16 it was approved by the governing bodies of the hcch uncitral and unidroit17 it was compiled by the respective sec retariats with input from a group of five experts representing different legal tradi tions and geographical backgrounds neil cohen united states of america lauro da gama e souza jr brazil pilar perales viscasillas spain hiroo sono japan and stefan vogenauer germany it is designed to be a living document and will be kept under review by the three secretariats with a view to its periodic revision b scope and approach 9 the guide deals with international commercial contracts with a particular focus on sales consumer contracts are not covered the guide also provides guid ance on the interaction between sales contracts and certain closely related transactions such as barter agency and distribution it further provides guidance on crosscutting issues such as the use of electronic communications 10 the guide deals specifically with the uniform texts prepared by the hcch uncitral and unidroit it refers to legislative texts such as treaties and model 15 note by the

document cd 95 misc 2 paraxa018 available on the unidroit website 4 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts laws as well as principles and model clauses that are designed to be implemented by the parties in their contractual arrangements 11 the guide is thus an effort to clarify the relationship among those uniform international legal texts and is a document prepared jointly by the three secretariats to promote uniformity certainty and clarity in this area of the law 12 the guide makes reference to uniform texts prepared by other international governmental and nongovernmental organizations with a global or regional scope to the extent that those texts assist in clarifying the operation of hcch uncitral and unidroit texts reference is also made to guidance documents that may offer useful additional information to the reader the guide is not aimed at providing an exhaustive list of global and regional texts relevant to international commercial contracts in particular the guide does not cover those international instruments which although not primarily addressing international sales contracts refer to the cisg and the upicc as an expression of general principles and provisions suitable for modern contract laws18 13 the guide contains a discussion of private international law pil19 issues focusing on the hcch principles and their relation to the cisg and the upicc with a view to explaining the extent to which the contractual parties may choose the applicable law and the consequences of not making such a choice the guide also provides an overview of the content of the cisg and the limitation conven tion the nature use and content of the upicc are covered and similarities and differences between the cisg and other uniform texts with which the upicc may interact are highlighted finally the guide contains references to a number of recurrent legal issues related to sales contracts 18 a recent example is the legal guide on contract farming by unidroit the food and agriculture organiza tion of the united nations and the international fund for agricultural development which is a guidance instru ment on agricultural production under contract adopted in 2015 it is available on the unidroit website 19 it is generally understood that pil consists of three elements a jurisdiction b applicable law and c recogni tion and enforcement of foreign judgments administrative and judicial cooperation relating to these issues are also covered by pil in the guide the term pil is used mainly with reference to applicable law and choice of law issues in line with the use of that term in certain uniform instruments eg cisg artxa07 paraxa02 the term choice of law is also used when it is necessary to reflect the terminology of the relevant instrument 5 ii why read the guide 14 the existence of different legal political and economic systems around the world leads to legal fragmentation that is an obstacle to the flow of trade uniform law provides rules that are coherent and consistent on a global scale in particular uniform law provides a uniform legal regime for international20 sale of goods con tracts by doing so it facilitates the development of international trade 15 parties entering into international contracts particularly those for the sale of goods are faced with a plethora of uniform law instruments these instruments are very useful both because they lead to uniformity in or harmonization of the laws of different states and because they can simplify clarify and modernize the law for this important aspect of commerce 16 however it is not always obvious how these uniform law instruments inter act with and complement each other the purpose of the guide is to provide an intro duction to and a brief summary of several important legal instruments con cerning such contracts that have been prepared by the hcch uncitral and unidroit emphasis is placed on the complementary nature of these instruments when more than one instrument applies to a transaction 17 the guide can assist both parties and their lawyers as well as mediators arbitrators and judges in navigating the uniform instruments that may be applicable the intended result is to enable parties to efficiently and effectively structure their commercial transactions in the light of the benefits presented by the instruments 18 in view of its purpose and nature the guide does not purport to offer an exhaustive treatment of the content of each instrument and of the interpretation thereof by judges arbitrators and scholars rather it provides introductory guidance to navigating them so as to assist in understanding their scope basic provisions and interaction there are several useful sources some available online at no cost con taining case law bibliographies and other information relating to these instruments a list of available sources of further information is provided in the annex 20 the concept of internationality which is more specific or broader depending on the instrument will be explained in the relevant section for each individual instrument below 6 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 19 the instruments that are the primary focus of the guide are a cisg as its name suggests the cisg provides rules for the formation of contracts and the rights and obligations of the parties for the international sale of goods when it is applicable it provides neutral legal rules governing such contracts and largely avoids the necessity of determining which states law governs key issues thus the cisg may contribute significantly to introducing certainty in commercial exchanges and decreasing transaction costs b upicc the upicc are a nonbinding codification of contract law rules and principles designed to be applied to commercial contracts on a global scale their objective is to provide parties as well as adjudicators and other users with a set of balanced rules that are particularly well suited to crossborder transactions being a softlaw instrument they offer parties and adjudicators a range of different options as to their use and an ample degree of flexibility c hcch principles the hcch principles are also a nonbinding set of principles providing guidance for the development and refinement of legal rules governing the extent and application of the principle that parties to a commercial contract have the autonomy to select by agreement the law governing their contract the hcch principles acknowledge and promote the principle of party autonomy parties to a contract may be best positioned to determine which set of legal norms is best suited to their transaction and at the same time set balanced boundaries for the principle thus they are aimed at providing a refinement of the concept of party autonomy where it is already accepted 20 two instruments emanating from uncitral are also addressed a limitation convention the limitation convention establishes uniform rules governing the period of time within which a party to a contract for the inter national sale of goods must commence legal proceedings to assert a claim arising from the contract by doing so it brings clarity and predictability to an aspect of great importance for the adjudication of the claim b electronic communications convention the electronic communica tions convention is aimed at legally enabling the use of electronic communications in international trade by assuring that communications exchanged electronically including contracts are as valid and enforceable as their paperbased equivalents 21 in addition reference is made to other instruments emanating from inter national supranational or regional bodies a hcch 1955 sales of goods convention the hcch 1955 sales of goods convention regulates the choice of law issues for the international sale of tangible goods ii why read the guide 7 b hcch 1978 agency convention the hcch 1978 agency convention provides choice of law rules for agency relationships c hcch 1986 sales convention the hcch 1986 sales convention sets out choice of law rules relating to contracts for the international sale of goods it is not yet in force d regulation ec noxa05932008 of the european parliament and of the council of 17 june 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations rome i regulation the rome i regulation sets out european unionwide rules for determining which national law should apply to contractual obligations in civil and commercial matters involving more than one country e interamerican convention on the law applicable to international contracts 1994 mexico convention21 the mexico convention sets out rules for deter mining the law applicable to international contracts within states parties to the convention 22 as noted above the instruments addressed in the guide are not mutually exclusive rather more than one instrument can apply to the same transaction a simple illustration of this point appears in table 1 below which indicates by way of an asterisk in the appropriate boxes the international instruments that may apply to four transactions in four instances table 1 application of international instruments to different transactions transaction cisg upicc hcch principles limitation convention electronic communications convention international sale of goods not concluded by electronic communications international sale of goods concluded by electronic communications commercial contracts other than international sale of goods not concluded by electronic communications commercial contracts other than international sale of goods concluded by electronic communications 21 organization of american states treaty series noxa078 see also parasxa05758 below 8 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 23 the guide contains an explanation of the difference between the circum stances in which the conventions and regulations as hardlaw instruments are applicable and have the force of law and the circumstances where softlaw instru ments such as the upicc and the hcch principles may be applied moreover inasmuch as the applicability of hardlaw instruments such as the cisg may depend on the determination of which states law is applicable the guide provides information about the nature and sources of rules that govern the determination of the applicable law 24 because of the critical role played by the determination of applicable law the guide contains an examination not only of the choice of law rules under the hcch principles but also of the other pil rules that may be applicable in a forum hence an analysis is presented in the guide of choice of law rules under the romexa0 i regulation the mexico convention and the hcch instruments men tioned in paragraphxa021 ac above a brief survey of pil rules used in various states is also presented in the guide a key portion of the analysis relates to party autonomy the ability of the parties under most choice of law regimes to select the law that governs their contract and its limits 25 another aspect of what is usually referred to as party autonomy is considered as well the parties freedom of contract to choose the rights and responsibilities with respect to each other subject to the limits put in place by the applicable law reference is also made to terms that parties may incorporate in their sales contracts by way of a shorthand clause the content and interpretation of which are provided by an international body an example is the international chamber of commerce icc incoterms which are shorthand clauses collected and developed by the icc and which reflect international practice in addition the role played by commercial practices established between the parties and usages when the sales contract is regulated by an international instrument is highlighted in the guide 9 iii determination of the law applicablexa0 toxa0 international commercialxa0 contracts a direct application of a uniform law treaty how do uniform law treaties apply to an internationalxa0contract 26 modern uniform law treaties apply to international contracts when the require ments for their territorial and substantive application are met the cisg the limitation convention and the electronic communications convention each define their scope of application namely the crossborder contracts and commu nications to which their provisions apply by stating the requirements that must be satisfied if those requirements are satisfied the conventions apply without the need for recourse to pil rules cisg 27 in relation to its territorial scope of application articlexa01 paragraphxa01 of the cisg provides for two ways in which the cisg applies directly to international sales contracts a when the parties respective places of business22 as determined under the cisg are in different contracting states see parasxa0 106109 below and b when pil rules lead to the application of the law of a contracting state the latter case includes situations in which the law of a contracting state applies because the parties have selected it in the contract 28 international sales contracts may fall outside the scope of the cisg when the type of sales contract is not covered under the convention artxa02 or in the case of mixed contracts in which the provision of labour or services is predomi nant artxa03 the precise nature of these and other limits to the applicability of 22 for the determination of the relevant place of business under the cisg see paras148150 below 10 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts the cisg has been explored by a number of court decisions arbitral awards and doctrinal authorities23 the law applicable to sales contracts outside the scope of the cisg is determined by the application of pil rules24 29 articlexa0 6 of the cisg allows the parties to opt out of the convention or derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions with the exception of articlexa012 thus embodying the autonomy principles referred to in paragraphs 24 and 25 above according to almost unanimous case law and scholarly opinion a contractual provision indicating which state law governs a contract does not con stitute such an optout rather if the choice is of a contracting state and it is given effect by pil rules the result is that the cisg applies 30 the applicability of the cisg to a contract may also be affected by the declarations lodged by states see parasxa0106110 and 283286 below25 limitation convention 31 with regard to the territorial scope of application of the limitation convention articlexa03 of that convention provides that the treaty applies directly to international sales contracts when the parties respective places of business are in different contracting states or when the pil rules lead to the application of the law of a contracting state moreover parties may contractually agree on the application of the limitation convention including by choosing the law of a contracting state when allowed under pil rules see chapxa0iii sectxa0b below articlexa03 paragraphxa02 of the convention allows the parties to agree on the exclusion of the application of the convention opting out26 32 the applicability of the limitation convention to a contract may also be affected by the declarations lodged by states27 23 for example for the treatment of distribution contracts see chapterxa0v section b below and for the treat ment of barter see chapterxa0v section e below 24 for the choice of law rules including the choice of the upicc as nonstate law see chapterxa0iii section b below 25 for the status and text of the declarations made by the contracting states to the cisg see the unitedxa0 nations treaty collection website 26 the present paragraphxa0explains the scope of application of the limitation convention as amended by the 1980 protocol amending the limitation convention for more details including information on the scope of application of the original 1974 convention see chapterxa0iv section b below 27 for the status and text of the declarations made by the contracting states to the limitation convention see the united nations treaty collection website iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 11 electronic communications convention 33 the territorial and substantive scope of the electronic communications con vention is defined in articles 1 and 2 of the convention the convention applies to a broader variety of international commercial contracts than the cisg articlexa01 paragraphxa01 of the convention provides for its direct application when a pil rule leads to the application of the law of a contracting state according to articlexa019 a contracting state may lodge a declaration that it will apply the convention when the parties respective places of business are in different contracting states the electronic communications convention is also applicable if the parties to the con tract have chosen its provisions as the law applicable to the contract however articlexa03 allows the parties to opt out of the application of the convention or dero gate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions b application of pil rules 34 as seen above international transactions can be governed by uniform law instruments that apply directly to the contract or by virtue of pil rules 35 most jurisdictions if not all have pil rules to which a court can refer in order to identify the law applicable to a particular legal relationship in the context of crossborder sales or transactions there are two main ways of identifying the applicable law a when the parties have chosen the law governing their contract pil rules will determine whether the parties choice is valid and effective and bxa0 when the parties have not chosen the law governing their contract or their choice is invalid or ineffective pil rules will determine which law applies to the transaction 36 in this context a uniform law instrument may become applicable to an inter national transaction including sales contracts other than by direct application by virtue of pil rules 37 there are three pil routes by way of which a uniform law instrument may apply to an international transaction a when the parties have chosen as the law governing their transaction the law of a state that has adopted a uniform law treaty which applies to the transaction b when the parties have chosen a uniform law instrument as the rules of law to govern their transaction and c when in the absence of a choice of law by the parties the relevant pil rules lead to the applica tion of a uniform law treaty 12 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 38 each of these routes is dependent on applicable pil rules sometimes the rules are the domestic pil rules of a forum state while other times the pil rules are those contained in a treaty to which the forum state is a contracting state domestic pil rules may be influenced by softlaw principles such as the hcch principles 39 the subsections below contain an examination of pil rules found in treaties which will be helpful in determining which laws are applicable to an international transaction when examining these rules two scenarios will be considered a when the parties have made a choice of law and b when the parties have not made such a choice a brief summary of nontreaty pil rules soft law in particular the hcch principles is also provided 1 application of pil rules when parties make a choice of law 40 party autonomy as to the choice of the law applicable to international con tracts is generally accepted in most jurisdictions across the world it refers to the freedom of parties to select through an agreement the laws or legal systems to govern their contractual dealings it is however important to note that that autonomy is not without limitations and the extent of such autonomy differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 41 such differences concern various aspects of parties choices such as the aspects of the contract that can be governed by the chosen law formality require ments for making such choices and limitations imposed by public policy whether and to what extent parties can choose the law of a state or a nonstate law to govern their contracts will be addressed in the following subsections 42 there are several international instruments some of which are used more often than others that cover the issue of the law applicable to international con tracts and its application by state courts the hcch 1955 sales of goods conven tion the hcch 1978 agency convention the rome i regulation and the hcch principles the two hcch conventions and the rome i regulation which is a supranational instrument of mandatory application in the european union mem ber states except denmark are hardlaw instruments in contrast the hcch principles are a softlaw and nonbinding instrument of universal scope 43 the potential application of the mexico convention should also be noted the guide on the law applicable to international commercial contracts in the americas28 adopted by interamerican juridical committee of the organization of 28 the guide is available on the oas website iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 13 american states in 2019 provides inter alia guidance on both the mexico con vention and the hcch principles choice of state law or transnational nonstate law arbitral setting 44 in arbitration parties enjoy substantial freedom to choose nonstate rules of law applicable to the merits of their dispute such freedom was recognized as early as 1985 in articlexa028 paragraphxa01 of the uncitral model law on inter national commercial arbitration29 this model law as well as the uncitral arbitration rules30 have served as a model for many jurisdictions today in accord ance with most arbitration laws and rules arbitrators must uphold the parties choice concerning the rules of law governing their dispute rules of law and nonstate law 45 the notion of rules of law is specified in the hcch principles as including rules that do not emanate from state sources but that are generally accepted on an international supranational or regional level as a neutral and balanced set of rules hcch principles artxa03 thus rules of law may refer to legal rules such as the upicc created by nonlegislative bodies the requirement that the rules be generally accepted as a neutral and balanced set of rules leads to the conclusion that those trade codes and similar instruments that have not achieved this degree of credibility as neutral and balanced would not qualify as rules of law for the purposes of the hcch principles as discussed in paragraphxa071 below the hcch principles give effect to the choice of rules of law not only in an arbitral setting but also in a judicial setting provided that such choice is allowed under the otherwise applicable law 46 in an arbitral setting the cisg may be chosen as the law applicable even when the parties do not have their places of business in contracting states or the pil rules do not lead to the application of the cisg in this context the cisg may apply as transnational nonstate law judicial setting 47 in a judicial setting parties are generally free to choose the state law appli cable to their contracts most national laws do not allow parties to choose nonstate 29 uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration 1985 with amendments as adopted in 2006 united nations publication sales noxa0e08v4 for the status of enactments and additional information on the model law see the uncitral website 30 uncitral arbitration rules as revised in 2010 official records of the general assembly sixtyfifth session supplement noxa017 a6517 annex i 14 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts rules of law to govern the contract although in many cases this is the result of interpretation as the law is silent on this point31 nevertheless even in states that do not give effect to the choice of nonstate law by the parties nonstate law may still be applied indirectly by way of incorporation by reference namely as actual terms of the contract32 hcch 1955 sales of goods convention 48 the hcch 1955 sales of goods convention was one of the first steps towards unification of international sales law it regulates choice of law issues for the international sale of tangible goods the convention allows the parties to freely choose the applicable law artxa02 in general only one law can be identified as the applicable law with the exception of articlexa04 the choice of law can either be made expressly or unambiguously result from the provisions of the contract artxa02 the convention identifies only the law of a state as the applicable law but not nonstate law 49 the convention is currently in force in five european union member states denmark finland france italy and sweden and in the niger norway and switzerland33 thus for contracts that fall within its scope the convention takes precedence over the convention on the law applicable to contractual obliga tions34 and the rome i regulation see articles 21 and 25 paragraphxa01 of those instruments respectively hcch 1986 sales convention 50 the hcch 1986 sales convention is aimed at unifying choice of law rules relating to contracts for the international sale of goods it determines the law applicable to contracts for the sale of goods between parties having their places of business in different states and in all other cases involving a choice between the laws of different states it is a basic principle of the convention that international sales are regulated by the law chosen by the parties to the contract artxa07 paraxa01 such choice must be made expressly or clearly demonstrated by the terms of the contract and the conduct of the parties viewed in their entirety regarding either 31 inspired by the hcch principles in paraguay and uruguay national law expressly allows parties to choose nonstate law to govern their contracts paraguay law no 5393 on the law applicable to international con tracts of 15 january 2015 and uruguay law no 19920 on the general law of private international law of 27 november 2020 32 see also below particularly paragraphxa056 for incorporation as contractual terms under the rome i regula tion and paragraphxa0338 for incorporation as contractual terms of the upicc 33 for examples of its application see mathilde sumampouw ed les nouvelles conventions de la haye leur application par les juges nationaux volxa0iii dordrecht the netherlands martinus nijhoff 1984 pp 1520 report ing decisions from finland the netherlands and belgium see also the publications listed on the hcch website 34 united nations treaty series volxa01605 noxa028023 iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 15 the whole or part of the contract artxa07 paraxa02 in addition the law determined under the convention applies irrespective of whether or not it is the law of a contracting state 51 the convention was designed to replace the hcch 1955 sales of goods convention like the latter it identifies only the law of a state as the applicable law but not nonstate law hcch 1978 agency convention 52 the hcch 1978 agency convention is aimed at establishing common pro visions concerning the law applicable to agency it encompasses both commercial and noncommercial agency and regular and casual agency the convention pro vides choice of law rules for both the internal relationship between principal and agent and the external relationships between principal and third parties and agent and third parties 53 the law chosen by the parties is the primary rule for the internal relationship between principal and agent artxa05 the internal law chosen by the parties may be express or implied35 the term internal law indicates that only substantive law of the applicable state would be referred to in addition the law specified in the con vention is to apply irrespective of whether or not it is the law of a contracting state 54 the convention is in force in three european union member states france the netherlands and portugal and in argentina thus for contracts that fall within its scope the convention takes precedence over the rome i regulation see artxa025 paraxa01 rome i regulation 55 articlexa03 of the rome i regulation allows the parties to choose the law of a state to govern their contract such choice may be made either expressly or tacitly in regard to the whole or to only part of the contract 56 while the rome i regulation does not allow state courts to recognize the choice of a nonstate body of law such as the upicc as governing law it does not preclude parties from incorporating such rules into their contracts subject to general limits on freedom of contract under the applicable contract law the same applies to the choice of an international convention such as the cisg however the cisg may be otherwise applicable under its own terms and therefore prevail over the regulation 35 the internal law of the state in which the business establishment of the agent was located at the time of the relevant acts is to govern the two external relationships arts 11 and 15 16 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts mexico convention 57 the mexico convention also recognizes the parties freedom to choose the law applicable to their international contract the law chosen may relate to the whole or to only part of the contract such choice may be express or result from the parties behaviour and the overall terms of the contract 58 the convention has adopted a more flexible approach towards the applica tion of nonstate law in applying the state law governing the contract the court in accordance with articlexa010 is to take into account certain categories of nonstate law including guidelines customs and principles of international commercial law as well as commercial usages and generally accepted practices36 hcch principles 59 in line with todays generally accepted principle of party autonomy the hcch principles give effect to a choice by the parties artxa02 paraxa01 not only of state law as the law governing their international contract but also under certain conditions as further discussed in paragraphxa071 below of nonstate law artxa03 the law chosen may relate to the whole or to only part of the contract and differ ent laws may be chosen for governing different parts of the contract artxa02 paraxa02 no connection is required between the law chosen and the parties or the transac tion artxa02 paraxa04 such choice may be express or appear clearly from the provi sions of the contract or the circumstances artxa04 60 the rules of law ie nonstate law chosen by the parties must meet cer tain criteria a measure that is intended to afford greater legal certainty for details see paragraphxa071 below 61 since the hcch principles can serve as a model for national legislators they may be adopted as a domestic body of choice of law rules the effect of such an adoption would be that for matters litigated in a forum in that state the forum would give effect to a choice of transnational nonstate law interplay of choice of law and dispute resolution method including choice of forum 62 the pil rules determine the legal rules that govern the parties rights and obligations since those rules may differ from state to state it is essential to deter mine the applicable law when a dispute arises since the application of the law of one state rather than another may in some cases change the outcome of a dispute 36 see also the guide on the law applicable to international commercial contracts in the americas in particular paragraphxa0194 iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 17 yet it is equally important for parties to assess the effectiveness of their choice of law before concluding the contract so that they can determine their rights and obligations under the proposed contract before entering into it and thereby lower the probability of a dispute arising later assessing the effectiveness of the choice of law before the conclusion of the contract may also avoid surprises later if the parties had different assumptions as to which law would govern the effectiveness of a choice of law is closely related to the method of dispute resolution chosen by the parties 63 in arbitration the parties choice which can include transnational nonstate law is generally upheld by arbitral tribunals all over the world in contrast when parties decide to submit their future disputes to state courts they should choose a forum which gives full effect to their choice of law agreement 64 it is worth noting that an agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a court37 or an arbitral tribunal to determine disputes under the contract is not in itself equivalent to a tacit choice of law see for example articlexa04 of the hcch principles and articlexa07 of the mexico convention nevertheless when a choice of law has not been expressly made or clearly demonstrated a choice of court agreement may be a factor to be taken into account in determining whether the circumstances lead to the conclusion that the parties made a tacit choice of the law applicable to the contract see for example recital 12 of the rome i regulation and the commentary on articlexa04 of the hcch principles model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercialxa0contracts 65 the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts adopted in 2013 are a guidance document on how parties to a contract may refer to the upicc unlike binding instruments which are appli cable whenever the contract at hand falls within their scope and the parties have not excluded their application the upicc being a softlaw instrument offer a greater range of possibilities to parties of which they may not always be fully aware this is the reason behind the preparation of model clauses that parties may wish to adopt in order to indicate more precisely how they would like the upicc to be used either during the performance of the contract or when a dispute arises 37 in this regard the hcch convention of 30 june 2005 on choice of court agreements is aimed at ensuring the effectiveness of exclusive choice of court agreements between parties to international commercial transactions for more information on that convention see the hcch website recognition and enforcement of judgments deriving from a nonexclusive choice of court agreement will be governed by the hcch convention of 2 july 2019 on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in civil or commercial matters for more information on that convention see the hcch website 18 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 66 the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts reflect the different ways in which the upicc have been referred to by parties or applied by judges and arbitrators they are divided into four categories according to whether their purpose is a to choose the upicc as the rules of law governing the contract b to incorporate the upicc as terms of the contract c to refer to the upicc to interpret and supplement the cisg when the latter is chosen by the parties or d to refer to the upicc to interpret and supplement the applicable domestic law the commentaries under each model clause detail their advantages and disadvantages and point to possible modifica tions that parties may wish to introduce depending on their intent where appro priate for each model clause two versions are proposed one for inclusion in the contract predispute use and one for use after a dispute has arisen post dispute use38 hcch principles 67 the hcch principles are a nonbinding softlaw instrument containing gen eral principles and rules concerning choice of law in international contracts they recognize that giving effect to party autonomy at the global level is key to promoting crossborder commercial transactions as it enhances certainty and predictability in respect of the parties contractual arrangements 68 the main purpose of the hcch principles is to reinforce the parties free dom to choose the law applicable to international commercial contracts and to ensure that the law chosen has the widest scope of application subject to limited exceptions preamble first paragraph 69 the hcch principles provide rules only for situations in which the parties have made a choice of law express or tacit by agreement as opposed to the rome i regulation and the mexico convention which contain provisions dealing with the law applicable in the absence of a choice the hcch principles do not contain a comprehensive body of rules for determining the law applicable to inter national commercial contracts 38 it is important to note that the purpose of the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts is merely to allow parties to indicate more precisely the way they wish the upicc to be used thus even if parties decide not to use the model clauses judges and arbitrators may still apply the upicc according to the circumstances of the case as indicated in the upicc preamble for more information on the upicc and their intended use see chapterxa0iv section c below iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 19 70 the hcch principles are composed of a preamble and 12 articles while some provisions of the hcch principles reflect an approach that enjoys wide international consensus eg arts 2 paraxa01 and 11 other provisions reflect the view of the hcch as to best practice and provide helpful clarifications for those legal systems that accept party autonomy eg arts 2 parasxa024 4 7 and 9 the hcch principles also contain innovative provisions eg arts 3 5 6 and 8 71 one of the most prominent features of the hcch principles is the provision in articlexa0 3 that expressly allows the parties to choose rules of law ie trans national or nonstate law to govern their contract however such rules of law must be qualified as generally accepted on an international supranational or regional level as a neutral and balanced set of rules they will include international treaties and conventions as well as nonbinding instruments formulated by estab lished international bodies instruments such as the upicc and the cisg that is the cisg when applied as the law designated by the parties as opposed to its application as a treaty meet the conditions set forth in articlexa0 3 the hcch principles are however silent regarding the application of trade usages 72 party autonomy as recognized by the hcch principles is not absolute as in the law of all jurisdictions that recognize party autonomy the hcch principles impose limitations on it under articlexa011 a court or arbitral tribunal may decline to give effect to the law chosen by the parties in the exceptional circumstances where such law contravenes overriding mandatory rules or public policy ordre public of the forum or of a third state for more details see paraxa0100 below 73 the hcch principles may serve a harmonizing purpose since they can be adopted as a legislative model in those jurisdictions willing to modernize their pil rules with regard to contracts paraguay and uruguay which have already passed laws inspired by the hcch principles are examples see paraxa047 above 74 the hcch principles may also provide guidance to courts and arbitral tri bunals as to how to approach issues concerning the choice of law in international contracts lastly they may be useful for parties and their counsel in assessing the law or rules of law that may be effectively chosen 75 thus as a nonbinding instrument the hcch principles may be used a in the arbitral context b in the case where they supplement the pil rules of a given state or c where a state has adopted them as its pil rules for international contracts 20 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 2 application of pil rules in the absence of a parties choice 76 although most international contracts state the parties choice of the law to be applied to the contract in some instances such a choice may not have been made39 or may not be enforceable the adjudicator must then determine the law applicable to the contract by means of pil rules 77 the rules governing the determination of the law applicable in the absence of a choice by the parties may vary in accordance with the method of dispute reso lution chosen by the parties arbitral setting 78 in the absence of a choice of law agreement or in the case of the invalidity of such an agreement arbitrators enjoy a substantial degree of discretion in deter mining the law applicable to the merits of the dispute including both state law and nonstate rules of law 79 under a number of arbitration rules and laws the arbitral tribunal may directly determine the law applicable to the merits of the case without resort to pil rules eg icc arbitration rules artxa021 and french code of civil procedure artxa01511 this is called the voie directe method 80 on the other hand rules such as articlexa028 paragraphxa02 of the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration and section 46 paragraphxa03 of the english arbitration act state that the tribunal shall apply the law determined by the conflict of laws rules that it considers applicable 81 in practice as arbitrators must provide reasons for their decisions they often resort to pil rules to determine the law applicable in the absence of a choice judicial setting 82 in determining the law applicable in the absence of a choice state courts apply the pil rules of the forum which may be international supranational or domestic rules it should be noted that the majority of domestic pil systems do not authorize the adjudicator to apply transnational nonstate law to govern the 39 it is important to note that the choice can be made expressly or tacitly the determination of such choice depends on the applicable law see for example hcch principles artxa04 iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 21 contract in the absence of a choice however this has not prevented state courts from referring to nonstate law for other purposes for example interpretation of the applicable state law or filling gaps in that law40 uniform pil instruments 83 in the absence of the parties choice the hcch 1955 sales of goods conven tion applies the main rule that the law of the country in which the sellers business establishment or habitual residence is located at the time of receipt of the buyers order will govern the contract of sale artxa03 should the seller have more than one business establishment in different countries the business establishment receiving the order is the relevant one a similar approach has been adopted in the hcch 1986 sales convention articlexa08 of which provides for additional connecting factors in terms of the hcch 1978 agency convention three main connecting factors have a claim to apply to the agency relationship between the principal and the agent in a situation in which both parties have their own business establishment a the law of the state in which the agent acts b the law of the state in which the busi ness establishment of the principal is located and c the law of the state in which the business establishment of the agent is located artxa06 84 the mexico convention adopts a general criterion to be followed by the judge in determining the governing law according to articlexa09 the contract shall be governed by the law of the state with which it has the closest ties in determin ing the law applicable under this provision the court must take into account not only the objective and subjective elements of the contract but also general prin ciples of international commercial law recognized by international organizations such as the upicc 85 the rome i regulation presents a complex regime for determining the law applicable in the absence of a choice pursuing the goal of legal certainty the regu lation sets out in articles 4 to 8 a variety of rules relating to specific contracts such as sale of goods provision of services franchise and distribution agreements con tracts of carriage consumer and insurance contracts and individual employment contracts for example articlexa04 paragraphxa01 a of the regulation states that the sale of goods shall be governed by the law of the country in which the habitual residence of the seller is located41 in that case under articlexa01 paragraphxa01xa0b of the cisg the cisg applies when the habitual residence of the seller is in a state that is a party to the cisg unless that state has lodged a declaration that articlexa01 paragraphxa01 b does not apply 40 see parasxa0351353 below and for case law see the unilex database 41 the place of habitual residence is defined in articlexa019 of the rome i regulation 22 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 86 articlexa04 paragraphs 24 of the rome i regulation lays down general rules based on characteristic performance of the contract or closest connections to deter mine the law applicable in the absence of a choice 87 the hcch principles do not cover situations in which the parties have not chosen the law applicable to the contract in the light of the diversity of rules regarding this subject there is currently no international consensus with the exception of the hcch 1955 sales of goods convention with respect to the rules that determine the applicable law in the absence of a choice national laws 88 determination of the law applicable in the absence of a choice may result in different solutions according to the choice of law rules employed by the adjudica tor in this context some jurisdictions have more flexibility than others 89 for example certain jurisdictions apply the law of the place of performance as the governing law lex loci executionis whereas others apply the law of the country where the contract has been concluded lex loci celebrationis others apply subsidiary connecting factors in cases where these factors cannot be determined 90 most modern legal systems have a more flexible rule to the effect that the law of the jurisdiction of closest connection should govern the contract however they differ on what is meant by the closest connection some national laws estab lish a number of factors to be taken into account while others presume the closest connection to be the law of the habitual residence of the party having to perform the characteristic obligation other legal systems presume the closest connection to be the place of the conclusion of the contract or the place of performance of the contract iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 23 c mandatory rules and public policy are there limits on the application of the law chosenxa0byxa0thexa0parties 91 as indicated above parties to contracts of sale are generally free to choose the law governing the contract and to agree on their terms however the application of the parties chosen law may be limited by mandatory rules and public policy 92 in pil overriding mandatory rules should be distinguished from ordinary mandatory rules of contract law ie those that cannot be derogated from by agree ment in that they represent rules of fundamental importance in the legal system in which they operate while ordinary mandatory rules apply only to the extent that they are part of the applicable law overriding mandatory rules apply irrespec tive of the law otherwise applicable to the contract 93 overriding mandatory rules are legal provisions enacted by a state contained in an international treaty or emanating from a supranational body for example articlexa0101 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union and applicable irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract these rules vary from one system to another as they relate to sensitive issues deserving special protection or regulation eg consumer protection competition law currency and corruption therefore overriding mandatory rules establish important limitations to the principle of party autonomy and may prevent forum shopping in sensitive areas however mandatory rules are seldom explicitly identified as such often case law identifies which rules are mandatory in some jurisdictions the notion of mandatory rules is unknown or unused however judges achieve the same result by using doctrine that allows the court to decline the application of laws that violate public policy these limitations may in practice hinder legal predictability if judicial precedents inter preting a certain legal provision do not exist or are not easily accessible 94 the notion of public policy ordre public expresses a mechanism protecting the basic values of the forums legal system against the application of a foreign law by preventing the application of a foreign law chosen by the parties or deter mined in accordance with pil rules the public policy exception produces effects similar to those of overriding mandatory rules under the public policy exception the application of a foreign law is barred by the adjudicator on the grounds that its application in the particular case would be inconsistent or repugnant to the fundamental policies of the forum or another legal system whose law would apply to the contract in the absence of the parties choice it is an exceptional yet neces sary device to avoid results which may offend a countrys fundamental concepts of social economic or political justice 24 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 95 many international or regional pil instruments deal with both overriding mandatory rules and public policy 96 articlexa011 of the mexico convention contains a general rule stating that the provisions of the law of the forum must be applied when they are mandatory require ments it also establishes the adjudicators discretion to decide on the application of mandatory provisions of the law of another state with which the contract has close ties 97 articlexa018 of the mexico convention allows for the exclusion of the applica tion of the law designated by the convention when it is manifestly contrary to the public order of the forum 98 articlexa09 paragraphxa01 of the rome i regulation has further elaborated on the notion of mandatory rules namely overriding mandatory provisions respect for the provisions is regarded as crucial by a country in order to safeguard its public interests such as its political social or economic organization the provisions are applicable to any situation falling within their scope irrespective of the law other wise applicable to the contract articlexa09 paragraphxa03 of the regulation allows for the exceptional application of the overriding mandatory provisions of a third coun try provided that the obligations arising out of the contract have to be or have been performed in that country and that those overriding mandatory provisions render the performance of the contract unlawful 99 articlexa021 of the rome i regulation states that the application of a provision of the law of any country specified by this regulation may be refused only if such applica tion is manifestly incompatible with the public policy ordre public of the forum 100 articlexa011 of the hcch principles establishes the exceptional circumstances in which the parties choice of the governing law can be limited articlexa011 para graphsxa01 and 2 addresses overriding mandatory provisions of law with paragraphxa01 establishing the forums discretion to apply its overriding mandatory provisions and paragraphxa02 indicating the circumstances in which the forum may apply mandatory provisions of another state articlexa011 paragraphs 3 and 4 addresses fundamental notions of public policy ordre public with paragraphxa0 3 establishing the forums discretion to exclude the application of the chosen law if it contravenes the forums fundamental notions of public policy and paragraphxa04 indicating the circumstances in which the forum may take into account fundamental notions of public policy of another state finally articlexa011 paragraphxa05 addresses the application of overriding mandatory provisions and public policy ordre public by arbitral tribunals 101 similar rules can be seen in other hcch choice of law instruments articlexa06 of the hcch 1955 sales of goods convention articles 16 and 17 of the hcch 1978 agency convention and articles 17 and 18 of the hcch 1986 sales convention iii determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts 25 102 the upicc contain in articlexa014 a broad rule addressing the prevalence of mandatory rules over the upicc it states that nothing in the upicc shall restrict the application of mandatory rules whether of national international or supranational origin which are applicable in accordance with the relevant pil rules see paraxa0341 below 103 the upicc in their articlexa015 use the term mandatory rules also in a different meaning referring to certain upicc internal provisions that cannot be derogated from or excluded by the parties see paraxa0389 below it is true that given the nonbinding character of the upicc the nonobservance of the manda tory provisions may have no consequences it is however considered an important guidance for contracting parties and adjudicators especially when the upicc are chosen as the governing law table 2 below sets out selected mandatory rules within the upicc and the cisg table 2 upicc and cisg selected mandatory rules selected mandatory rules within the upicc articlexa017 good faith and fair dealing articlexa0314 general provisions on validity articlexa05172 price determination articlexa074132 agreed payment for nonperformance articlexa01032 limitation periods mandatory rules within the cisg articlexa012a articlexa028 a see chapxa0iv sectxa0a below 104 articlexa09 of the electronic communications convention establishes mini mum standards for the functional equivalence between electronic communications and form requirements that may exist under the applicable law these form require ments may be considered of mandatory application in certain jurisdictions 105 the principle of party autonomy contained in articlexa0 3 of the electronic communications convention does not empower the parties to set aside statutory requirements on the form or authentication of contracts and transactions thus articlexa09 of the convention should not be understood as allowing the parties to go as far as relaxing statutory requirements on signature in favour of methods of authen tication that provide a lesser degree of reliability than electronic signatures 27 iv substantive law of internationalxa0 sales a united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods 1 scope of application bases for applying the cisg when is a sale international what contact or connection between the sales transaction and a contracting state will trigger the application of the cisg 106 the cisg is a hardlaw instrument applicable to the international sale of goods it is binding on parties judges and arbitrators when the conditions set out in the instrument itself and particularly in its articlexa0 1 paragraphxa0 1 are met a sale of goods is defined as international when the contracting parties have their places of business in different states if parties have more than one place of busi ness the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance no other test for example with regard to the nationality of the parties or to the civil or commercial character of the parties or of the contract is required to determine the internationality of the sales contract 107 the provisions in articlexa01 paragraphs 1 a and b describe the relation ship between the sales transaction and contracting state that triggers the application of the cisg the convention will apply if the states in which both parties have their places of business are contracting states or if pil rules lead to the application of the law of a contracting state 108 the application of the cisg may be excluded by agreement of the parties artxa0 6 moreover a contracting state may lodge a declaration under articlexa0 95 that excludes the application of the cisg through the application of pil rules42 42 for the status and text of the declarations made by contracting states to the cisg see the united nations treaty collection website 28 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 109 in accordance with articlexa01 paragraphxa02 when facts that would reveal that the sale is international are not apparent to the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract the internationality is to be ignored in determining whether the con vention applies thus for example when a sales contract is concluded by an agent for one party without disclosure that the principals place of business is in a different state from the other party the contract is not governed by the convention does the cisg always apply in a contracting state 110 exceptions to the application of the cisg may occur if the cisg is in force only in some territorial units of a contracting state artxa093 and if some contracting states have declared that they share the same or closely related legal rules on matters governed by the convention artxa094 currently the latter declaration applies to contracts concluded between parties having their place of business in denmark finland iceland norway or sweden what is a contract for sale under the cisg and what are goods under the cisg 111 most of the time what constitutes a contract for sale under the convention is obvious however there are circumstances in which more explanation or analysis is required the same applies to what constitutes goods under the cisg 112 articles 1 and 3 of the cisg identify transactions to which the convention applies a definition of a sales contract under the cisg is achieved by resorting to the provisions that typically characterize the obligations of the parties under the contract namely articles 30 and 53 of the cisg the seller has to deliver the goods and the buyer has to receive them and pay the agreed price 113 articlexa03 paragraphxa01 of the cisg expands upon the traditional definition of the sales contract found in certain legal traditions which characterizes the sellers obligation as an obligation to give dare as opposed to other contracts such as work services or construction contracts in which the obligation is an obligation to do facere under articlexa03 paragraphxa01 of the cisg the obligation of the seller is not solely characterized as an obligation to give but also includes an obligation to do the cisg thus considers as a sales contract a contract for the supply of goods to be manufactured or produced by the seller with materials provided by the seller or by the buyer if the latter does not provide a substantial part of the materials necessary for such manufacture or production 114 articlexa03 paragraphxa02 addresses the application of the cisg to mixed con tracts namely contracts for sales in which the sellers obligations include a duty to provide labour or other services as well as goods it provides that the convention iv substantive law of international sales 29 applies to such contracts unless the supply of labour or services constitutes the preponderant part of the obligations of the party that furnishes the goods how ever services or work needed to manufacture or produce the goods under articlexa03 paragraphxa01 do not count for the purpose of articlexa03 paragraphxa02 115 for the possible application of the cisg to distribution contracts see chapterxa0v section b below to barter or countertrade transactions see chapterxa0v sectionxa0e below 116 the use of new technologies has raised a number of issues regarding the substantive scope of the cisg in particular in the realm of computer software and data contracts with respect to software and data may raise issues as to whether they are contracts for sale or whether the subject matter of the sale is goods see chapxa0v sectxa0d below 117 six specific categories of international sales are excluded from the scope of the convention those mentioned in articlexa02 paragraphxa0a concern sale of goods to buyers who acquire them for personal family or household use in most countries such sales are characterized as consumer transactions and are governed by specific rules often of a mandatory nature articlexa02 paragraphs b and c relate to sales by auction or on execution or otherwise by authority of law which may raise issues regarding the formation of the contract and the sellers consent all these exclusions are based on the specific nature of the transaction the remaining exclusions artxa02 paras df are based on the nature of the goods under those paragraphs sales of shares and other securities as well as money sales of ships vessels hovercraft or aircraft and contracts for the sale of electricity are excluded from the scope of the convention however the supply of gas and oil and other energy sources are not excluded from the scope of the cisg by articlexa02 what matters are governed by the cisg 118 once the applicability of the cisg is decided the next issue to consider is what matters are governed by the cisg articles 4 and 5 deal expressly with this issue matters that are governed by the cisg are addressed exclusively by the express provisions or general principles underlying the cisg only when no provision or general principles can be found will the domestic law apply in accordance with articlexa07 see parasxa0127132 below 119 articlexa04 provides that the cisg governs two of the most important matters that arise in contracts of sale of goods the first is whether and when a contract has been concluded the second is the rights and obligations of the seller and buyer arising from the contract domestic law notions such as consideration and causa are not relevant for the cisg rights and obligations of third parties are not governed by the cisg 30 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 120 articlexa04 paragraphxa0a provides that the cisg is not concerned with two matters the first is the validity of the contract any of its provisions or any usage for the application of usages see paraxa0139 below under the cisg validity is to be distinguished from formation of the contracts the question of whether a con tract is to be invalidated arises only after a contract is concluded examples in domestic law of such invalidation rules include rules on public policy mistake fraud threat or incapacity43 121 the second matter with which the cisg is not concerned is the effect of the contract on the property in the goods sold artxa04 paraxa0b the question of how and when the property passes from the seller to the buyer is to be decided by the applicable domestic law 122 however there is an important exception to articlexa04 paragraphs a and b of the cisg articlexa04 provides that the cisg is not concerned with validity and property except as otherwise expressly provided in this convention for example some domestic legal systems may allow a contract to be invalidated owing to a mistake as to the quality of the goods however since the cisg has explicit rules on delivery of nonconforming goods the cisg governs this matter to the exclusion of domestic laws 123 the liability of the seller for death or personal injury caused by the goods to any person is not governed by the cisg artxa05 since death and personal injury deal with extracontractual interests they are issues that are better dealt with in accordance with the public policy decisions of each contracting state thus domestic rules on product liability between sellers and buyers apply even if the contract of sale is governed by the cisg as far as they concern death or personal injury this includes death or personal injury caused by labour or other services provided by the seller if that contract is a sales contract under articlexa0 3 paragraphxa0 2 of the cisg however sums paid by the buyer as compensation for the death or personal injury of a third person caused by goods or services supplied by the seller may be regarded as claims for pecuniary loss of the buyer can the cisg be chosen as governing sales law and what role can the upicc play in this context 124 under the principle of party autonomy parties may make the cisg appli cable when it would not otherwise apply opting in as nonstate law44 in such 43 the upicc filled this gap and contain a detailed set of provisions on the validity of contract including avoidance for mistake fraud and threat a provision on gross disparity a provision on illegality and express rules on restitution in the case of avoidance see parasxa0370372 below 44 for a more thorough discussion of this point see paragraphs 4061 above iv substantive law of international sales 31 cases the cisg will be regarded as a body of rules of law hcch principles artxa03 if the cisg would not apply on its own terms ie if the conditions of articlexa01 paragraphxa01 are not met its choice as applicable law would be limited by restrictions that pil rules may impose on the choice of nonstate rules of law to govern the contract see parasxa04547 above 125 under articlexa0 2 paragraphxa0 2 of the hcch principles the parties may choose more than one law to govern their contract accordingly the parties may choose both the cisg and the upicc as the governing laws in doing so the parties may refer to the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts depending on the choice made by the par ties the upicc may play the limited role of background law as opposed to the primary role played by the cisg45 can the parties derogate from the cisg or vary its rules 126 one of the underlying principles of the cisg is party autonomy as estab lished in articlexa06 the parties are free not only to exclude the convention but also to derogate from or vary the effect of its provisions at the time of or after the conclusion of the contract see however paraxa029 and table 2 above how is the cisg to be interpreted how are the gaps in the contract filled what are general principles within the cisg 127 articlexa07 provides a framework for the uniform and international interpreta tion of the cisg it is aimed at avoiding a distortive interpretation and application of the cisg resulting from interference with domestic laws case law and doctrinal traditions 128 the autonomous interpretative criterion is based upon the principles of inter nationality uniformity and good faith cisg artxa0 7 paraxa0 1 the autonomous gapfilling method is to be applied according to the same general principles inherent to the cisg cisg artxa07 para 2 129 similarly to the upicc see paraxa0387 below and other uniform texts the cisg pursues the goal of uniform interpretation terms and concepts used must be interpreted autonomously46 therefore the meaning of the vast majority of the 45 see in particular model clauses 3 a and b and paragraphs 6566 above 46 these principles apply to several uniform texts see for example comment 2 to articlexa016 of the upicc 32 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts cisg terms is to be found within the cisg and not in domestic laws in order to achieve the goal of uniform interpretation domestic courts and arbitral tribunals applying the cisg in different jurisdictions tend to consider cases issued by other courts when interpreting the cisg 130 articlexa07 minimizes the need to apply pil rules and rules of domestic sub stantive law when a question concerning a matter governed by the convention is not expressly settled in it the question is to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which the convention is based only in the absence of such principles is the interpreter referred to the domestic law determined by the choice of law rules hence recourse to domestic law is the last resort 131 in practice a significant number of general principles to be found within the cisg have been developed by case law 132 whether and to what extent external principles may play a role in filling gaps in the cisg in the absence of an agreement of the parties is an open issue in the case of the relationship between the cisg and the upicc the common understanding is that the upicc are not as such considered to be the general principles of the cisg but rather as being able to serve to corroborate the exist ence of a given general principle and thus they can be a tool to interpret the cisg cisg artxa07 paraxa01 or to fill its gaps cisg artxa07 paraxa02 whenever there is no conflict between the two instruments see parasxa0353 and 394 below what are the rules for the interpretation of the contract 133 articlexa08 of the cisg addresses interpretation of statements and other con duct of a party to a contract this article which displaces the application of domes tic laws on interpretation of such statements and conduct can play an important role in determining the meaning of a contract 134 articlexa08 paragraphxa01 of the cisg states a preference for the interpretation of unilateral statements and conduct in accordance with the intention of the party speaking or acting so long as the other party knew or could not have been unaware of the intent of the party speaking or acting 135 if the intention of the party speaking or acting is not known to the other party or the other party could not have been aware of that intent then under articlexa08 paragraphxa02 of the cisg the statements or conduct are to be interpreted in accordance with the understanding that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would have had in the same circumstances iv substantive law of international sales 33 136 articlexa08 paragraphxa03 of the cisg mandates a contextual approach to ascer taining the intent of a party or the understanding that a reasonable person would have it does so by requiring that due consideration be given to all relevant cir cumstances of the case including the negotiations any practices which the parties have established between themselves usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties 137 chapterxa04 of the upicc contains a more detailed set of rules on contractual interpretation articlexa041 contains a general provision on the interpretation of the contract according to the common intention of the parties or if a common inten tion cannot be established according to the meaning that reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties would give to it in the same circumstances articles 43 and 44 endorse the contextual approach followed by the cisg the upicc also expressly address additional issues such as the interpretation of terms supplied by one party through the contra proferentem rule linguistic discrepancies and supplying omitted terms see parasxa0373 and 394 below what is the role of practices and usages 138 the determination of the content of an international sale of goods contract is left to party autonomy that can shape its content in accordance with the needs of each specific transaction within the limits derived by mandatory rules in practice parties may draft a very long and detailed contract or exchange offer and accept ance indicating only the fundamental elements of the contract in any case the question is how gaps in the contract are to be filled 139 the cisg considers in this regard the importance of practices and usages articlexa09 of the cisg in the same way as articlexa019 of the upicc47 refers to three situations that are different in name content and effect a practices established between the parties b agreed usages and c usages and customs of international trade practices and agreed usages have a bilateral effect and are thus binding only to the extent that they are reflected in the habitual conduct of the parties in their business relationship or in the agreement of the parties concerned wellestablished and widely recognized international usages of trade enjoy a presumption of general knowledge and tacit acceptance as their existence is disconnected from a specific commercial operation 140 all three become an integral part of the contract and bind the parties usually during the formation of the contract either by express or implied agreement the rest of the terms of the contract would be filled by the cisg itself through its default provisions 47 on articlexa09 of the cisg and articlexa019 of the upicc see also paragraphxa0394 below 34 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 141 usages and practices have another important role within the cisg as an interpretative criterion for the contract artxa08 paraxa03 142 articlexa04 paragraphxa0a of the cisg excludes from the scope of the convention issues in regard to the validity of any usage what is the interplay between the cisg and the icc incoterms 143 the icc incoterms are a set of widely accepted definitions for the most commonly used terms of trade for the sale and purchase of goods they describe the allocation of certain obligations risks and costs between the buyer and the seller including with respect to import and export formalities and transport in contract practice the incoterms rules are incorporated into contracts for the sale of goods and help provide clarity and reduce uncertainties and risks for sellers and buyers 144 first published in 1936 by the icc the incoterms have been updated regu larly to reflect current trade practices the latest version is the incoterms 2020 145 the incoterms 2020 feature 11 rules seven of them exw fca cpt cip dap dpu and ddp are rules for any mode or modes of transport while the remaining four fas fob cfr and cif are rules for sea and inland waterway transport a ex works exw means that the seller delivers when it places the goods at the disposal of the buyer at the sellers premises or at another named place works factory warehouse etc the seller does not need to load the goods onto any col lecting vehicle or clear the goods for export where such clearance is applicable b free carrier fca means that the seller delivers the goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the buyer at the sellers premises or another named place the parties are well advised to specify as clearly as possible the point within the named place of delivery as the risk passes to the buyer at that point c carriage paid to cpt means that the seller delivers the goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the seller at an agreed place if any such place is agreed between parties and that the seller must arrange or contract for and pay the costs of carriage necessary to bring the goods to the named place of destination d carriage and insurance paid to cip means that the seller delivers the goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the seller at an agreed place if any such place is agreed between parties and that the seller must arrange or contract for and pay the costs of carriage necessary to bring the goods to the named place of destination the seller also contracts for insurance cover against the buyers risk of iv substantive law of international sales 35 loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage the buyer should note that under cip the seller is now required to obtain insurance of a higher level than in the past in line with the institute cargo clauses a or similar clauses buyers wishing to have more insurance protection have to either expressly agree as much with the sellers or make their own extra insurance arrangements e delivered at place dap means that the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination the seller bears all risks involved in bringing the goods to the named place f delivered at place unloaded dpu means that the seller delivers when the goods once unloaded from the arriving means of transport are placed at the disposal of the buyer at a named place of destination the seller bears all risks in volved in bringing the goods to and unloading them at the place of destination g delivered duty paid ddp means that the seller delivers the goods when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer cleared for import on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination the seller bears all the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods to the place of destination and has an obligation to clear the goods not only for export but also for import to pay any duty for both export and import and to carry out all customs formalities h free alongside ship fas means that the seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the vessel eg on a quay or a barge nominated by the buyer at the named port of shipment the risk of loss of or damage to the goods passes when the goods are alongside the ship and the buyer bears all costs from that moment onwards i free on board fob means that the seller delivers the goods on board the vessel nominated by the buyer at the named port of shipment or procures the goods already so delivered the risk of loss of or damage to the goods passes when the goods are on board the vessel and the buyer bears all costs from that moment onwards j cost and freight cfr means that the seller delivers the goods on board the vessel or procures the goods already so delivered the risk of loss of or damage to the goods passes when the goods are on board the vessel the seller must contract for and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination k cost insurance and freight cif means that the seller delivers the goods on board the vessel or procures the goods already so delivered the risk of loss of or damage to the goods passes when the goods are on board the vessel the seller must contract for and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination the seller also contracts for insurance cover against the buyers 36 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts risk of loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage the buyer should note that under cif the seller is required to obtain insurance only on minimum cover buyers wishing to have more insurance protection have to either expressly agree as much with the sellers or to make their own extra insurance arrangements 146 under the cisg the icc incoterms have been considered both as agreed usages and practices established between the parties and as trade usages there is an important interplay between the cisg and the incoterms with regard to delivery passing of risk and payment the use of the incoterms does not entirely displace the cisg rules on the passing of the risk as it is only a partial derogation of the cisg artxa0 6 in addition the incoterms do not deal with among others the formation of the contract the buyers payment obligations or most notably remedies for breach of contract 147 trade terms may also be defined differently from the icc incoterms with respect to business sectors or in domestic law48 it is therefore advisable to correctly identify the intended trade term how can the place of business be determined under the cisg 148 as the cisg refers to a partys place of business in several provisions49 defining which of the partys multiple places of business is the main place of business is relevant to promote legal certainty and predictability in applying the convention 149 according to articlexa010 paragraphxa0a if a party has more than one place of business the relevant place of business for the purposes of the convention is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance thus if the party has multiple places of business it is not always the principal one that is relevant in determining whether a contract is governed by the cisg50 when the party does not have a place of business reference is to be made to habitual residence rather than to domicile 150 by way of example articlexa010 of the cisg has been interpreted to consider the sellers relevant place of business to be the construction site where the contract had been concluded and where the equipment was to be picked up by the buyer51 48 for example the united states uniform commercial code articlexa02 paragraphxa0320 defines the trade term cif 49 arts 1 12 20 paraxa02 24 31 paraxa0c 42 paraxa01 b 57 paraxa01 a 69 paraxa02 and 96 50 clout system case noxa0261 bezirksgericht der saane switzerland 20 february 1997 51 clout system case noxa0746 oberlandesgericht graz austria 29 july 2004 iv substantive law of international sales 37 does the cisg have any form requirements 151 the cisg does not require any particular form such as in writing or any special requirements such as a signature for the conclusion of the contract 152 form as considered in the cisg has its own autonomous and uniform meaning thus even if the issue of form is a matter of validity under domestic law articlexa011 prevails and the domestic requirements such as the statute of frauds or any other form requirement are irrelevant 153 the principle of freedom of evidence also applies and the contract can be evidenced by any means including witnesses thus displacing domestic evidentiary rules such as those that exclude oral testimony parole evidence rule 154 the weight to be given to the evidence is a matter to be left to the judge or arbitrator and thus the probative value of the evidence is to be assessed in accord ance with the procedural laws or rules of law and on a casebycase basis 155 parties might well expressly or impliedly agree on the exclusion or derogation of the principle of informality under articlexa011 of the cisg by virtue of articlexa06 of the cisg or by a nooralmodification nom clause that excludes oral agreements for the modification of the contract artxa029 nom clauses are expressly referred to in the upicc which contain specific provisions on them see paraxa0395 below 156 states may lodge a declaration under articlexa096 of the cisg the effect of which is to trigger the application of articlexa0 12 and therefore the written form requirement the articlexa096 declaration applies to articlexa011 to the communications in part ii relating to the formation of the contract arts 1424 and to the modi fication and termination of the contract by agreement artxa029 with respect to the form of the contract and of other communications and also with regard to their evidence when and how is a contract concluded under the cisg 157 part ii of the cisg regulates the formation of an international sales contract considering rules for the offer arts 1417 and acceptance arts 182252 a con tract is concluded when an acceptance of an offer becomes effective by reaching 52 the cisg provisions on the formation of the contract and particularly those relating to the offer and the acceptance are among those provisions which were followed in the upicc with no or limited adaptations however specific rules for matters not expressly dealt with in the cisg such as writings in confirmation contracts with terms deliberately left open and incorporation of standard terms were introduced in the upicc there are also rules covering bad faith and breaches of confidentiality during the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of the contract see parasxa0368 and 394397 below 38 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts the offeror arts 23 and 24 there are no rules for determining the place of con clusion of the contract and thus this issue is left to the otherwise applicable law 158 part ii applies when offer and acceptance may not be easily identified it applies also to the modification of the contract and its avoidance termination following the offer and acceptance process when is a proposal to conclude a contract an offer 159 under the cisg in order for a proposal for concluding a contract to con stitute an offer it must be addressed to one or more specific persons and it must be sufficiently definite for an offer to be considered sufficiently definite it must indicate the goods and expressly or implicitly fix or make provisions for determin ing the quantity and the price artxa014 paraxa01 offers to the general public are considered an invitation to make an offer unless the contrary is clearly indicated by the person making the proposal artxa014 paraxa02 160 under the cisg the parties may agree that the contract is concluded only when certain specific matters are agreed besides those considered under articlexa014 paragraphxa01 of the cisg is an openprice contract valid under the cisg 161 articlexa014 of the cisg indicates that the price must be determined in the offer while articlexa055 of the cisg establishes a method to determine this element by applying the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under comparable circumstances in the trade concerned in the case of openprice contracts the apparent contradiction between articles 14 and 55 of the cisg is usually solved by the performance of the contract instances in which the contract has not been performed may be problematic can an offer be withdrawn or revoked 162 the cisg distinguishes between withdrawal artxa015 revocation artxa016 and termination artxa017 of the offer the offer also expires when it is not accepted within the time fixed or if no time is fixed within a reasonable time artxa0 18 paraxa02 163 an acceptance is the positive response to an offer it must be made clearly and unconditionally by the acceptor acceptance can take place by means of a statement conduct or in qualified circumstances silence or inaction artxa0 18 paraxa01 iv substantive law of international sales 39 164 unless the offeror sets out a specific form of acceptance the offeree is free to accept the offer either orally in person over the phone etc or in writing including by electronic means a letter telegram telex fax email etc in both circumstances for the acceptance to be effective and in turn the contract be con cluded it must reach the offeror within the time period established in the offer or in the absence of such provision within a reasonable time artxa018 paraxa02 165 in the case of oral offers the cisg requires that the acceptance be immediate unless the circumstances indicate otherwise artxa018 paraxa02 166 acceptance can also take place by means of conduct or by acts of perfor mance when acceptance occurs by conduct such as raising a hand and nodding ones head the contract is concluded when notice of such conduct reaches the offeror ie when the offeror learns of it if the acceptance takes place through acts of performance for example by delivering the goods and paying the price it is not necessary to make a notification of acceptance since the very act of delivery or payment concludes the contract as long as it is made within the time set by the offeror for acceptance or within a reasonable time if no such period is set never theless to be able to accept through acts of performance without the need for sending a communication to the offeror it is necessary that the offer allows for such ie begin manufacturing send immediately buy in my name without delay or make payment to my account number or that it is permitted by virtue of established practices of the contracting parties or by usage artxa018 paraxa03 167 an acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror be fore or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective artxa022 can an offer be accepted by silence or inaction 168 silence or inactivity do not in themselves amount to acceptance artxa018 paraxa02 however silence or inactivity along with other factors could amount to an acceptance of the offer this may happen by application of a legal provision arts 19 paraxa02 and 21 by application of a usage of trade or of a practice estab lished between the parties artxa09 or where in some circumstances the silence of the addressee of a letter of confirmation that purports to modify an oral contract might amount to an acceptance what is a counteroffer 169 a frequent problem in contract formation arises out of a reply to an offer that purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms articlexa019 of the cisg makes a distinction between those terms that materially alter the terms of the offer counteroffer and those that do not acceptance 40 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 170 in order to determine when an element that is introduced in an acceptance materially alters the offer thereby preventing the conclusion of the contract or not the following list of elements is provided in the cisg price quality and quantity of merchandise place and time of delivery the extent of one partys liability to the other and the settlement of disputes 171 although the cisg does not have special rules dealing with the use of standard terms namely provisions prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party and which are actually used without negotiation with the other party as defined in articlexa02119 paragraphxa02 of the upicc case law has generally considered the use of standard terms under the cisg mainly its articles 8 and 1424 in relation to the question of whether the standard terms are incorporated into the contract does the cisg govern the battle of the forms 172 although the cisg does not contain an express provision on the issue known as battle of the forms it is generally accepted that it is a matter governed by it the battle of the forms refers to a situation in which the parties exchange general conditions preprinted forms that add one or more terms that materially modify the offer the general conditions in the two forms generally contain con tradictions and in the case of dispute the question arises of whether a contract has been concluded and if so what the terms of that contract are if a contract has been validly concluded the rules most commonly applied to address the battle of the forms are the lastshot rule namely the last form used by the parties prevails and the knockout rule according to which contradictory clauses contained in the standard forms are out of the content of the contract which is the solution expressly adopted in articlexa02122 of the upicc it has not been settled in case law applying the cisg which one of these two solutions should prevail53 how is the contract modified 173 under the cisg a contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties artxa029 paraxa01 modification and termination generally follow the same pattern of contract conclusion namely offer and acceptance and domestic law concepts such as consideration are not relevant in this area if a nom clause see paraxa0155 above is included within the contract it may not be orally modified or terminated by agreement however the conduct of one party may preclude that party from asserting such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied on that conduct artxa029 paraxa02 53 see uncitral digest of case law on the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods articlexa019 iv substantive law of international sales 41 2 obligations of the parties including passing of risk and preservation of goods 174 part iii chapters ii and iii of the cisg adopt a simple structure of defining the obligations of the parties and then providing remedies available for the other party in the case of breach of any of those obligations the obligations of the seller are listed in articlexa030 and elaborated upon in articles 31 to 44 which also include provisions on the buyers duty to examine the goods and to give notice of lack of conformity of the goods to the seller arts 3844 the obligations of the buyer are listed in articlexa053 and further elaborated upon in articles 54 to 60 175 the question of when the risk of loss passes from the seller to the buyer is closely related to the sellers obligation because it defines whether a loss of or damage to the goods amounts to a breach of the sellers obligation part iii chapterxa0iv of the cisg deals with the question of passing of risk in addition the seller or buyer may be required to preserve the goods when risk of loss is on the other party rules on the duty to preserve the goods are provided in part iii chapterxa0v section vi 176 in practice parties often use shorthand trade terms such as fca fob cpt and cif to indicate the allocation of certain obligations risks and costs as between the seller and buyer under the contract in accordance with the icc incoterms which provide definitions for exw e terms fca fas and fob fxa0terms cpt cip cfr and cif c terms and dap dpu and ddp d terms for the interplay between the cisg and the icc incoterms in general see paragraphxa0146 above what are the obligations of the seller under the cisg 177 the general obligations of the seller are to deliver the goods hand over any documents relating to the goods and transfer the property in the goods as required by the contract and the cisg artxa030 the obligation to deliver the goods includes obligations to deliver goods that are in conformity with the contract and to deliver goods that are free from any right or claim of third parties where should the goods be delivered and how are there special rules for a contract involving carriage of goods 178 in international sale of goods the parties often agree to engage independent carriers for the delivery of goods these arrangements are known as sales that involve carriage of goods in such cases the seller is obligated to hand the goods over to a carrier at a certain place and the buyer is obligated to take delivery of the goods from the carrier at the destination of the carriage which is not necessarily the same location as the buyers place of business if the seller agrees in the contract 42 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts to deliver at the buyers place of business that is not a contract involving carriage of goods for the purpose of the cisg even if the seller engages an independent carrier this is because in this case the sellers obligation to deliver is not fulfilled by handing the goods over to an independent carrier but by placing the goods at the buyers disposal at the buyers place of business 179 the rights and obligations of the carrier and consignor or the holder of transport documents eg bills of lading are not governed by the cisg see artxa04 they are governed by the law applicable to the contract of carriage or the bills of lading in most cases regarding international carriage of goods uniform laws are applicable for carriage by sea they are either the haguevisby rules regime established by the international convention for the unification of certain rules of law relating to bills of lading 1924 the 1924 brussels convention54 and various protocols amending it55 or the hamburg rules regime established by the unitedxa0 nations convention on the carriage of goods by sea 197856 for international carriage by air the most relevant instrument is the convention for the unification of certain rules for international carriage by air 1999 montreal convention57 uniform law instruments relating to land and inland waterway transport include the convention on the contract for the international carriage of goods by road 1956 cmr58 the budapest convention on the contract for the carriage of goods by inland waterway 2001 cmni59 and the uniform rules concerning the contract of inter national carriage of goods by rail cim which are under the framework of the convention concerning international carriage by rail 1980 cotif60 180 under the cisg if the contract of sale involves carriage of goods the sellers obligation is to hand over the goods to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer artxa0 31 paraxa0 a once this is done the obligation of the seller to deliver the goods has been fulfilled except that the seller must further give the buyer notice of the consignment specifying the goods if the goods are not clearly identified to the contract by markings on the goods shipping documents or otherwise artxa032 paraxa01 the duty to give notice of consignment under articlexa032 paragraphxa01 also applies when it is the buyer that arranges for the carriage if the sellers delivery obligation consists of handing over the goods to the carrier eg

in practice parties often agree on a different place eg port of shipment where the goods are to be handed over to a carrier whether it is the first carrier or not this is done either by use of trade terms such as the icc incoterms fca fob cfr or cif or otherwise in such cases that agreement prevails artxa06 182 when the contract of sale involves carriage of goods there is also the ques tion of who arranges for the contract of carriage and insurance in respect of the carriage of the goods the cisg does not directly answer these questions 183 however the cisg provides that if the seller is bound by the contract to arrange for the carriage of the goods the seller must make such contracts as are necessary for carriage to the place fixed by means of transportation appropriate in the circumstances and according to the usual terms for such transportation artxa032 paraxa02 184 the icc incoterms clarify when the seller has the obligation to arrange for the contract of carriage ie c terms and when it does not ie f terms when the seller is bound to arrange for the contract of carriage the incoterms rules provide that the contract of carriage must be made on usual terms at the sellers cost and provide for carriage by the usual route in the customary manner normally used for carriage of the type of goods sold when the seller is not bound to arrange for the contract of carriage the seller must provide the buyer with the information that the buyer needs for arranging the carriage 185 with respect to insurance if the seller is not bound to effect insurance in respect of the carriage of the goods the seller must at the buyers request provide the buyer with all available information necessary to enable the buyer to effect such insurance artxa032 paraxa03 this applies irrespective of whether it is the seller or the buyer who arranges for the carriage 186 according to the icc incoterms the seller must obtain cargo insurance under cip and cif terms but not under other trade terms under other terms relating to sale involving carriage f terms and cpt and cfr the seller has no obligation to make a contract of insurance but must provide the buyer with the information that the buyer needs to obtain insurance 187 if the contract of sale does not involve carriage of goods the seller is obli gated to deliver the goods by placing them at the buyers disposal the seller fulfils the obligation to place the goods at the buyers disposal by doing everything possible to enable the buyer to take over ie to take possession of the goods 188 the place at which the goods are to be placed at the buyers disposal de pends on the following distinction in principle that place is the place of business 44 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts of the seller at the time of the conclusion of the contract artxa031 paraxa0c how ever if a the contract relates to specific goods or unidentified goods to be drawn from a specific stock or to be manufactured and b the parties knew at the time of the conclusion of the contract that the goods were at a particular place or that the goods were to be manufactured or produced at a particular place the place of placing the goods at the buyers disposal is that place artxa0 31 paraxa0 b if the parties agree on a different place of delivery that agreement prevails artxa06 189 if the parties use e or d terms according to the incoterms rule they have agreed on a different place of delivery for contract not involving carriage cost of delivery 190 although the cisg does not have an express provision on bearing of cost of performance the relevant trade usage artxa09 or the general principle under lying the cisg artxa07 paraxa02 is that the cost of delivery must be borne by the seller unless otherwise agreed by the parties this rule corresponds to the provision contained in the upicc on cost of performance artxa0611161 the seller bears the costs necessary for delivery eg packaging measuring weighing the goods the seller bears the costs of transportation only to the place of delivery if the sellers obligation to deliver is to hand the goods over to the first carrier artxa031 paraxa0a the seller does not bear the transportation cost beyond that point like wise if the buyer is to collect the goods at a particular place artxa031 parasxa0b and c the seller does not bear the cost of transportation beyond that place 191 the icc incoterms contain more specific rules on the allocation of various costs relating to delivery or transport documents export and import clearance and checking packaging and marking of goods when should the goods be delivered 192 under the cisg if there is a date of delivery fixed by the contract or deter minable from the contract the seller is obligated to deliver on that date artxa033 paraxa0a if there is a period of time for delivery that is fixed by the contract or determinable from the contract the seller is obligated to deliver within that period but may deliver at any time within that period unless circumstances indicate that the buyer is to choose a date artxa033 paraxa0b in any other case the seller must deliver within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract artxa0 33 paraxa0c 61 articlexa06111 of the upicc indicates that parties shall bear the costs of the performance of the respective obligations unless otherwise agreed iv substantive law of international sales 45 late delivery 193 if the seller does not deliver by or on those dates the seller is in breach of the contract it is not necessary for the buyer to demand delivery to put the seller in breach early delivery 194 delivery earlier than the fixed date or period for delivery is also a breach of the sellers obligation even if the buyer takes delivery of the goods artxa0 52 paraxa01 sellers obligation to deliver conforming goods 195 the goods that the seller delivers must be of the quantity quality and descrip tion required by the contract the goods must also be contained or packaged in the manner required by the contract artxa035 paraxa01 packaging is particularly impor tant in international sale of goods in order to protect the goods from loss or damage during shipment thus the incoterms rules also generally consider packaging in the manner appropriate for transport to be the obligation of the seller quantity 196 with respect to quantity the delivery of not only a quantity smaller than that provided for by the contract but also a quantity greater than that provided for by the contract constitutes lack of conformity the seller is still in breach even if the buyer takes delivery of the excess quantity in that case the buyer must pay for the excess quantity it took at the contract rate artxa052 paraxa02 but the buyer is also entitled to remedies such as damages for loss caused by the excess delivery quality 197 if the parties have not agreed on the quality of the goods conformity is determined according to certain criteria the goods do not conform to the contract unless they a are fit for the purposes for which goods of the same description would ordinarily be used fitness for ordinary purpose artxa035 paraxa02 a b are fit for any particular purpose expressly or impliedly made known to the seller at the time of the conclusion of the contract fitness for particular purpose artxa0 35 paraxa02 b or c possess the qualities of goods which the seller has held out to the buyer as a sample or model artxa035 paraxa02 c the rule in articlexa035 para graphxa02 b does not apply when the circumstances show that the buyer did not rely on the sellers skill or judgment eg if the buyer made the choice or that it was unreasonable for the buyer to rely on the sellers skill and judgment eg the 46 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts seller did not claim to be an expert however the seller is not liable under arti clexa035 paragraphxa02 ac for any lack of conformity if at the time of the conclusion of the contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack of conformity artxa035 paraxa03 packaging 198 likewise it is possible that the parties have not agreed on the manner of how the goods are to be contained or packaged in that case the goods do not conform with the contract unless they are contained or packaged in the manner usual for such goods or where there is no such manner in a manner adequate to preserve and protect the goods artxa0 35 paraxa0 2 d however the seller is not liable under articlexa035 paraxa02 d for any lack of conformity of the packaging if at the time of the conclusion of the contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack of conformity artxa035 paraxa03 199 in practice depending on the flexibility of contract interpretation artxa08 the determination based on articlexa0 35 paragraphs 1 and 2 can be blurred it is more advantageous for the buyer to rely on articlexa035 paragraphxa01 because the seller is not liable under articlexa035 paragraphxa02 for any lack of conformity of the goods if at the time of the conclusion of the contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack of conformity artxa035 paraxa03 relevant time for determination of conformity 200 the relevant time for determination of conformity is the time when the risk passes to the buyer artxa036 paraxa01 the time of passing of risk is determined accord ing to articles 67 to 69 or according to the parties agreement eg inclusion of trade terms according to the incoterms it is not necessary for the lack of conformity to be apparent at the time of passing of risk its existence may be discovered later 201 lack of conformity which occurs after the passing of risk can also give rise to the sellers liability this is when the lack of conformity was due to a breach of any of the sellers obligations artxa036 paraxa02 typically this is the case if the lack of conformity occurred notwithstanding a guarantee by the seller that for a period of time the goods would remain fit for their ordinary purpose or for some particular purpose or would retain specified qualities or characteristics sellers right to cure 202 the seller has a right to cure lack of conformity if the seller has delivered goods before the date for delivery the seller may up to that date deliver any missing part or make up any deficiency in the quantity of the goods delivered or iv substantive law of international sales 47 deliver goods in replacement of any nonconforming goods delivered or remedy any lack of conformity in the goods delivered provided that the exercise of this right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense artxa037 the seller has a similar right to cure after the delivery date artxa048 203 however even if the seller cures the lack of conformity it does not change the fact that the delivered goods lacked conformity and therefore the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in the cisg arts 37 and 48 paraxa01 204 the upicc contain a provision on the right to cure by the nonperforming party in articlexa0714 that is couched in more general terms so as to apply to all contracts it lists the conditions and limits under which cure is admitted and clari fies the relationship with the exercise of other remedies see paraxa0379 below what should the buyer do to preserve rights deriving from nonconformityxa0of the goods 205 the buyer must examine the goods or cause them to be examined within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances artxa038 paraxa01 generally the period commences when the seller delivers the goods however if the contract involves carriage of the goods examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at their destination artxa0 38 paraxa0 2 in addition if the goods are redirected in transit or redispatched by the buyer without a reasonable opportunity for examination and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew or ought to have known of the possibility of redirection or redispatch examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at the new destination artxa038 paraxa03 206 there is no independent sanction for not conducting this examination how ever failure to examine the goods may lead to grave results for the buyer articlexa038 is to be read in conjunction with articlexa039 explained in paragraphsxa0207209 below that deprives the buyer of any right to remedy for lack of conformity if the buyer does not give notice to the seller namely the time that the buyer should have examined the goods under articlexa038 is the time under articlexa039 paragraphxa01 that the buyer ought to have discovered the lack of conformity the length of as short a period as practicable in the circumstances depends on various factors such as giving reasonable opportunity to the buyer to examine the goods the nature of the goods for example perishable or durable seasonal or not the frequency of the transaction and practices established between the parties and usages 207 the buyer has a duty to give notice to the seller of any lack of conformity of the goods buyers lose all the rights to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods if they do not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the lack of 48 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts conformity within a reasonable time after they have discovered the lack of conformity or ought to have discovered it artxa0 39 paraxa0 1 the determination of what is a reasonable period of time depends on various factors see paraxa0206 above there is also an absolute cutoff period of two years from the date when the goods were actually handed over to the buyer artxa039 paraxa02 this cutoff period applies even if the buyer could not have discovered a hidden lack of conformity within that period however the parties may extend or shorten the twoyear time limit by agree ing on a different contractual period of guarantee artxa039 paraxa02 these time limits are not to be confused with the limitation period which concerns the period within which legal proceedings need to be commenced see chapterxa0iv section b below on the limitation convention 208 the main purpose of giving notice to the seller is to enable the seller to cure the lack of conformity thus if the lack of conformity relates to facts of which the seller knew or could not have been unaware and which the seller did not disclose to the buyer the seller cannot rely on the buyers failure to give notice in accordance with articlexa039 artxa040 209 the rigidity of the duty of examination and notification is somewhat eased by an exception provided in articlexa044 if buyers have a reasonable excuse for their failure to give the required notice they may still resort to price reduction in accord ance with articlexa050 or claim damages except for loss of profit however it should be noted that this exception does not apply to the twoyear time limit under articlexa039 paragraphxa02 therefore the twoyear time limit is absolute is the seller obliged to deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party what are the buyers duties in this respect 210 the seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party unless the buyer agreed to take the goods subject to that right or claim artxa0 41 the right or claim of a third party under articlexa0 41 includes property rights such as ownership ie sale of third partys property or security rights that hinder the use or disposal of the goods by the buyer but not intellectual property which is dealt with under articlexa042 the right or claim of a third party need not be substantiated thus even if the buyer acquires full ownership of the goods accord ing to domestic property law protecting good faith purchasers the seller is still liable under the cisg if the owner makes any claim against the buyer this is because particularly in international sales the buyer should not be expected to deal with third parties which are usually in a foreign state iv substantive law of international sales 49 211 the seller is obligated to deliver goods that are free from rights of a third party that existed at the time of delivery thirdparty claims include those raised only after the time of delivery as long as they are based on rights that existed at the time of delivery intellectual property 212 if the right or claim of the third party is based on industrial property or other intellectual property the sellers obligation is governed by articlexa042 as is the case with other rights or claims under articlexa041 the seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party based on intellectual prop erty however the nature of intellectual property requires special treatment 213 although intellectual property rules are increasingly being harmonized under world intellectual property organization treaties owing to the principle of territoriality in intellectual property law infringement of intellectual property could still be determined differently according to the laws of each state thus it is par ticularly significant in the international sale of goods to ascertain which law is to be used to determine whether the seller has fulfilled the obligation to deliver goods free from a third partys right or claim based on intellectual property the cisg provides that it is the law of the state in which the goods will be resold or other wise used if it was contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract that the goods would be resold or otherwise used in that state artxa042 paraxa01 a if such use was not contemplated by the parties it is the law of the state in which the place of business of the buyer is located artxa042 paraxa01 b 214 the seller is obligated to deliver goods that are free from any right or claim based on intellectual property of a third party that existed at the time of delivery however the liability is limited only for intellectual property rights of which the seller knew or could not have been unaware at the time of the conclusion of the contract artxa0 42 paraxa0 1 this is a requirement unique to intellectual property that does not exist under articlexa041 215 furthermore the obligation of the seller to deliver goods free from any right or claim based on intellectual property of a third party does not extend to cases in which a the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of the right or claim at the time of the conclusion of the contract or b the right or claim results from the sellers compliance with technical drawings designs formulae or other such specifications furnished by the buyer artxa042 paraxa02 216 as is the case in lack of conformity regarding quantity quality or description of goods buyers lose the right to rely on the provisions of articlexa041 or 42 if they do not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the right or claim of the 50 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts third party within a reasonable time after they have become aware or ought to have become aware of the right or claim artxa043 paraxa01 217 the seller is not entitled to rely on the buyers failure to give timely notice if the seller knew of the right or claim of the third party and the nature of it artxa043 paraxa02 there is also the same exception that the buyer may still resort to price reduction in accordance with articlexa050 or claim damages except for loss of profit if the buyer has a reasonable excuse for failure to give the required notice artxa044 however unlike the case of lack of conformity regarding quantity quality or descrip tion of the goods the buyer has no duty of examination artxa038 and is not subject to the twoyear time limit to give notice artxa039 paraxa02 does the seller have other obligations handing over of documents transfer of ownership 218 the seller must hand over any documents relating to the goods arts 30 and 34 such documents include not only documents that represent the proprietary right to the goods needed to claim or dispose of the goods eg bills of lading warehouse receipts but also for example invoices insurance policies certificates of origin certificates of quality and any other documents that the contract requires to be handed over in the case of a letter of credit the sellers duty in respect of shipping documents is to present them to the bank nominated to receive them parties often specify in the contracts what these documents are for example by incorporating trade terms under the incoterms 219 in the case of documentary sales where the sellers obligation is to deliver documents that represent the proprietary right to the goods needed to claim or dispose of the goods eg bills of lading warehouse receipts articlexa058 provides that the buyer must pay the price when the seller places the documents controlling the disposition of the goods at the buyers disposal artxa058 paraxa01 however in principle only after having had an opportunity to examine the goods is the buyer bound to pay artxa058 paraxa03 the examination under articlexa058 paragraphxa03 is limited to a brief and superficial examination of the goods unlike the examination under articlexa038 on articlexa058 see parasxa0246247 below 220 the documents must conform to the contract they must be handed over at the time and place and in the form required by the contract if the seller has handed over documents before that time the seller may up to that time cure any lack of conformity in the documents as far as the exercise of this right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense however the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in the cisg arts 34 45 paraxa01 b and 7477 iv substantive law of international sales 51 221 the seller must transfer the property ownership in the goods to the buyer artxa030 if the seller is unable to transfer property in the goods because title in the goods is vested in another person the seller is in breach artxa041 222 the cisg is not concerned with how such transfer can and should be effec tuated artxa04 para b that is to be determined according to the law governing transfer of property applicable by virtue of pil rules see paraxa0121 above how is the passing of risk regulated under the cisg 223 the goods identified to the contract may get lost or damaged when that happens whether the nondelivery in case of loss or delivery of damaged goods in case of damage amounts to a breach of the sellers obligation to deliver goods depends on whether the loss or damage occurred before or after the passing of the risk of loss or damage 224 when loss of or damage to the goods occurs after the risk of loss or damage has passed from the seller to the buyer the seller is not obligated to remedy the loss or damage and the buyer must pay the full price artxa066 however there are two exceptions first if the loss or damage is due to an act or omission of the seller not delivering or delivering the damaged goods is a breach of the sellers obligation to deliver the goods artxa066 it is irrelevant whether that act or omission itself amounts to a breach of the sellers obligation second even if loss or damage occurs after the passing of the risk if there was a fundamental breach of contract by the seller whether or not it is the cause of the loss or damage the buyer may resort to the remedies available to the buyer on account of such breach artxa070 this includes requesting delivery of substitute goods artxa0 46 paraxa0 2 and declaring avoidance termination artxa0 49 paraxa0 1 b notwithstanding the fact that the loss or damage occurred after the passing of risk 225 on the other hand if loss of or damage to the goods occurs before the risk passes to the buyer the seller will have to deliver substitute goods otherwise the seller will be in breach of the obligation to deliver the goods 226 it follows from the above that determination of the time when the risk passes is critical the parties are free to agree on the time the risk passes in practice parties often agree on the time of passing of the risk by agreeing on a trade term in accordance with the incoterms however the incoterms rules do not define the consequences of passing of the risk the incoterms rules generally consider that the risk of loss remains with the seller until the seller has delivered the goods in accordance with each term for example under fca cpt and cip the risk passes when the goods have been handed over to or placed at the disposal of the carrier under fob and cif when the seller places the goods on board the vessel and 52 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts under exw dap and ddp when the seller places the goods at the buyers disposal at the agreed point if the parties have not made such an agreement the risk passes under the cisg according to articles 67 and 68 from a practical viewpoint parties should purchase insurance to cover their loss 227 the passing of risk is detached from the question of transfer of property inxa0general the risk passes when the seller has done everything to deliver the goods and when the buyer is in a better position to control the goods it should be noted that the risk does not pass to the buyer unless the goods are identified to the contract arts 67 paraxa02 and 69 paraxa03 228 the upicc do not have express default provisions on the passing of risk of loss and its consequence in view of their broader scope of application to all contracts passing of risk in contracts for the sale of goods involving carriage 229 articlexa067 specifies the time of passing of the risk in cases where the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods if the seller is not bound to hand them over to the carrier at a particular place the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer in accordance with the contract of sale this coincides with the manner of delivery required of the seller under articlexa033 paragraphxa0a if the seller is bound to hand the goods over to a carrier at a particular place the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are handed over to the carrier at that place eg if an inland seller agrees to hand over the goods to a carrier at a seaport the risk does not pass by handing over the goods to the first inland carrier at the sellers place of business the fact that the seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the disposition of the goods eg bills of lading after handing over the goods to the carrier does not affect the passing of the risk in these cases the seller has already delivered the goods and the risk of loss during the entire transport is on the buyer who is in a better position to establish loss or damage after the goods arrive at the destination 230 however the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identi fied to the contract artxa067 paraxa02 identification may be done by markings on the goods by shipping documents by notice given to the buyer or otherwise identifica tion after shipment is particularly relevant to the sale of undivided bulk goods iv substantive law of international sales 53 passing of risk in contracts for the sale of goods in transit 231 articlexa0 68 deals with the situation where the goods already in transit are sold in principle the risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time of the conclusion of the contract however if the circumstances so indicate eg the buyer has insurance coverage for the period of entire transport the risk is assumed retroactively by the buyer from the time the goods are handed over to a carrier that issues the documents embodying the contract of carriage the document can be any document that demonstrates the existence of the contract it need not be a document controlling the disposition of the goods 232 nevertheless if at the time of the conclusion of the contract of sale of goods in transit the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost or damaged and did not disclose this to the buyer the loss or damage is at the risk of the seller artxa068 passing of risk in all other cases 233 articlexa0 69 provides the time of passing of risk for cases not covered by articles 67 and 68 if the buyer is to take over the goods at the sellers place of business the risk passes to the buyer upon taking over the goods artxa069 paraxa01 this is because the buyer is then in a position to control the disposition of the goods however if the buyer does not take over the goods in due time the risk still passes from the time when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer and the buyer commits a breach of contract by failing to take delivery see artsxa053 and 60 the time of placing the goods at the buyers disposal and the time the buyer fails to take delivery may not coincide because the seller may place the goods at the buyers disposal before the due date or the seller was required to notify the buyer that the goods were placed at the buyers disposal placing the goods at the buyers disposal alone is not sufficient to pass the risk because the seller is in control of the goods at the place of business of the seller 234 if the buyer is to take over the goods at a place other than the place of busi ness of the seller eg the buyers place of business or a third partys warehouse the risk passes when delivery is due the goods are placed at the buyers disposal at that place and the buyer is aware of that fact artxa069 paraxa02 it should be noted that this is different from the incoterms rules which generally do not make buyers awareness a requirement for passing of risk the passing of risk under articlexa069 paragraphxa02 takes place earlier than under articlexa069 paragraphxa01 because the seller is not in control of the goods 54 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 235 it should be noted however that the goods are not considered to be placed at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified to the contract artxa069 paraxa03 what are the obligations of the buyer 236 the general obligations of the buyer are to pay the price for the goods and to take delivery of them as required by the contract and the cisg artxa053 obligation to pay the price 237 the buyers obligation to pay the price includes taking such steps and com plying with such formalities as may be required under the contract or any laws and regulations to enable payment to be made artxa054 for example if the contract requires payment by a letter of credit the buyer must arrange with the bank to open a letter of credit the buyer must also comply with currency exchange regula tions in view of the general principle of strict liability under the cisg a buyer who is unable to pay the price because the relevant authority denies permission to transfer funds would still be liable for nonpayment subject to the possibility of exemption under articlexa079 parties concerned about the risk of adverse currency and monetary control measures may consider the upicc which contain a set of specific default rules arts 61146117 on the application for public permission defined in broad terms addressing the issues of which party should apply for the permission and which obligations derive for that party as well as the consequences in terms of liability of a refusal of permission or of a situation where permission is neither granted nor refused 238 the parties may not have expressly or implicitly fixed or made a provision for determining the price even when the contract is validly concluded see paraxa0161 above in such cases the parties are considered in the absence of any indication to the contrary to have impliedly made reference to the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under comparable circumstances in the trade concerned artxa055 this interpretative solu tion corresponds to the default rule on price determination contained in the upicc and dealing with a situation where a contract does not fix or make provi sions for deter mining the price artxa0 517 the upicc additionally regulate a situation where the contract expressly provides that the price is to be determined by one party by a third person or by reference to external factors a further express provision of the upicc deals with the situation where parties have deliberately left contractual terms open at the time of conclusion of the contract in order for them to be deter mined in the future this provision applies to price terms and is particularly important for longterm contracts see artxa02114 comment 4 iv substantive law of international sales 55 239 if the price is fixed according to the weight of the goods in case of doubt it is to be determined by the net weight and not by the gross weight including the weight of packaging artxa056 currency of payment 240 the currency of payment must be the currency of payment agreed in the contract the question of whether the buyer may choose to pay in a currency of the place of payment if it is different from the contractual currency is not settled under the cisg the upicc allow the choice in certain circumstances artxa0619 if the parties have not agreed on the currency of payment it is not settled under the cisg which currency is to be used but the determination must be made according to articlexa07 paragraphxa02 on the other hand the upicc expressly provide that in such cases payment should be made in the currency of the place of payment artxa06110 method of payment 241 unlike the upicc which have provisions on the method of payment artsxa0617 and 618 the cisg does not provide rules on the methods of payment however the provisions of the cisg on the place of payment artxa057 and the time of payment artxa058 assume that payment may be made by cash or by funds transfer unless the parties have agreed on the method of payment or unless there is a practice established between the parties or binding usage related to the method of payment see artxa09 the buyer may pay in either form any other form of pay ment including payment by bills of exchange promissory notes cheques or docu mentary letters of credit require the agreement of the seller either before or after the conclusion of the contract 242 various uniform law instruments provide rules on payment methods regard ing funds transfer the uncitral model law on international credit transfers 199262 provides a global uniform model regional texts such as the european union directive on payment services63 may also be relevant 243 for payment by bills of exchange promissory notes and cheques

if the parties have agreed on the place of payment payment must be made at that place if the parties have not agreed on the place of payment in principle the buyer must make a payment to the seller at the sellers place of business artxa057 paraxa01 a however if the payment is to be made against the handing over of the goods or of documents payment is to be made at the place where the handing over takes place artxa057 paraxa01 b for the place of handing over the goods see parasxa0178189 above cost of payment 245 for the same reason that the seller bears the cost of delivery see paraxa0190 above the cost of payment is to be borne by the buyer unless otherwise agreed this corresponds to articlexa06111 of the upicc however under the cisg the seller must bear any increase in the expenses incidental to payment that is caused by a change in its place of business subsequent to the conclusion of the contract artxa057 paraxa02 time of payment 246 unless otherwise agreed the buyer must pay the price when the seller places either the goods or documents controlling their disposition at the buyers disposal in accordance with the contract and the cisg artxa0 58 paraxa0 1 the seller may make such payment a condition for handing over the goods or documents if the contract involves carriage of the goods the seller may dispatch the goods on terms whereby the goods or documents controlling their disposition are not to be handed over to the buyer except against payment of the price artxa058 paraxa02 thus the general rule is that the goods or documents and payment are to be exchanged simultaneously 65 general assembly resolution 43165 annex iv substantive law of international sales 57 247 it should be noted that the cisg provides that buyers are not bound to pay the price until they have had an opportunity to examine the goods artxa058 paraxa03 however this right to examine the goods prior to payment does not apply if the procedures for delivery or payment agreed upon by the parties are inconsistent with having such an opportunity eg cash against documents this examination is a short and superficial examination mostly for the purpose of detecting delivery of the wrong goods aliud apparent defects or delivery of the wrong quantity it is to be distinguished from the examination of the goods in order to discover any lack of conformity under articlexa038 248 unlike the law in some jurisdictions the buyer must pay the price on the date fixed by or determinable from the contract and the cisg without the need for any request or compliance with any formality on the part of the seller artxa059 this rule is most relevant when performance of payment and delivery of goods or documents are not simultaneous obligation to take delivery 249 the buyer must take delivery of the goods this involves not only physically taking over taking possession of the goods artxa060 paraxa0b but also doing all the acts which could reasonably be expected of the buyer in order to enable the seller to make delivery artxa060 paraxa0a for example if the buyer is to arrange the shipment of the goods the buyer must conclude a contract of carriage and provide the seller with all information necessary such as the name of the vessel to enable the seller to hand over the goods to the carrier does the cisg contain rules on the preservation of goods 250 in the course of events there may be situations where one party is in pos session of the goods because the other party has failed to take possession of them for example the buyer may be delayed in taking over the goods or the seller may have not taken them over from the buyer following rejection eg request for delivery of substitute goods artxa046 paraxa02 see also paraxa0266 below avoidance of the contract arts 49 51 and 73 see also parasxa0264265 below or refusal of early delivery artxa052 paraxa01 the cisg imposes a duty on the party in possession of the goods to preserve the goods by taking steps reasonable in the circumstances to preserve them arts 85 and 86 paraxa01 this is done for the benefit of the other party as the risk of loss rests on that party see eg arts 69 and 70 251 the steps that are reasonable in the circumstances depend on factors such as the nature of the goods the probability of loss or damage and the prospective seriousness of the loss or damage for example storing perishable foods in a refrig erator would likely be a reasonable step to be taken if the cost of preservation is 58 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts disproportionately high in comparison to the value of the goods such steps would be unreasonable in the circumstances the cisg provides detailed rules in connec tion with two examples of steps for the preservation of goods in its articlesxa087 and 88 252 failure to take reasonable steps to preserve the goods will result in liability for damages under articles 45 paragraphxa01 b or 61 paragraphxa01 b if the goods are lost or damaged 253 moreover articlexa086 paragraphxa02 provides that if goods dispatched to the buyer have been placed at the buyers disposal at their destination but the buyer exercises the right to reject them the buyer has a duty to take physical possession of the goods on behalf of the seller and then to preserve them provided that this can be done without payment of the price and without unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense however the duty to take possession does not arise if the seller or a person authorized to take charge of the goods on the sellers behalf is present at the destination deposit in a warehouse 254 the cisg provides two specific examples of reasonable steps to be taken to preserve the goods the first is to deposit the goods in a warehouse of a third person at the expense of the other party artxa087 this relieves the party owing the duty of preservation to store and preserve the goods however this is not allowed when the expense is not reasonable selfhelp sale and emergency sale 255 the second specific example of reasonable steps to be taken to preserve the goods is the socalled selfhelp sale and emergency sale under articlexa088 256 a party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with articlesxa085 or 86 may sell them by any appropriate means if there has been an unreasonable delay by the other party in taking possession of the goods eg buyers delay in taking over the goods or in taking them back eg sellers delay in taking back the goods when the contract was avoided or in paying the price or the cost of preservation artxa088 paraxa01 257 selfhelp sale does not have to be a judicial sale the sale can take place privately on the market the only restriction is that the sale is by appropriate means if the goods are sold by inappropriate means liability in damages will result 258 if the goods are subject to rapid deterioration eg perishables or their preservation would involve unreasonable expense eg feeding of animals a party iv substantive law of international sales 59 who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with articles 85 or 86 must take reasonable measures to sell them artxa0 88 paraxa0 2 unlike selfhelp sale under articlexa088 paragraphxa01 emergency sale is a duty of the party bound to preserve the goods 259 as is the case with selfhelp sale under articlexa088 paragraphxa01 emergency sale can take place privately on the market as long as the measure of selling the goods is reasonable if the measure is not reasonable that will result in liability for damages given the urgency of the matter in emergency sales terms less favourable than those tolerated under articlexa088 paragraphxa01 can be considered reasonable under articlexa088 paragraphxa02 what are the remedies available to the seller and the buyer underxa0the cisg when is a party exempt from liability 260 articles 30 and 53 summarize the obligations of the seller and the buyer respectively under the cisg while the seller must deliver the goods hand over any documents relating to them and transfer the property in the goods the buyer must pay the price for the goods and take delivery of them as required by the contract and the convention 261 the cisg contains additional obligations addressed to the seller eg artxa0 35 on the sellers obligation to deliver conforming goods and the buyer a breach of contract under the cisg exists when any obligation deriving from the cisg or the parties agreement has been infringed 262 given the unitary approach of the cisg to contract breach in principle every breach triggers the same remedies however the remedies provisions in the cisg occasionally refer to particular categories of breaches the cisg contains separate provisions governing the buyers remedies for breach of contract by the seller arts 4552 and the sellers remedies for breach of contract by the buyer arts 6165 in both cases the aggrieved party may claim damages as provided in articles 74 to 77 263 the cisg rules on remedies strongly influenced the provisions of the upicc on remedies chapxa07 the upicc however contain a number of additional provi sions covering issues not expressly settled by the cisg see parasxa0379381 below 60 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts avoidance of the contract 264 the severe remedy of contract avoidance equivalent to termination under the upicc terminology see paraxa0381 below requires in general that a funda mental breach has occurred the cisg as well as the upicc privileges the preservation of the agreement favor contractus and the need to minimize transac tion costs axa0breach is fundamental when it substantially deprives the nonbreaching party of what it is entitled to expect under the contract artxa02566 the definition of a fundamental breach can be made only in the light of the parties contract and the circumstances of each particular case in general the case law establishes a high threshold for the avoidance of the contract on the grounds of fundamental breach parties may define what constitutes a fundamental breach in the contract 265 in addition the sales contract can be avoided when an additional period of time for performance has lapsed a without delivery of the goods by the seller artxa049 paraxa01 b in which case the buyer may declare the contract avoided or b in a situation of nonpayment or failure to take delivery by the buyer artxa064 paraxa01 b in which case the seller may declare the contract avoided other remedies available to the buyer 266 in addition in the case of breach the buyer has the right to require specific performance of the sellers obligations artxa046 paraxa01 under articlexa028 the rem edy of specific performance is subject to its availability under the law applicable to the court or arbitral proceedings where the remedy is sought articlexa0722 of the upicc contains detailed provisions on specific performance that may be helpful in situations envisaged by articlexa0 28 of the cisg delivery of nonconforming goods by the seller triggers the buyers right to claim delivery of substitute goods artxa046 paraxa02 but only when the breach is deemed fundamental the buyer may also require that the seller repair the nonconforming goods artxa046 paraxa03 267 reduction of the contract price artxa050 is also available to the buyer in the case of nondelivery of conforming goods 268 the remedies provided for in articles 46 to 50 are subject to special rules artxa051 in situations of partial delivery 269 the buyer has further rights not explicitly mentioned in articles 46 to 52 if the contract is breached by the seller such rights include remedies in the case of 66 the corresponding provision in the upicc artxa0731 contains a nonexhaustive list of additional elements to be considered when determining whether there is a fundamental nonperformance iv substantive law of international sales 61 anticipatory breach and instalment contracts arts 7173 and the right to withhold performance of the buyers own obligations in particular payment of the agreed price other remedies available to the seller 270 when the contract is breached by the buyer the seller may require the buyer to pay the price take delivery or perform the other obligations unless the seller has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement artxa0 62 these remedies fall under the general category of specific performance 271 the contract may be avoided by the seller if the failure of the buyer to perform any of the obligations under the contract or the cisg amounts to a fundamental breach artxa064 paraxa01 a it may also be avoided if the buyer does not perform the obligation to pay the price or take delivery of the goods within the additional period of time fixed by the seller in accordance with articlexa063 paragraphxa01 272 finally when the buyer fails to specify the form measurement or other features of the goods as provided in the contract the seller may make the specifica tion in accord ance with the requirements of the buyer that may be known to the seller artxa065 how are damages regulated under the cisg 273 in the case of breach of contract the most important cisg remedy in practice is the claim for damages which is common to the buyer artxa045 paraxa01 b and the seller artxa0 61 paraxa0 1 b the calculation of damages and the exemptions that may apply are governed by articles 7477 and 7980 the principle of full compensation applies but it is limited to the losses that were foreseeable for the breaching party at the time of the conclusion of the contract artxa074 in determining the damages there is no need to prove the fault of the breaching party evidence of causality linking the breaching partys conduct to the damages caused which must also be proved will suffice 274 while articlexa074 of the cisg states the general rule for the measurement of damages articles 75 and 76 establish alternative methods to that end articlexa075 regulates the operation of a substitute transaction as a result of a breach of contract the aggrieved seller may resell the goods or the aggrieved buyer may repurchase the goods in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time after avoidance and may recover the difference between the contract price and the price of the substitute transaction under articlexa076 damages are established in line with the current or market price for the goods in question the current price must be estab lished at the time of avoidance artxa076 paraxa01 and correspond to the price prevailing at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made artxa076 paraxa02 62 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 275 articlexa077 of the cisg provides that a party who relies on a breach of contract must take measures to mitigate losses noncompliance with such obligation results in the nonperforming party not being liable for any losses that the aggrieved party could have avoided 276 under the principle of freedom of contract artxa06 the parties may derogate from articles 7477 and provide for the payment of agreed sums for failure to per form the contract the cisg itself contains no specific rules on agreed sums but in the light of the general principles on which it is based artxa07 paraxa02 any rules on the protection of the obligor of the otherwise applicable law or rules of law relying on notions such as reasonableness excessiveness or proportionality must be applied in accordance with an international standard in this respect articlexa0 7413 of the upicc and the uniform rules on contract clauses for an agreed sum due upon failure of performance 198367 are based on such notions parties wishing to make specific provisions on this matter may wish to refer to them are there situations in which the party in breach is exemptedxa0fromxa0damages 277 the breaching party may be exempted from paying damages if the breach of contract was caused by an impediment beyond that partys control artxa0 79 paraxa0168 however the cisg makes no provision for renegotiation or adaptation of a contract to restore its original equilibrium if it was fundamentally altered by an unanticipated supervening event that increases the cost of a partys performance or diminishes the value of the performance a party receives hardship some judicial decisions and doctrinal authorities refer to articlexa0 79 as a gateway to addressing such situations under the cisg articles 621 to 623 of the upicc have detailed provisions that may be used to regulate the consequences of hardship in inter national contracts69 278 according to the principle of freedom of contract artxa06 the parties may derogate from the provisions of the convention by directly excluding or limiting the breaching partys liability in the event of nonperformance or defective perfor mance limitation and exclusion clauses an express provision on exclusion or limitation of liability and its limits is contained in the upicc artxa0716 see also paraxa0378 below 67 official records of the general assembly thirtyeighth session supplement noxa017 a3817 annex i see also below parasxa0400405 additional information on the uniform rules is available on the uncitral website 68 the upicc contain an analogous provision in articlexa0717 which specifies the duties of information of the nonperforming parties and the consequences of a breach of such duties that articlexa0also expressly states that a party is not prevented from exercising a right to terminate the contract or to withhold performance or to request interest on money due 69 on the hardship provisions of the upicc see paragraphxa0378 below iv substantive law of international sales 63 are parties entitled to interest on sums which are not paid 279 a claim for interest artxa078 is available for any breach of contract by the buyer or the seller whether it is fundamental or not this provision sets forth an unambiguous entitlement to interest for the aggrieved party but does not determine the applicable interest rate this was done in acknowledgement of the fact that inter est may violate mandatory provisions of domestic law in some jurisdictions most state courts applying articlexa078 determine the interest rate according to the domestic law applicable by reference to the conflict of laws rules of the forum state though there are arbitral and judicial decisions that have referred to a uniform standard for the drafting of contractual provisions on the applicable interest rate parties may wish to consider the uniform rule provided in articlexa0749 of the upicc70 anticipatory breach and instalment contracts 280 a number of remedies are available to either the buyer or the seller in the case of anticipatory breach by the other party articlexa071 of the cisg authorizes the aggrieved party to suspend the performance of obligations contained in single or instalment contracts if after the conclusion of the contract it has become appar ent that a substantial part of the obligations of the other party will not be performed by that party anticipated nonperformance by the other party must result either from a serious deficiency in the ability to perform or in creditworthiness or from the conduct in preparing to perform or in performing the contract 281 in addition the contract may be avoided if prior to the date of perfor mance it becomes clear that the buyer or the seller will commit a fundamental breach artxa072 282 finally a contract for delivery of goods by instalments may be avoided if the failure of one party to perform any obligations in respect of any instalment constitutes a fundamental breach with respect to that instalment artxa073 paraxa01 the whole contract may be avoided if the breaching party gives the other party good grounds to conclude that a fundamental breach will occur with respect to future instalments final clauses 283 as usual in treaties part iv of the cisg contains its final clauses namely provisions that set forth how states may become a party to the treaty or that allow a state to modify the scope of application of the treaty by lodging declarations in 70 see parasxa0351353 and 393 below for an overview of the case law on the point see uncitral digest of case law on the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods articlexa078 64 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts line with a general obligation on states to periodically review treaty declarations several declarations to the cisg have been withdrawn at the same time it is not unusual for new contracting states to lodge declarations what is the relationship between the cisg and other international agreements dealing with matters governed by the cisg 284 according to articlexa090 the cisg does not prevail over other international agreements dealing with matters governed by the cisg if the parties to the contract have their places of business in states parties to such agreements according to one view international agreements do not include regional uniform law that needs to be transposed into national law such as european union directives 285 in general the cisg and international agreements on pil aspects of inter national sales contracts are mutually compatible see parasxa02730 above 286 articlexa099 requires the denunciation of the convention relating to a uni form law on the formation of contracts for the international sale of goods and of the convention relating to a uniform law on the international sale of goods before adoption of the cisg the relevance of those two conventions is mostly historical71 b limitation convention 1 the purpose of the limitation convention 287 the limitation convention provides uniform international legal rules govern ing the limitation period in a contract for the international sale of goods the limi tation period is defined as a period of time within which a party under a contract for the international sale of goods needs to commence legal proceedings including judicial arbitral and administrative proceedings against the other party to assert a claim arising from the contract or relating to its breach termination or invalidity artxa01 paraxa01 after the expiration of the limitation period no such claim may be recognized or enforced in any legal proceedings 71 all states parties to the convention relating to a uniform law on the formation of contracts for the inter national sale of goods and the convention relating to a uniform law on the international sale of goods except the gambia and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland have denounced those conventions and adopted the cisg iv substantive law of international sales 65 288 similar rules exist in most legal systems however a disparity exists not only regarding the length of the period and the rules governing the limitation of claims after the lapse of the period but also regarding the conceptual basis of limitation periods some jurisdictions consider that claims are extinguished as a matter of substantive law as the result of expiration of the period eg civil law rules on extinctive prescription periods other jurisdictions consider that the limi tation period is a procedural rule barring the bringing of claims to the courts eg common law rules of statute of limitations the limitation convention does not attempt to solve this debate instead it adopts a functional approach by listing the consequences of the expiration of the limitation periods 289 for international commercial contracts other than sale of goods or if the parties have opted out of the limitation convention in a contract for the international sale of goods pertinent rules on limitation periods can be found in chapterxa010 of the upicc the following paragraphs include a brief comparison of the limitation convention and chapterxa010 of the upicc 2 scope of application of the limitation convention 290 the limitation convention applies to the same contract for the inter national sale of goods to which the cisg applies compare articles 1 paragraphxa01 3 4 and 6 of the limitation convention with articles 1 2 and 3 of the cisg72 291 while the cisg does not deal with validity of the contract artxa04 paraxa0a the limitation convention governs the limitation periods of claims resulting from the invalidity of contracts artxa01 paraxa01 they include claims for the restitution of goods delivered or payment made under a contract which subsequently turns out to be invalid because of but not limited to fraud artxa010 paraxa03 292 even when the limitation convention is applicable to a contract it does not govern the limitation period of certain claims arising from that contract artxa0 573 the limitation period of those claims will be governed by the law applicable according to pil rules 72 the limitation convention adopted in 1974 predates the cisg which was adopted in 1980 in order to harmonize the scope of application of the limitation convention with that of the cisg the protocol amending the convention on the limitation period in the international sale of goods was adopted at the same diplomatic confer ence that adopted the cisg although there are minor differences in the language of the provisions the rules are basically identical the present guide makes reference to the limitation convention as amended in 1980 73 those claims are a claims based upon death of or personal injury to any person b claims based upon nuclear damage caused by the goods sold c claims based upon security interest in property d claims based upon judgments or documents upon which enforcements can be obtained and e claims based upon bills of exchange cheque or promissory note artxa05 66 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 293 as is the case under the cisg the parties may opt out of the limitation convention as a whole by agreement artxa03 paraxa02 if the parties have opted out of the limitation convention the law applicable according to pil rules governs the question of limitation period it should be noted that the provisions of the limitation convention are mandatory except for modification of the length of the limitation period under articlexa022 paragraphs 2 and 3 therefore unlike articlexa06 of the cisg there is no provision in the limitation convention allowing the parties to derogate from or vary the effects of its provisions 3 provisions on limitation periods what is the length of the limitation period underxa0thexa0limitationxa0convention 294 the limitation convention adopts a dual limitation period there is a gen eral limitation period of 4 years artxa08 which can be extended or recommenced and a maximum limitation period of 10 years artxa023 which is a fixed period 295 with respect to the time when the limitation period commences to run the basic rule is that it commences on the date on which the claim accrues artxa0 9 paraxa0 1 namely the date the claim matures74 this applies to both the general limitation period and the maximum limitation period 296 the adoption of an objective time of commencement for both periods in the limitation convention is an approach different from the one adopted in recent domestic legislation and the upicc the latter texts also adopt a dual limitation period approach but tend to choose a subjective time of commencement eg the day the obligee knows or ought to know certain facts for the shorter general period and an objective time of commencement eg the date the right can be exercised for the longer maximum period eg artxa0102 of the upicc the approach of the limitation convention is due to the peculiarities of longdistance trade and also to the fact that there is little need to protect a nonconsumer seller or buyer by delaying commencement of the limitation period by adopting a subjective time of commence ment for the shorter period 297 the upicc adopt a shorter general limitation period of three years beginning on the day after the day the obligee knows or ought to know the facts as a result of which the obligees right can be exercised artxa0102 paraxa01 the length of the maximum limitation period under the upicc is 10 years which is the same as 74 the convention also provides special rules on the commencement of the period depending on the type of claim arts 1012 iv substantive law of international sales 67 under the limitation convention however the day of commencement is slightly different it is the day after the day the right can be exercised artxa0102 paraxa02 298 the limitation convention has a detailed rule on how the limitation period is to be calculated artxa028 can the length be modified by agreement of the parties 299 the general limitation period cannot be modified by agreement of the parties prior to its running but it can be extended by a written declaration of the debtor during the running of the period artxa022 parasxa01 and 2 in addition the contract of sale may stipulate a shorter period for the commencement of arbitral proceedings if the stipulation is valid under the law applicable to the contract artxa022 paraxa03 the maximum limitation period cannot be modified by agreement of the parties 300 the upicc are more lenient in terms of modification of the limitation period the general limitation period can be shortened by the agreement of the parties but not to less than one year the upicc also allow the maximum period to be modified by agreement of the parties except that it cannot be shortened to less than 4 years or extended to more than 15 years artxa0103 what happens if the limitation period expires 301 the principal consequence of the expiration of the limitation period is that no claim will be recognized or enforced in legal proceedings commenced thereafter artxa025 paraxa01 the limitation convention is only concerned with the recogni tion or enforcement of claims in any legal proceedings and is not concerned with whether the right is extinguished or not the upicc on the other hand expressly provide that the expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the right artxa0109 paraxa01 302 however according to the limitation convention even after the limitation period has expired a party can in certain situations raise a claim as a defence to or set off against a claim asserted by the other party artxa0 25 paraxa0 2 see also artxa0109 paraxa03 of the upicc will the court consider the limitation period on its own initiative 303 articlexa024 of the limitation convention provides that the expiration of the limitation period will not be taken into consideration in legal proceedings unless it is invoked by a party to the proceedings see also artxa0109 paraxa02 of the upicc 68 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts how can the creditor stop the running of the limitation period 304 limitation periods cease to run when the claimant commences judicial or arbitral proceedings against the debtor or when a claim is asserted by the claimant in existing court proceedings arts 13 and 14 of the limitation convention see also arts 105 and 107 of the upicc75 procedures for commencement of judicial proceedings depend on national laws and therefore the limitation convention indicates that any act which under the law of the court where the proceedings are instituted is recognized as commencing judicial proceedings constitutes the com mencement of judicial proceedings arbitral proceedings are commenced accord ing to the manner provided for in the arbitration agreement or by the applicable arbi tration law for example with the receipt of the request for arbitration and of any other required information by the secretariat of an arbitral institution in the absence of such a provision arbitration proceedings are deemed to commence on the date that the request for arbitration is delivered to the respondent see also artxa03 paraxa02 of the uncitral arbitration rules 305 by cessation limitation periods are not suspended see however paraxa0308 below nor do they recommence anew see however parasxa0310 and 311 below they simply cease to run in other words they do not run anymore 306 the upicc adopt a different approach by providing that the running of the limitation period is suspended when the obligee asserts rights in judicial pro ceedings or arbitration proceedings such as by commencing the proceedings or in insolvency proceedings or dissolution proceedings arts 105 paraxa01 and 106 paraxa0 1 the suspension lasts until a final decision has been issued or until the proceedings have been otherwise terminated arts 105 paraxa02 and 106 paraxa02 the upicc also extend these rules to proceedings of alternative dispute resolution such as mediation whereby the parties request a third person to assist them in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute artxa0107 what happens if proceedings do not result in a decision on the merits of the claim 307 judicial or arbitral proceedings commenced by a claimant within the limita tion period might terminate without a binding decision on the merits of the claim for example because the court or arbitral tribunal lacks jurisdiction or because of 75 the limitation convention provides a special rule that prevents limitation periods for counterclaims from expiring artxa016 it also contains a special rule to resolve questions concerning the running of limitation periods when there are jointly and severally liable debtors and when the buyer brings a recourse claim against the seller if a proceeding has been commenced against the buyer by a party that purchased the goods from the buyer artxa018 iv substantive law of international sales 69 a procedural defect for such case the limitation convention provides that if the original proceedings end without a binding decision on the merits the limitation period will be deemed to have continued to run artxa017 paraxa01 308 in that situation most legal systems allow the creditor to pursue the claim by commencing new proceedings however by the time the original proceedings have ended the limitation period might have expired or there might remain insuffi cient time for the claimant to commence new proceedings to protect the claimant in those cases the convention grants an additional period of one year to commence new proceedings artxa017 paraxa02 however this is subject to the maximum limitation period of 10 years artxa023 309 the upicc adopt a different approach by providing that suspension of the limitation period lasts not only until a binding decision has been issued but also until the proceedings have been terminated without reaching a final decision artsxa0105 paraxa02 and 106 paraxa02 therefore there is no provision under the upicc that corresponds to articlexa017 paragraphxa02 of the limitation convention does the obligors performance or acknowledgement have any effect on the running of the limitation period 310 under the limitation convention the limitation period recommences ie the fouryear period runs anew within the total limit of 10 years from the date the claim accrued in two situations in the first situation the limitation period recommences if the creditor performs in the debtors state an act including an act that can be made outside legal proceedings that under the law of that state has the effect of recommencing a limitation period artxa019 311 in the second situation the limitation period recommences if the debtor acknowledges the obligation to the creditor in writing artxa0 20 paraxa0 1 or pays interest or partially performs the obligation from which such acknowledgement can be inferred artxa020 paraxa02 the rule is similar but different under the upicc under the upicc there is no requirement for written acknowledgement see artxa0104 paraxa01 another difference is that unlike under the limitation conven tion the maximum period does not recommence but may be exceeded by the beginning of a new general limitation period artxa0104 paraxa02 what happens if the creditor is prevented from instituting legalxa0proceedings 312 the limitation convention protects a creditor who was prevented from taking the necessary acts to stop the running of the limitation period in extreme cases such as commercial dispute resolution in countries that have been affected 70 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts by military conflict it provides that when the creditor could not take those acts as a result of a circumstance beyond the control of the creditor and which could be neither avoided nor overcome the limitation period will be extended so as to expire one year after the date when the circumstance ceased to exist artxa0 21 however this extension is subject to the maximum limitation period of 10 years artxa023 the upicc adopt the same rule artxa0108 paraxa01 but extend it to a situation where the impediment consists of the incapacity or death of the obligor or the obligee and where a representative of the partys estate has not been appointed or a successor has not inherited the respective partys position artxa0108 paraxa02 how can the creditor make sure that cessation in one state has international effect 313 as noted above the limitation period ceases to run when legal proceedings are instituted arts 1318 of the limitation convention the limitation conven tion provides that such an act in one contracting state also has effect in other contracting states provided that the creditor has taken reasonable steps to inform the debtor artxa030 thus the creditor does not have to worry about instituting court proceedings in all relevant states to cease the running of the limitation period this rule also applies to the extension of limitation periods under articlexa017 and the recommencement of the limitation period under articlexa019 314 under the convention cessation by performance or acknowledgement by the debtor arts 19 and 20 and extension by prevention artxa0 21 are acts or circumstances not connected to a particular state and have international effect by their nature 4 interaction with other uniform law instruments relationship with the cisg general relationship 315 the limitation convention and the cisg may be considered sister conven tions although the cisg governs the rights and obligations of the seller and buyer arising from contracts for the international sale of goods it does not contain rules on limitation periods the limitation convention fills that lacuna although they can be applied independently from each other the most value will be derived if both are applied to a contract thus it is recommended that states become parties to both conventions iv substantive law of international sales 71 316 in 1980 the scope of application of the limitation convention was amended to align it with that of the cisg see para 290 above thus except for a few situations the cisg and the limitation convention apply to the same con tract and claims arising therefrom relationship with time limits under the cisg 317 the cisg contains several provisions that relate to time limits for example articlexa039 paragraphxa02 provides that the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods unless notice is given to the seller of the nonconformity within two years from the date the goods are handed over to the buyer see paraxa0207 above such time limits are not to be confused with the limitation period under the limitation convention the limitation convention expressly provides that it does not affect a particular time limit within which one party is required as a condition for the acquisition or exercise of the claim to give notice to the other party or perform any act other than the institution of legal proceedings artxa01 paraxa02 see also artxa0101 paraxa02 of the upicc relationship with the upicc 318 the parties need to opt out of the limitation convention see paraxa0 293 above in order to choose the upicc as the law applicable to limitation periods provided that pil rules allow such choice relationship with the electronic communications convention 319 the limitation convention contains the requirements for acknowledge ment in writing by the debtor without expressly providing that the written declara tion can be made electronically in this regard the electronic communications convention provides conditions under which such requirements can be met by electronic communications in connection with a contract to which the limitation convention applies arts 9 paraxa02 and 20 paraxa01 relationship with pil 320 the limitation convention does not exclude the application of pil there will always be a law made applicable by the pil rules but for the matter of limita tion periods the limitation convention prevails this is the case even if the law of the forum considers limitation periods as a procedural matter 321 if the parties opt out of the limitation convention in accordance with its articlexa03 paragraphxa02 the otherwise applicable law will apply this includes domestic laws as well as the upicc as far as the pil rules allow such choice by the parties 72 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts c unidroit principles of international commercialxa0 contracts 1 what are the purposes of the upicc 322 the upicc are a nonbinding codification of contract law rules and prin ciples designed for international trade on a global scale their objective is to make available a set of rules that is better suited to crossborder transactions than national contract laws three features of the upicc serve this purpose 323 first the upicc provide a neutral law for international transactions in other words a set of rules that is not the national contract law of either of the parties they achieve this by setting forth rules that do not specifically resemble any particular national contract law and that reflect a compromise between the common law and the civil law traditions 324 second the upicc stipulate rules that are better suited to the special require ments of international trade than national contract law regimes which are primarily designed to deal with national transactions 325 third the upicc are multilingual they are available in a variety of world languages so that it is very likely that both parties to an international contract can access them in a language that they are familiar with 2 how were the upicc developed 326 the upicc were developed by international working groups that consisted of eminent contract lawyers acting in their personal capacity under the auspices of unidroit the publication of the upicc was first authorized by the governing council of unidroit in 1994 327 the drafting of the upicc was preceded by detailed comparative examina tions of existing contract law the working groups drew upon a variety of national contract laws and international contract law instruments as sources of inspiration 328 the working groups consulted a range of national contract laws from the civillaw and commonlaw traditions in particular the main european civil codes english common law and american contract law as set out in the restatement second of contracts and the united states uniform commercial code iv substantive law of international sales 73 329 a number of international conventions were particularly influential in the work of the working groups these included in addition to the cisg and the limi tation convention the convention on agency in the international sale of goods76 the convention on international factoring 198877 and the unitedxa0nations con vention on the assignment of receivables in international trade 200178 the drafters also took into account softlaw instruments issued by other international institutions such as the incoterms see parasxa0143147 above and the ucp see paraxa0243 above moreover they drew inspiration from model contracts of organi zations such as the icc and the international federation of consulting engineers fidic 330 as a result of this comparative exercise the upicc contain two types of provisions some of the articles represent what is often referred to as an international restatement of general principles of contract law in these instances the drafters were able to identify a solution to a particular problem that was shared across domestic and international contract laws and they restated the rule in one of the articles of the instrument however that was frequently not possible because no global common core of solutions could be established in that case the drafters either chose from existing approaches or designed new rules in order to adopt what they perceived to be the best solutions particularly with a view to the special require ments of international trade they aimed to strike a balance between the common law and the civillaw traditions for those reasons the upicc are widely regarded as providing jurisdictionally neutral solutions 3 editions and language versions 331 the upicc are currently in their fourth edition 2016 with the second and third editions dating from 2004 and 2010 respectively new provisions on further issues of contract law were added to each edition and thus the coverage of the upicc was broadened the instrument is available in all five of the official languages of unidroit english french german italian and spanish in addition to those official versions there are numerous translations into other languages all editions and language versions are easily accessible online79 76 more information on this convention is available on the unidroit website 77 united nations treaty series volxa02323 noxa041631 78 general assembly resolution 5681 annex 79 see the unidroit website 74 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 4 what is the meaning of principles of contract law 332 despite the reference to principles in their title the upicc are not con fined to spelling out broad and general standards or principes directeurs such as good faith and fair dealing the majority of the 211 articles are straightforward hardandfast rules which can be applied in the same way as any other national or transnational rule of contract law they more or less predetermine the solution in a given case in a predictable fashion in this regard the upicc very much resem ble a codification of general contract law as can be found in national civil codes or contract law acts or in transnational commercial law instruments such as the cisg 5 what are the basic differences as compared to the cisg and what is their nature 333 the upicc differ from the cisg in three major ways first their status is not that of a treaty they are a nonbinding set of rules that will only apply to a given contract if the parties or an adjudicator so chooses and if such a choice is recognized or acknowledged by the relevant legal framework see parasxa0 4066 above and parasxa0337350 below second the scope of application of the upicc is not confined to contracts of sale the upicc spell out general rules of contract law that may be used for all types of contracts including service contracts see parasxa0354357 below third they contain a vast array of rules pertaining to the general law of contract and obligations and thus on issues not covered by the cisg see below in particular paraxa0396 334 similarly to the cisg and the limitation convention the upicc were designed and drafted under the auspices of an international organization however unlike those and other conventions in the area of transnational commercial law they are a socalled softlaw instrument therefore they do not impose an obligation on states to bring the rules of the instrument into force by way of national legislation constitutional arrangements or other mechanisms of transposition 335 national legislators may enact the upicc either in their entirety or selec tively as domestic rules of contract law as they may do with other uniform law instruments in fact one of the purposes of the upicc as expressly listed in the preamble thereto is to serve as a model for national and international legislators there are many examples of national legislators which have chosen to do so80 80 among others the 1999 contract law of china many postsocialist civil codes in eastern and central eastern europe the 2015 civil and commercial code of argentina and the 2016 revised civil code of france contain many provisions modelled on the upicc the scottish law commission routinely refers to the upicc as a source of inspiration for its legislative proposals in the area of contract law an even more comprehensive introduction has been discussed in australia and spain and also by the organization for the harmonization of business law in africa ohada an intergovernmental organization with 17 states members iv substantive law of international sales 75 336 as long as they have not been implemented in this way the upicc as such do not impose direct obligations on contracting parties they do not automatically apply once a contract is within their scope of application see parasxa0354357 below as would be the case with a binding instrument such as the cisg or the limita tion convention the upicc can only bind the parties if two additional require ments have been met first the parties or someone adjudicating a dispute between them must have chosen to make the upicc applicable in their contractual relation ship see parasxa0337342 below and second such a choice must be respected by the law governing the proceedings between the parties be it the lex fori or the lex arbitri see parasxa0343350 below however even if these requirements have not been met the upicc may indirectly apply to the contractual relationship between the parties if the adjudicator uses them to interpret or supplement the applicable contract law see parasxa0351353 below 6 how can the upicc be used in practice 337 there are various ways in which the upicc can be made to apply in a given contractual relationship 338 first the parties themselves may designate the upicc as the law governing their contract such a choice can be made by express agreement of the parties either at the time of making the contract or at a later stage see chapxa0iii sectxa0b above since the coverage of the upicc is limited to general issues of contract law the parties may wish to supplement the choice with their choice of a domestic law the rules of that law will then serve as a default law for issues outside the scope of application of the upicc in the absence of such choice pil rules will determine the domestic law applicable to those issues 339 in order to assist parties in drafting pertinent choice of law clauses unidroit published the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts in 2013 see parasxa06566 above further model clauses of a similar nature are contained in model contracts of other inter national organizations such as the 2000 icc model international franchising contract the 2002 icc model commercial agency contract and the model contracts for small firms prepared by the international trade centre81 340 second even if the parties choose to have their contract governed by a law other than the upicc or do not designate any governing law at all they may still incorporate the upicc as terms of the contract as they may do with any other set of rules see paraxa025 above they may incorporate the upicc in their entirety 81 the model contracts for small firms are available on the international trade centre website 76 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts or they may incorporate individual provisions or selected parts only for example chapterxa04 setting forth the rules on contractual interpretation or chapterxa06 sectionxa02 containing provisions on hardship 341 insofar as a given rule of the upicc has been incorporated as a term of the contract the contractual relationship between the parties will be governed by that rule however as a term of the contract the rule can bind the parties only to the extent that it does not violate the mandatory provisions of the law governing the contract in other words those rules from which the parties to a contract may not derogate by way of agreement comparative studies have shown that such con flicts arise rarely and even if they do articlexa014 of the upicc expressly acknowl edges the prevalence of mandatory rules see paraxa0102 above 342 third a court or an arbitral tribunal may designate the upicc as the law governing a particular contract there are two scenarios in which adjudicators may find this attractive a the parties have not chosen any law at all to govern their contract and b the parties have agreed that their contract should be governed by some unwritten transnational body of rules such as the general principles of law the lex mercatoria or usages and customs of international trade in the former scenario the upicc will normally offer a more neutral solution than the domestic contract law of a given state they also tend to be better adapted to the needs of international trade than national contract law rules that are not particularly concerned with the specific problems arising in crossborder contracting in the latter scenario the upicc are generally considered the best available and most accessible manifestation of the unwritten rules of international commerce 7 how would judges and arbitrators apply a clause designating the upicc as the applicable law of the contract 343 a choice by the parties to designate the upicc as the law governing their contract will not always be acknowledged by the relevant legal framework nor will it always be possible for adjudicators to make such choices the reason for this is that party autonomy with regard to the choice of nonstate law has traditionally been limited and continues to be so in important aspects see parasxa04447 above judicial setting 344 the possibility of choosing nonstate law is particularly limited in litigation before state courts some courts may not acknowledge a choice of the upicc as the law governing the contract made by the parties and they are not themselves free to designate the upicc as the applicable law this is because they are subject iv substantive law of international sales 77 to the pil rules of their forum most of these rules limit party autonomy to the choice of a particular state law and thus exclude choices of transnational nonstate law instru ments such as the upicc a major regional instrument following this traditional approach is the rome i regulation artxa03 paraxa01 see also parasxa05556 above 345 the domestic pil rules of paraguay and uruguay are a notable exception to the traditional approach see paraxa047 above if legislators in other states were to follow this example the courts of those states would also have to acknowledge the choice of the upicc by the parties 346 it has also been argued that under articlexa0 9 paragraphxa0 2 of the mexico convention state courts should take the upicc into account as general princi ples of international commercial law if the parties have not chosen a law applicable to the contract82 however the mexico convention has not yet secured a large number of accessions and ratifications 347 even when a traditional choice of law regime applies a state court does not have to entirely ignore the fact that the parties intended to choose the upicc in order to give effect as much as possible to the intention of the parties such a court should interpret the intention to choose the law governing the contract as an agreement to incorporate the upicc as terms of the contract see parasxa0340 342 above in the european union for example this possibility is specifically mentioned in recital 13 of the rome i regulation arbitral setting 348 as opposed to state courts arbitral tribunals normally acknowledge the parties choice of nonstate law such as the upicc the reason for this is that the rules of arbitration of most arbitral institutions provide that the parties are free to agree upon the rules of law to be applied by the tribunal eg icc rules artxa021 paraxa01 this notion includes nonstate law such as the upicc in ad hoc arbitrations subject to the uncitral arbitration rules the tribunal is also bound to accept a choice of rules of law artxa035 paraxa01 moreover most domestic laws on arbitration respect the freedom of the parties to choose nonstate law in arbitral proceedings this is particularly so in those states that have adopted articlexa028 paragraphxa01 of the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration 349 parties wishing to have their contract governed by the upicc are therefore well advised to combine a choice of law clause in favour of the upicc see parasxa06566 above with an arbitration agreement at least one arbitral institution 82 see for example the guide on the law applicable to international commercial contracts in the americas parasxa0185187 and 352354 78 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts explicitly suggests the choice of the upicc to parties that agree to have their dispute arbitrated by the institution83 350 finally under the arbitration regimes mentioned in paragraphxa0348 above arbitral tribunals are often free to apply the upicc if the parties have expressly authorized the tribunal to decide ex aequo et bono or as amiable compositeur eg uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration artxa028 paraxa03 and icc rules artxa021 paraxa03 or have not made any stipulation with regard to the law governing the merits of the dispute eg icc rules artxa021 paraxa01 in those cases many of the relevant arbitration rules and laws tend to afford the tri bunal broad discretion to apply the rules of law which it determines to be appro priate eg french code of civil procedure artxa01511 paraxa01 under articlexa056 of the 2013 panama arbitration law tribunals in international arbitration are even under a duty to take the upicc among other sources of law into account 8 indirect application as a means of interpretation and supplementation 351 even in scenarios in which neither the parties nor the adjudicator have des ignated the upicc as the law governing the contract or in which such a designa tion took place but is not acknowledged by the relevant legal framework the upicc may affect the contractual relationship of the parties this happens when state courts or arbitral tribunals use the upicc as a means of interpreting and supplementing the otherwise applicable contract law 352 adjudicators may use the upicc to determine the meaning of rules and concepts of national contract laws and international uniform law instruments in cluding the cisg whether an adjudicator may take the upicc into account for the purposes of interpretation of another contract law regime depends on the rules and principles of interpretation of that particular regime recourse to the upicc in interpreting the cisg for example is generally accepted because articlexa07 para graphxa01 of the cisg stipulates that in its interpretation regard is to be had to its international character 353 adjudicators may also have recourse to the upicc to fill gaps in national and international contract law regimes in both the national and the international con texts the permissibility of gapfilling with reference to the upicc depends on the relevant rules and principles on the methodology and the limits of gapfilling in the cisg for example the relevant rule is articlexa07 paragraphxa02 see parasxa0127132 above 83 articlexa035 paragraphxa01 c of the arbitration rules of the chineseeuropean arbitration centre iv substantive law of international sales 79 it stipulates that questions concerning matters governed by the convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general prin ciples on which it is based the general principles to which articlexa07 paragraphxa02 refers are overarching rules that permeate the entire convention or at least a signifi cant number of its provisions they are arguably not numerous and the more detailed upicc do represent a compilation of such general principles nevertheless both the cisg and the upicc draw largely on the same sources and at least some of the rules contained in the upicc are restatements of general principles of international commercial law on which among others the cisg is based uncitral has for mally commended the use of the upicc for their intended purposes84 and these purposes as set out in the preamble to the upicc include the use of the upicc to supplement international uniform law instruments 9 what is the scope of application of the upicc 354 according to the first paragraphxa0 of their preamble the upicc set forth general rules for international commercial contracts 355 the scope of the instrument is not narrowly confined the notions of both international and commercial contracts are to be understood broadly they poten tially include all crossborder transactions in which neither of the parties acts as a consumer in this regard their scope of application resembles that of the cisg and the limitation convention see parasxa0106109 and 290293 above 356 as opposed to those conventions however the scope of application of the upicc is not confined to contracts for the sale of goods the upicc set forth general rules of contract law as such they are not specifically concerned with the rules pertaining to any particular type of contract rather they contain provi sions on general matters of contract law that occur in all types of contract such as formation interpretation validity and the remedies for nonperformance as a result the upicc apply to all types of international commercial contracts includ ing but not limited to the sale of goods most importantly service contracts are also within their scope of application 357 issues may arise with regard to the intertemporal scope of application of the various editions of the upicc there are four different editions of the instru ment dating from 1994 2004 2010 and 2016 with each of them increasing the coverage of the instrument see paraxa0331 above unless the parties have agreed otherwise adjudicators will normally apply the most recent version 84 official records of the general assembly sixtyseventh session supplement noxa017 a6717 parasxa0137140 80 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 10 substantive provisions general overview 358 the coverage of the upicc extends to all important issues of general con tract law that may arise in international commercial contracts the relevant rules and principles are set forth in 211 separate articles the socalled blackletter rules 359 each blackletter rule is followed by an additional comment often includ ing one or more hypothetical case applications illustrations according to unidroit these comments are an integral part of the upicc to the extent that the blackletter rules and the comments taken together constitute the integral version of the instrument85 this is particularly important because some of the comments go beyond mere explanation of the articles in effect they propose additional rules or advocate a narrower reading of certain rules than the text of the relevant articles would seem to indicate 360 the first edition of the upicc published in 1994 set forth 120 articles each of the topics covered was the subject of a separate chapterxa0of the instrument these ranged from formation chapxa02 to validity especially problems arising from defects of consent chapxa03 interpretation chapxa04 content of contracts chapxa05 performance of contracts chapxa06 and remedies for nonperformance chapxa07 chapterxa0 1 sets forth definitions and general principles that apply across all the issues covered it is on those topics particularly with regard to formation and remedies for nonperformance that there is a substantial thematic overlap with the cisg see paraxa0394 below 361 in the 2004 edition 65 new articles were added dealing with six further thematic areas agency chapxa02 sectxa02 contracts for the benefit of third parties chapxa05 sectxa02 setoff chapxa08 assignment of rights transfer of obligations and assignment of contracts chapxa0 9 and limitation periods chapxa0 10 the latter broadly covers the same ground as the limitation convention see paraxa0395 below and chapxa0iv sectxa0b above 362 the 2010 edition contained 26 new provisions on illegality chapxa03 sectxa03 conditions chapxa05 sectxa03 the plurality of obligors and obligees chapxa011 and restitution with respect to contracts to be performed over a period of time artxa0737 as well as a few other changes that were necessitated by those additions 363 with each new edition the portions of the text carried over from the more recent edition remained largely unchanged with revisions confined mainly to some minor amendments and additions and most of these being restricted to the comments 85 the integral versions in english and french are available on the unidroit website iv substantive law of international sales 81 364 a different approach was taken with the 2016 edition the main objective was to better address the special requirements of longterm contracts in order to do so no new provisions were added instead six existing articles and many of the existing comments were substantially amended 365 at present therefore the upicc set forth 211 articles that are divided the matically into 11 chapters with some of these being divided into sections 366 the articles are preceded by a preamble listing the purposes of the instru ment these include the application of the upicc as the law governing the con tract because of a corresponding choice or decision by an adjudicator and their use as a means of interpreting and supplementing national law and international uniform law instruments as such as has been seen the extent to which these purposes will materialize will depend on the relevant lex fori or lex arbitri and on the applicable rules and principles on interpretation and gapfilling 367 chapterxa01 contains a number of general provisions that are meant to inform the interpretation and application of the entire instrument apart from a general rule on the approach to be followed in the interpretation and supplementation of the upicc artxa016 these include a handful of overarching general principles of contract law namely freedom of contract artxa0 11 freedom of form artxa0 12 binding nature of the contract artxa013 and good faith and fair dealing artxa017 the chapterxa0also includes statutory definitions of key terms arts 110 and 111 and a specific articlexa0on the priority of applicable mandatory rules artxa014 see parasxa0102103 above and paraxa0389 below 368 chapterxa02 section 1 deals with the formation of contracts with detailed rules on offer and acceptance that cover among others the withdrawal revocation and rejection of offers arts 2135 cases of modified acceptance artxa02111 and contracts with open terms artxa0 2114 four provisions are devoted to the incorporation of standard terms arts 211922 there are also rules covering bad faith and breaches of confidentiality during the negotiations that lead up to the conclusion of the contract arts 211516 while the rules on offer and accept ance were modelled on and are broadly in line with the cisg the others contain significant further details and cover additional topics see chapxa0iv sectxa0a above 369 chapterxa02 section 2 sets forth rules on agency in the context of contract formation for further information on agency see chapxa0v sectxa0c below it deals with the circumstances in which an agent affects the contractual relations between the principal and the third party the section also provides remedies for the third party against the agent if the latter purports to bind the principal and fails to do so the section therefore governs the express implied and apparent granting of authority to the agent arts 222 and 225 and a potential subagent artxa0228 82 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts as well as the termination of authority artxa0 2210 an agent acting without authority may be liable for damages artxa0 226 unless the principal ratifies the unauthorized act artxa0229 the principal may avoid the contract if the agent was involved in a conflict of interests artxa0227 the section is limited to the external aspects of agency namely the relations between the principal or the agent on the one hand and the third party on the other it does not cover questions arising from the internal relationship between the principal and the agent artxa0221 370 chapterxa03 covers the validity of contracts with a few introductory provisions in chapterxa03 section 1 these clarify that the chapterxa0does not cover questions of capacity artxa0311 and that its rules are mandatory artxa0314 see paraxa0389 below 371 chapterxa03 section 2 lists the relevant grounds for the avoidance of a con tract these are mistake arts 3214 fraud artxa0 325 threat artxa0 326 and gross disparity artxa0327 in all these cases the innocent party has the right to bring the contract to an end with retroactive effect and may claim damages and restitution where appropriate arts 321017 372 chapterxa03 section 3 deals with illegal contracts namely contracts infringing a mandatory rule whether of national international or supranational origin the effects of the infringement are those expressly prescribed by the relevant mandatory rule or in the absence of an express prescription the remedies that are reasonable in the cir cumstances of the case artxa0331 if appropriate restitution may be granted artxa0332 373 chapterxa04 sets out a detailed set of rules for the interpretation of contracts and contractual statements a contract has to be interpreted according to the mean ing that reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties would give to it unless a different common intention of the parties can be established artxa041 in doing so the adjudicator must have regard to all relevant circumstances including the negotiations preceding the contract and the subsequent conduct of the parties artxa043 contracts must be interpreted as a whole artxa044 in a way that all terms are given effect artxa045 and in the event of an unclear term against the party that supplied the term artxa0 46 there are specific rules on linguistic discrepancies between different language versions of a contract artxa047 and gapfilling artxa048 374 chapterxa05 section 1 contains a number of rules pertaining to the content of contracts once concluded the obligations of the parties may be implied artxa0512 and they include a general duty of cooperation artxa0513 criteria for the distinction between duties to achieve a result and duties of best efforts are introduced arts 5145 there are rules on the quality and the price of perfor mance and the possibility of terminating contracts concluded for an indefinite period of time for cases where those issues have not been expressly agreed by the parties arts 5168 iv substantive law of international sales 83 375 chapterxa05 section 2 lays out a comprehensive regime for contracts in favour of third parties namely the conferral of an enforceable contractual right on a bene ficiary by way of agreement between the original parties the promisee and the promisor artxa0521 rules fleshing out the intricate tripartite relationship arising from such contracts include those on potential defences of the promisor the entitle ment of the original parties to revoke the conferral of the right and the right of the beneficiary to renounce the right conferred arts 5246 376 chapterxa05 section 3 deals with contractual conditions it distinguishes suspen sive and resolutive conditions and their respective effects arts 5312 and 535 parties may not interfere with conditions in bad faith and are under a good faith duty to preserve the other partys rights while a condition is pending arts 5334 377 chapterxa06 section 1 contains default rules on how performance is to be ren dered with regard to the time and place of performance arts 611 and 616 the right to reject partial or earlier performance arts 613 and 615 payment modalities arts 61712 and the effects of public permission requirements arts 611417 378 chapterxa06 section 2 deals with the effects of hardship namely supervening events that fundamentally alter the equilibrium of the contract artxa0622 it is clear from articlexa0621 that where the performance of a contract becomes more onerous for one of the parties that party is nevertheless bound to perform its obligations unless the exceptional circumstance of hardship may be invoked as a result of a hardship situation the aggrieved party has a right to renegotiate the contract condi tions so as to restore its equilibrium if the renegotiations are unsuccessful the court or tribunal should it decide to take action may terminate the contract or adapt it with a view to restoring its equilibrium artxa0623 379 chapterxa0 7 sets forth the remedies for nonperformance once again with substantial overlap with the rules in the cisg see paraxa0 394 below to begin with there are a number of general provisions on nonperformance in chapterxa07 section 1 these include the nonperforming partys right to cure artxa0714 the aggrieved partys right to withhold performance artxa0713 the possibility for the aggrieved party to set an additional time for performance at the end of which if the other party has not yet performed the aggrieved party may exercise all available remedies artxa0715 the nachfrist mechanism the policing of exemption clauses artxa0716 and the exemption from liability for damages in cases of force majeure artxa0717 380 chapterxa07 section 2 deals with specific performance that is generally available albeit with a number of important restrictions in the case of nonmonetary obliga tions artxa0722 court orders for performance are strengthened by the possibility of imposing additional judicial penalties artxa0724 84 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 381 chapterxa07 section 3 lays out the rules on termination of contracts this is only available if nonperformance can be qualified as fundamental artxa0731 when an additional period for performance of reasonable length was set and the other party has not performed within that period artxa0 731 paraxa0 3 or when fundamental nonperformance is anticipated before the date set for performance artxa0733 termination does not require the involvement of an adjudicator and can be effected by simple notice artxa0 732 it releases both parties from their obligations artxa0735 and requires a party that has already received performance to return all or some of what it has received arts 7367 382 chapterxa08 allows the parties to set off their obligations against each other if the obligations are of the same kind and certain other requirements are met artxa081 the right of setoff is exercised by notice to the other party arts 834 and setoff once effected discharges the obligations for the future artxa085 383 chapterxa09 contains a detailed regime on the assignment of rights chapxa09 sectxa01 the transfer of obligations chapxa09 sectxa02 and the assignment of contracts chapxa09 sectxa03 384 chapterxa010 on limitation periods conceptualizes limitation as a defence that does not extinguish the right but bars its exercise if asserted arts 101 and 109 it establishes a general period of three years and a maximum period of 10xa0years artxa0102 the parties may modify the period within limits artxa0103 the limitation period may be suspended by judicial or other proceedings and in the case of force majeure or other unforeseen circumstances arts 1058 there are many overlaps with and some differences from the limitation convention see chapxa0iv sectxa0b above 385 chapterxa011 deals with legal issues arising from a plurality of obligors ie axa0scenario where the performance of a contractual obligation is owed by more than one obligor chapxa011 sectxa01 or a plurality of obligees ie a scenario where the performance of a contractual obligation is owed to more than one obligee chapxa011 sectxa02 11 selected features 386 many of the rules of the upicc are specifically designed for the particular requirements of international trade these include provisions on the relevant time zone artxa0112 linguistic discrepancies between versions of the contract artxa047 public permission requirements arts 611417 currency of payment arts 61910 and the currency in which damages are to be assessed artxa07412 iv substantive law of international sales 85 387 in the same way as those of the cisg see paraxa0129 above the rules of the upicc must be interpreted autonomously or in other words without having regard to the established legal terminology of national contract laws artxa0 16 paraxa0 1 gaps should be settled as far as possible not by recourse to domestic laws but in accordance with the general principles underlying the instrument artxa016 paraxa02 see paraxa0394 below 388 in a similar vein the upicc do not normally make it explicit if they deviate from established national doctrines of contract law articles 312 and 313 constitute a rare exception in that they clarify that domestic requirements as to indicia of seriousness such as the doctrines of consideration or cause or domestic views as to initial impossibility as an impediment to performance are irrelevant as potential grounds of invalidity artxa0313 389 most of the rules contained in the upicc are default rules they do not apply if the parties have agreed to the contrary only some of its provisions are mandatory and cannot be contracted out artxa015 these include the duty of the parties to act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing artxa017 the provisions of chapterxa03 on validity artxa0314 and the limits on the potential modification of limitation periods by the parties artxa0103 paraxa02 however given the nonbinding status of the upicc it may be impossible to enforce the mandatory character in a given case see paraxa0103 above 390 the nonbinding character of the upicc may also affect the application of their rules that are designed to deal with threeparty relationships such as agency chapxa02 sectxa02 contracts in favour of third parties chapxa05 sectxa02 assignment of rights transfer of obligations and assignment of contracts chapxa09 and plurality of obligors and obligees chapxa011 it may be the case that the relevant rule of the upicc will apply merely to one of the twoparty relationships that together con stitute the tripartite relationship for example the rules on agency may apply between the principal and the other party but not between the principal and the agent or between the agent and the other party 391 the upicc do not set forth a rule providing for the overt policing of unfair standard terms instead they contain a number of provisions that are designed to protect parties with less experience and inferior bargaining power these include the prohibition on invoking grossly unfair exemption clauses artxa0716 the reduc tion of grossly excessive penalty clauses artxa07413 the avoidance of the contract in cases of gross disparity artxa0327 the contra proferentem rule in the interpreta tion of contracts artxa0 46 and the ineffectiveness of surprising standard terms artxa02120 rules of this kind are notably absent from the cisg 86 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 12 how do the upicc interact with other uniform law instruments relationship with the cisg and the limitation convention 392 the upicc were drafted against the background of existing transnational commercial law which included the cisg and the limitation convention see paraxa0329 above since however the upicc are intended to provide a system of rules especially tailored to the needs of international commercial transactions they also embody what are perceived to be the best solutions even if still not yet gener ally adopted 393 when comparing the upicc with the cisg and the limitation conven tion three types of provisions may be distinguished a provisions addressing the same issues b provisions addressing the same subject matter but to a different level of detail and c provisions addressing issues excluded from the scope of appli cation of the cisg and the limitation convention it is specifically with regard to the second and the third of these that the function of the upicc as a means of interpreting and supplementing international uniform law instruments may be relevant see parasxa0351352 above 394 first some of the provisions address exactly the same issues as the conven tions they are usually taken either literally or at least in substance from the corre sponding rules of the conventions notable examples include the rules on offer and acceptance upicc arts 21211 and cisg arts 1424 see parasxa0157172 above on the foreseeability of harm upicc artxa0744 and cisg artxa074 see paraxa0273 above and on force majeure upicc artxa0717 and cisg artxa079 see paraxa0277 above in some instances the rules are virtually identical but there are slight if important differences both the cisg and the upicc for example con tain rules on the interpretation and supplementation of the instrument see parasxa0133137 above however in contrast to articlexa07 paragraphxa02 of the cisg articlexa016 paragraphxa02 of the upicc does not refer the adjudicator to domestic law as a last resort in cases where gaps cannot be filled by recourse to the general principles underlying the instrument both instruments consider the contractual parties to be bound to usages widely known to and regularly observed in inter national trade see parasxa0138142 above yet in contrast to articlexa09 paragraphxa02 of the cisg articlexa019 paragraphxa02 of the upicc does not require the parties actual or constructive knowledge of a particular usage to make it binding 395 second some of the provisions address subject matter that is also covered by the conventions this concerns many of the rules on formation damages and limitation periods in these cases there is a broad overlap between the upicc and the conventions although once again the former sometimes go beyond the iv substantive law of international sales 87 solutions of or are at least more explicit than the latter articlexa0211 of the upicc for example expressly recognizes that contracts may be concluded not only by the acceptance of an offer but also by other conduct of the parties that is sufficient to show agreement the upicc also contain specific rules on writings in confirma tion on cases where the parties made the conclusion of a contract dependent upon reaching an agreement on specific matters or in a specific form and on merger and nooralmodification clauses arts 211213 and 211718 none of which is expressly covered by the cisg moreover while the cisg only recognizes a role for good faith in international trade artxa07 paraxa01 the upicc set forth a general and farreaching duty of the parties to act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing throughout the life of the contract including the negotiations arts 17 18 and 2115 the rules on contractual interpretation in chapterxa04 of the upicc are substantially more detailed and comprehensive than those on the same topic in articlexa08 of the cisg with among others specific provisions on interpretation contra proferentem the interpretation of multilingual texts and gapfilling see parasxa0 133137 above the cisg does not contain specific rules on standard terms whereas the upicc contain a detailed set of provisions most importantly on the incorporation of such terms and the battle of the forms arts 211922 see parasxa0171172 above further issues covered by the upicc but not expressly covered by the cisg include exemption clauses artxa0 716 interest rates arts 74910 and agreed payment for nonperformance artxa0 7413 in rare cases the upicc deliberately depart from the previous conventions for example their general limitation period of three years artxa0102 differs from the fouryear period of articlexa08 of the limitation convention86 396 third many of the provisions of the upicc cover issues that are expressly excluded from the scope of application of the conventions such as the substantive validity of contracts chapxa03 see also artxa04 of the cisg and parasxa0119122 above or issues that are obviously beyond their scope the latter include the rules on the authority of agents chapxa02 sectxa02 contracts in favour of third parties chapxa05 sectxa02 setoff chapxa08 assignment of rights transfer of obligations and assignment of contracts chapxa09 and the plurality of obligors and obligees chapxa011 397 many but not all of these topics are dealt with because the upicc are not restricted to sales contracts but apply to all types of international commercial contracts some of the provisions that have no equivalent in the conventions are specifically tailored to service contracts not least longterm contracts and socalled relational contracts whereas the cisg and the limitation convention tend to focus on individual oneoff transactions these include the formation of contracts with terms deliberately left open artxa02114 the unwinding of failed contracts arts 3215 and 737 the duty of cooperation artxa0513 the determination of the quality of 86 see chapterxa0iv section b above for a comparison of provisions of the limitation convention and of the upicc 88 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts performance artxa0 516 the unilateral cancellation of contracts for an indefinite period artxa0518 and hardship arts 6213 in the 2016 edition of the upicc six existing articles and many of the existing comments were substantially amended to better address the special requirements of longterm contracts also in that edition a specific definition was provided in articlexa0111 of longterm contract as a contract which is to be performed over a period of time and which normally involves to a varying degree complexity of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between the parties relationship with the hcch principles 398 the hcch principles are particularly important for promoting the applica bility by agreement of the upicc this is achieved by articlexa03 of the hcch prin ciples one of the most innovative rules in the principles as discussed in chapterxa0iiib above articlexa03 furthers party autonomy by expressly permitting the choice of non state rules of law as the law governing the contract if such rules are generally accepted on an international supranational or regional level as a neutral and balanced set of rules in paragraphxa0 36 of the commentary on the hcch principles the upicc are explicitly mentioned as a prime example of such a set of rules 399 the hcch principles therefore offer a solution to the practice of many states that do not authorize their courts to give effect to the choice of the parties to make nonstate law the law governing the contract see parasxa05961 above d uniform rules on contract clauses for an agreedxa0 sum due upon failure of performance 400 international commercial contracts often include clauses providing that an agreed sum is to be paid upon failure to perform the nature of such payment may be compensation liquidated damages clauses or may be a penalty penalty clauses domestic laws vary on the treatment of such clauses particularly as to their validity the judges power to reduce the agreed sum and the possibility of claiming damages when the loss exceeds the agreed sum the uniform rules on contract clauses for an agreed sum due upon failure of performance 1983 prepared by uncitral are a softlaw instrument that provides uniform rules on those issues the instrument is contractual in nature and is applicable when the parties agree to incorporate it into their contract 401 the uniform rules apply to international contracts containing contract clauses for an agreed sum due upon failure to perform artxa01 for the purpose of the uniform rules a contract is international if the parties have their places of iv substantive law of international sales 89 business in different states artxa02 paraxa0a the definition of international is the same as in the cisg arts 2 and 3 see also arts 1 and 10 of the cisg the uniform rules do not apply to contracts concerning goods other property or services which are to be supplied for the personal family or household purposes of a party unless the other party at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract neither knew nor ought to have known that the contract was concluded for such purposes artxa04 402 the uniform rules do not make actual loss a requirement to claim the agreed sum but provide that the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum irrespective of the actual loss this rule is contained also in articlexa07413 paragraphxa01 of the upicc which indicates that the aggrieved party is entitled to that sum irrespec tive of its actual harm on the other hand under the uniform rules the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum only if the obligor is liable for the failure of perfor mance artxa05 thus for example if a party is exempt from liability according to articles 79 or 80 of the cisg that party need not pay the agreed sum even if there was an agreement to pay an agreed sum in the case of failure to perform the par ties may derogate from or vary the effect of this rule uniform rules artxa09 subject to validity rules under the applicable domestic law 1 relationship with right to specific performance 403 if the contract provides that the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum upon delay in performance the obligee is also entitled to performance of the obligation in addition to the agreed sum artxa0 6 paraxa0 1 if the contract provides that the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum upon a failure of performance other than delay the obligee is entitled either to performance eg repair of nonconforming goods or to the agreed sum if however the agreed sum cannot reasonably be regarded as compensation for that failure of performance the obligee is entitled to both performance of the obligation and the agreed sum artxa06 paraxa02 the parties may derogate from or vary the effect of this rule artxa09 2 relationship with right to damages 404 if the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum no damages may be claimed to the extent of the loss covered by the agreed sum nevertheless the obligee may claim damages to the extent of the loss not covered by the agreed sum if the loss substantially exceeds the agreed sum artxa0 7 the parties may derogate from or vary the effect of this rule artxa09 90 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts 3 reduction of the agreed sum by the court or arbitralxa0tribunal 405 in principle the court or arbitral tribunal does not have the power to reduce the agreed sum however the court or arbitral tribunal is granted the power to reduce the agreed sum if it is substantially disproportionate in relation to the loss that has been suffered by the obligee artxa0 8 the upicc adopt a similar rule artxa07413 paraxa02 this is a mandatory rule and the parties may not derogate from it or vary its effect uniform rules artxa09 e regional texts organization for the harmonization of business law in africa uniform act on general commercial law 406 commercial sale within the framework of the organization for the harmo nization of business law in africa ohada is provided for in articles 234302 of the ohada uniform act on general commercial law of 15 december 2010 407 based largely on the cisg the uniform acts provisions on commercial sale state that they apply to contracts for the sale of goods and that unless otherwise stipulated a commercial sales contract is subject to the provisions of the uniform act when the contracting parties have their main place of business in one of the states parties to ohada or when pil rules result in the application of the law of a state party 408 in addition to the substantive scope of application being the same for com mercial sale under ohada and the cisg sale of goods the two texts are also clearly and indisputably identical in respect of their rules on the formation of a contract the obligations of the parties to a contract for the sale of goods the effects of that contract and the rules governing nonperformance of the contract and the determination of related liability 409 when the parties to a contract have their main place of business in states parties to ohada the law applicable to the contract is the uniform act when the states parties to ohada are also parties to the cisg the uniform act remains applicable in accordance with articlexa010 of the ohada treaty on the harmoniza tion of business law in africa pursuant to which uniform acts are directly appli cable to and binding on the states parties the uniform act on general commercial law would only not be applicable if the parties to the contract had agreed on different provisions iv substantive law of international sales 91 f model contracts based on uniform texts 1 icc model international sales contract and developing neutral legal standards for international contracts 410 the icc produces a robust and wideranging series of international com mercial model contracts and clauses that provide a sound legal basis upon which global traders can quickly establish an evenhanded agreement acceptable to both sides in international transactions 411 the foundational pillars of the icc model contract series relate to global trade in goods including models on agency distributorship franchising and con fidentiality all the icc models are constructed to take balanced account of the interests of all the parties combining a single framework of rules with flexible provisions allowing the parties to insert their own requirements 412 the icc model contracts usually contain provisions on the applicable law and refer to international instruments as the default rule leaving it to the parties to modify this choice if they so prefer for example the icc model international sale contract manufactured goods published for the first time in 1997 and reviewed and updated in 2020 contains a reference to the application of the cisg in its general conditions articlexa012 in particular states that any questions which are not settled in the contract itself including agreed general conditions shall be governed by the cisg and to the extent that such questions are not covered by the cisg and no applicable law has been agreed upon by reference to the law of the sellers place of business parties wishing to choose a law other than that of the sellers place of business to govern questions not covered by the cisg are encour aged to do so in the first part of the model contract where individual terms can be negotiated it should also be highlighted that in drafting the terms of the con tract and general conditions themselves the icc used the cisg as the primary model for the default clauses 413 most of the other model contracts contain a reference to the application of general principles of commercial law and to the upicc for example according to articlexa0241 of the icc model contract on commercial agency any question not expressly or implicitly settled by contractual provisions shall be governed by the principles of law generally recognized in international trade as applicable to international agency contracts by the relevant trade usages and by the upicc in that order 414 the icc has also developed standalone clauses to address specific issues such as force majeure or hardship which influenced the language used by the 92 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts upicc provisions on regulating these issues see artxa0717 on force majeure and arts 621623 on hardship in turn the upicc have played a role in the most recent revision of such clauses particularly the hardship clause87 2 international trade centre guidance texts 415 the international trade centre has prepared a guide to preparing inter national commercial contracts88 as well as a compilation of model contracts89 those texts provide practical guidance on the conclusion of international commercial contracts focusing on the needs of small firms and making frequent reference to uniform texts such as the cisg and the upicc 3 international bar association drafting guide 416 bearing in mind the various requirements of international contracts and crossborder transactions and in particular the need to take into account several documents when drafting those contracts the international sales committee of the international bar association produced crossborder transactions a drafting guide for international sales contracts the goal of the guide is to offer practitioners and entrepreneurs a userfriendly checklist of the main issues to be taken into account 417 the guide is divided into 10 chapters dealing with among others preparing for a visit to the foreign country the substantive law on sales particularly focused on the cisg softlaw matters currency and payment issues export regulations resale in the importing country dispute resolution and tax treaties it also provides a specimen form of distribution agreement each chapterxa0contains short comments and a collection of websites to allow readers to

contracts a use of electronic means 418 the use of electronic information in contractual transactions including across borders has become prevalent for a number of reasons including speed of transmission ability to access data remotely and anytime and the possibility of reusing data it has also raised several issues with respect to the legal status of electronic information 419 uncitral has prepared texts that address contractual matters related to the use of electronic information those texts include the uncitral model law on electronic commerce 199690 the uncitral model law on electronic sig natures 200191 the electronic communications convention see parasxa0425430 below and the uncitral model law on electronic transferable records 201792 guidance texts have also been prepared by uncitral in the areas of crossborder recognition of electronic signatures93 and contractual aspects of cloud computing contracts94 420 uncitral texts on electronic commerce are based on the three funda mental principles a technology neutrality b nondiscrimination against the use of electronic information and c functional equivalence 421 the principle of technology neutrality requires that legislation not impose the use of or otherwise favour any specific technology method or product under the principle of nondiscrimination a communication is not to be denied validity on the sole ground that it is in electronic form under the principle of functional equivalence electronic communications may satisfy the purposes and functions of 90 united nations publication sales noxa0e99v4 91

original retention and transferable document or instrument 422 uncitral texts also provide rules on various aspects of electronic con tracting as well as on the use of electronic signatures which may perform functions additional to those fulfilled by paperbased signatures 423 in particular part one chapterxa0iii of the uncitral model law on elec tronic commerce deals with aspects directly relevant for electronic contracting such as formation and validity of contracts artxa0 11 recognition by parties artxa012 and attribution of data messages artxa013 including acknowledgment of their receipt artxa014 and time and place of dispatch and receipt of data messages artxa0 15 since a very large number of jurisdictions have already adopted the uncitral model law on electronic commerce the uniform law of electronic contracting set forth in those provisions has already gained broad acceptance 424 additional areas relevant for the use of electronic information in contractual transactions include privacy and data protection law consumer protection law the rules of which may also apply under certain circumstances to nonconsumers and payments law electronic communications convention and its relation to the cisg and the limitation convention 425 the electronic communications convention pursues several goals related to establishing legal certainty in the use of electronic communications across bor ders one of those goals is legally enabling the use of electronic communications in treaties concluded before the widespread use of electronic means 426 to that end it is declared in articlexa020 of the electronic communications convention that the provisions of that convention will apply to electronic com munications exchanged in connection with the formation or performance of a contract to which a number of treaties apply among the treaties listed in articlexa020 are the cisg and the limitation convention as well as the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 195895 as the list of treaties is not exhaustive the electronic communications convention may apply to any international agreement applicable to a contract concluded across borders 427 one effect of the interaction between the electronic communications convention on the one hand and the cisg and the limitation convention on 95 united nations treaty series volxa0330 noxa04739 v recurring legal issues arising in connection with sales contracts 95 the other is the extension to the latter treaties of the principles of technology neutrality nondiscrimination against the use of electronic information and func tional equivalence that underlie uncitral texts on electronic commerce 428 for instance articlexa09 of the electronic communications convention estab lishes the requirements for the functional equivalence between written and elec tronic form electronic communications compliant with those requirements will also satisfy written form requirements under the cisg when both the electronic communications convention and the cisg apply 429 articlexa06 of the electronic communications convention provides guidance on the determination of the place of business when electronic means are used the notion of place of business is relevant to determine the applicability of the cisg and of the limitation convention 430 the electronic communications convention also contains provisions rele vant for electronic contracting namely on a time and place of dispatch and receipt artxa0 10 updating artxa0 15 of the uncitral model law on electronic commerce b invitations to make offers artxa011 complementing artxa014 paraxa02 of the cisg c use of automated message systems artxa012 and d input errors made by natural persons artxa014 b distribution contracts 431 distribution contracts might respond to different kinds of modalities in busi ness practice basically under a distribution contract the supplier agrees to supply the distributor with goods on a continuing basis and the distributor agrees to pur chase them and to resell them to others in the distributors name and on the dis tributors behalf no uniform definition of a distribution contract and no uniform characterization exist either nationally or internationally domestically therefore such a contract can be considered as a modality or subtype of a sale of goods contract or an autonomous contract itself under a distribution contract the parties foresee a longterm relationship that is often cooperative see paragraphs 397 above and 433 below for the definition of longterm contracts under the upicc 432 in some distribution contracts apart from the obligation to distribute the goods certain other obligations are agreed between the parties such as obligations of marketing distribution and development of advertising or marketing of the goods noncompetition clauses technical assistance industrial or intellectual rights or the obligation to follow certain instructions from the supplier and finally exclusivity obligations exclusivity to sell or to buy within a certain territory or to a certain group of distributors or customers the obligation of exclusivity can take 96 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts the form of an obligation to buy the goods only from the supplier an obligation to sell exclusively to certain distributors that meet certain requirements or an obligation to supply to only one distributor in a territory or to supply to a certain group of customers 433 at the international level there is no dedicated uniform instrument dealing with distribution contracts at a more general level the upicc cover them as longterm contracts whose definition refers to a contract which is to be performed over a period of time and which normally involves to a varying degree complexity of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between the parties artxa011196 the upicc juxtapose longterm contracts with simpler transactions such as sales contracts to be performed once see also paraxa0397 above 434 most courts have concluded that the cisg does not apply to distribution contracts the socalled framework agreement as these contracts are focused on the organization of the distribution rather than the trade in goods however the cisg may apply to sale of goods contracts concluded on the basis of the distribu tion contract if all the conditions for the applicability internationality sale of goods etc of the cisg are met 435 furthermore although this interpretation is not settled the cisg has been applied to the framework agreement in situations in which the framework agree ment takes the form of a supply of goods agreement and contains the goods quan tity and price or the basis for the future determination of the quantity and price arts 8 9 14 paraxa01 and 55 if this is the case the contractual obligations derived from the framework agreement could be analysed under cisg rules including the exclusivity obligations without prejudice to other rules such as competition obliga tions being observed under the otherwise domestic applicable law since competi tion issues are not covered by the cisg 436 in the absence of a uniform international treaty in this area the parties might exclude the uncertainties derived from the application of the cisg to inter national distribution contracts by opting into the cisg alone or in conjunction with the upicc as the law or rules of law applicable to the contract opting in 96 comment 3 to artxa0111 upicc and several illustrations contained in the upicc refer to distribution contracts v recurring legal issues arising in connection with sales contracts 97 c agency 437 agency contracts might be defined as those contracts between principal and agent whereby the agent has authority or purports to have authority on behalf of another person the principal to conclude a contract of sale of goods with a third party see articlexa01 paragraphxa01 on the sphere of application of the convention on agency in the international sale of goods97 the hcch 1978 agency convention see parasxa05254 above and articlexa0221 paragraphxa01 of the upicc98 in this regard acting either in the name of the agent or in that of the principal is possible 438 generally the agent may act in relation not only to the conclusion of the international sale of goods contract but also to the performance of that contract hence certain provisions of the cisg may apply to the agent 439 during the formation of the contract the agent might be the one dealing with the offer or alternatively an invitation to make an offer cisg artxa014 paraxa01 in the latter situation this is the case if the agent does not have the authority to conclude the contract on behalf of the principal since the proposal cannot certainly contain an intention to be bound in the case of acceptance and so the agent will send the invitation to make an offer with a wording indicating no such intention for example without my consent or save acceptance by the principal 440 during the performance of the contract among other instances the agent might be the person who receives from the buyer the notice about the lack of conformity of the goods under articlexa039 paragraphxa01 of the cisg in those cir cumstances the problems related to the scope of authority of the agent should be resolved in accordance with the otherwise applicable domestic law or rules of law chosen by the parties 441 furthermore in relation to the field of application of the cisg particular challenges might arise in determining the application of the cisg arts 1 and 10 in particular in the case of undisclosed agency generally the place of business of the agent will not have the closest relationship to the contract and its performance but that would be the case in terms of the place of business of the principal 442 the upicc contain a fully fledged set of rules on agency in its chapterxa02 referring to the formation of the contract and covering the authority of the agent to affect the legal relations of the principal by or with respect to a contract with a 97 the convention which has not yet entered into force is aimed at supplementing the aspects of the agency rela tionship in an international sale of goods transaction between principal and agent that are not covered by the cisg 98 in fact the upicc intervened in this area for general contract law and replaced those rules with a more coherent and complete set of rules although of course nonbinding 98 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts third party whether the agent acts in the name of the agent or in that of the prin cipal the chapterxa0governs only the relations between the principal or the agent on the one hand and the third party on the other and it is not concerned with the internal relations between the principal and the agent which are governed by the contract and the otherwise applicable law it deals with the scope of the agency artxa0222 following the general rule that the granting of authority to the agent by the principal is not subject to any particular requirement of form and the rule that the scope of the authority is to perform all acts necessary to achieve the purposes for which the authority was granted the difference between disclosed and un disclosed agency arts 2234 the situation in which the agent acts with no authority or exceeds the authority including the possible ratification by the principal arts 2256 and 229 conflict of interests as a ground for avoidance of the contract artxa0227 appointment of a subagent which is considered to be within the implied authority of the agent artxa0 228 and termination of the authority artxa02210 the upicc in contrast to a number of legal systems do not distinguish between direct and indirect representation they do not refer to situations in which the agents authority is conferred by law or is derived from judicial authori zation and they do not prevail over special rules governing agents of companies under mandatory applicable laws in the case of conflict between those rules and the upicc rules see also parasxa0341 and 390 above d software data and intellectual property issues 443 transactions in digital information particularly when the information is de tached from the tangible medium on which the information is stored are a fairly new phenomenon and the legal framework is still an unsettled matter such trans actions began with the emergence of computer software as an independent subject matter of trade and quickly grew to include digital content such as music ebooks and applications there are different approaches among jurisdictions regarding the characterization of such transactions for the purposes of determining which legal regime is applicable some jurisdictions apply the law appli cable to the sale of goods either by direct application of governing statutes or by analogy others treat trans actions in digital information as ordinary contracts not governed by special regimes for the sale of goods or as licence contracts and some are developing a sui generis contract law applicable to transactions of digital content99 444 against this background the question of whether transactions in digital infor mation software computer programs applications music ebooks smart goods etc are within the scope of the cisg poses a challenge to the interpretation of the 99 see for example directive eu 2019770 of the european parliament and of the council of 20 may 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services v recurring legal issues arising in connection with sales contracts 99 cisg this issue was not foreseen when the cisg was adopted in 1980 different views are expressed the issue involves both the definition of goods eg the question of whether goods must be tangible and the nature of the transaction eg sale licence of property or access to data not protected by a property regime due con sideration must also be given to the desirability of achieving uniformity of law by a broad application of the cisg on the one hand and the desirability of developing a suitable rule tailored to changing modern information technology on the other 445 one issue that is generally agreed however is that transactions in digital information should be distinguished from transactions in the underlying intellectual property eg copyrights and patents if the information is protected by such a regime the party supplying the digital information whether it is the holder of the intellectual property of that information a person granted a licence to supply the digital information to a third person or a person with control over access to data that are not protected by intellectual property rules is merely granting the other party a right to use the digital information within the confines of their contract and the applicable intellectual property law the intellectual property may or may not be retained by the holder 446 intellectual property is to a large extent harmonized through international conventions such as the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works 1886100 the paris convention for the protection of industrial property 1883101 and the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights 1994102 however owing to the principle of territoriality it is the law of the territory in which intellectual property is protected that determines the extent of protection of intellectual property in international trade this causes the problem that rights in intellectual property are determined independently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the light of this problem articlexa0 42 of the cisg provides a uniform rule regarding which law is relevant in determining whether the goods infringe the intellectual property of a third person for the purpose of determining whether the seller has fulfilled the obligation to deliver goods free from any right or claim by a third party based on intellectual property 447 it should be noted as well that the american law institute and the european law institute have embarked on a joint project aimed at establishing principles to govern the emerging data economy in particular transactions in electronic data if that endeavour succeeds and the resulting softlaw document proves influential the result may be greater harmonization in the area and the possibility of future work by international organizations 100 united nations treaty series volxa0828 noxa011850 101 ibid volxa0828 noxa011851 102 ibid volxa01869 noxa031874 100 legal guide to uniform instruments in the area of international commercial contracts e countertrade and barter 448 in contracts for the sale of goods including those falling under the scope of the cisg the property over goods is transferred against the payment of a price in a currency however it may be also transferred in full or in part against transfer of property over other goods that contract is commonly referred to as barter 449 in 1992 uncitral adopted the legal guide on international countertrade transactions103 which provides guidance on contractual solutions to different types of countertrade transactions defined as transactions in which one party supplies goods services technology or other economic value to the second party and in return the first party purchases from the second party an agreed amount of goods services technology or other economic value the link between trans actions must be explicit under that guide countertrade transactions include barter counter purchase buyback and offset104 450 provided that they are of an international character and between commer cial parties barter and other countertrade transactions are clearly within the scope of application of the upicc see paraxa0354 above which is broader than that of the cisg 451 different views exist on the applicability of the provisions of the cisg to barter contracts elements such as the definition of the notion of price in the cisg may influence those views in general the provisions of the cisg have often been applied to barter contracts to the extent that the relevant issue is common to both sale of goods and barter contracts but have not been applied when the relevant issue has a different legal treatment in sale of goods and barter contracts 452 as far as uniform instruments of pil are concerned there seems to be consensus that instruments governing the law applicable to international sale of goods do not apply to contracts that involve the transfer of goods in exchange for something other than money instruments governing contracts more generally such as the rome i regulation do apply to barter etc but only as far as their general rules are concerned the specific rules for contracts of sale on the other hand do not apply 103 united nations publication sales noxa0e93v7 104 with regard to offsets namely contracts between a private and a public entity concluded as a condition for the sale of goods or

of the principles these principles set forth general rules for international commercial contracts they shall be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by them they may be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by general principles of law the lex mercatoria or the like they may be applied when the parties have not chosen any law to govern their contract they may be used to interpret or supplement international uniform law instruments they may be used to interpret or supplement domestic law they may serve as a model for national and international legislators chapter 1 general provisions article 11 freedom of contract the parties are free to enter into a contract and to determine its content article 12 no form required nothing in these principles requires a contract statement or any other act to be made in or evidenced by a particular form it may be proved by any means including witnesses article 13 binding character of contract a contract validly entered into is binding upon the parties it can only be modified or terminated in accordance with its terms or by agreement or as otherwise provided in these principles article 14 mandatory rules nothing in these principles shall restrict the application of mandatory rules whether of national international or supranational origin which are applicable in accordance with the relevant rules of private international law article 15 exclusion or modification by the parties the parties may exclude the application of these principles or derogate from or vary the effect of any of their provisions except as otherwise provided in the principles parties wishing to provide that their agreement be governed by the principles might use one of the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts see httpwwwunidroitorginstrumentscommercialcontractsupiccmodelclauses unidroit principles 2016 article 16 interpretation and supplementation of the principles 1 in the interpretation of these principles regard is to be had to their international character and to their purposes including the need to promote uniformity in their application 2 issues within the scope of these principles but not expressly settled by them are as far as possible to be settled in accordance with their underlying general principles article 17 good faith and fair dealing 1 each party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing in international trade 2 the parties may not exclude or limit this duty article 18 inconsistent behaviour a party cannot act inconsistently with an understanding it has caused the other party to have and upon which that other party reasonably has acted in reliance to its detriment article 19 usages and practices 1 the parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any practices which they have established between themselves 2 the parties are bound by a usage that is widely known to and regularly observed in international trade by parties in the particular trade concerned except where the application of such a usage would be unreasonable article 110 notice 1 where notice is required it may be given by any means appropriate to the circumstances 2 a notice is effective when it reaches the person to whom it is given 3 for the purpose of paragraph 2 a notice reaches a person when given to that person orally or delivered at that persons place of business or mailing address 4 for the purpose of this article notice includes a declaration demand request or any other communication of intention article 111 definitions in these principles court includes an arbitral tribunal where a party has more than one place of business the relevant place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract longterm contract refers to a contract which is to be performed over a period of time and which normally involves to a varying degree complexity of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between the parties obligor refers to the party who is to perform an obligation and obligee refers to the party who is entitled to performance of that obligation writing means any mode of communication that preserves a record of the information contained therein and is capable of being reproduced in tangible form unidroit principles 2016 article 112 computation of time set by parties 1 official holidays or nonbusiness days occurring during a period set by parties for an act to be performed are included in calculating the period 2 however if the last day of the period is an official holiday or a nonbusiness day at the place of business of the party to perform the act the period is extended until the first business day which follows unless the circumstances indicate otherwise 3 the relevant time zone is that of the place of business of the party setting the time unless the circumstances indicate otherwise chapter 2 formation and authority of agents section 1 formation article 211 manner of formation a contract may be concluded either by the acceptance of an offer or by conduct of the parties that is sufficient to show agreement article 212 definition of offer a proposal for concluding a contract constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance article 213 withdrawal of offer 1 an offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree 2 an offer even if it is irrevocable may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer article 214 revocation of offer 1 until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree before it has dispatched an acceptance 2 however an offer cannot be revoked a if it indicates whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise that it is irrevocable or b if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer article 215 rejection of offer an offer is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror article 216 mode of acceptance 1 a statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance 2 an acceptance of an offer becomes effective when the indication of assent reaches the offeror 3 however if by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage the offeree may indicate assent by unidroit principles 2016 performing an act without notice to the offeror the acceptance is effective when the act is performed article 217 time of acceptance an offer must be accepted within the time the offeror has fixed or if no time is fixed within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror an oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise article 218 acceptance within a fixed period of time a period of acceptance fixed by the offeror begins to run from the time that the offer is dispatched a time indicated in the offer is deemed to be the time of dispatch unless the circumstances indicate otherwise article 219 late acceptance delay in transmission 1 a late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without undue delay the offeror so informs the offeree or gives notice to that effect 2 if a communication containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless without undue delay the offeror informs the offeree that it considers the offer as having lapsed article 2110 withdrawal of acceptance an acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective article 2111 modified acceptance 1 a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counterof fer 2 however a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance unless the offeror without undue delay objects to the discrepancy if the offeror does not object the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance article 2112 writings in confirmation if a writing which is sent within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract and which purports to be a confirmation of the contract contains additional or different terms such terms become part of the contract unless they materially alter the contract or the recipient without undue delay objects to the discrepancy article 2113 conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on specific matters or in a particular form where in the course of negotiations one of the parties insists that the contract is not concluded until there is agreement on specific matters or in a particular form no contract is concluded before agreement is reached on those matters or in that form unidroit principles 2016 article 2114 contract with terms deliberately left open 1 if the parties intend to conclude a contract the fact that they intentionally leave a term to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the parties or by a third person does not prevent a contract from coming into existence 2 the existence of the contract is not affected by the fact that subsequently a the parties reach no agreement on the term b the party who is to determine the term does not do so or c the third person does not determine the term provided that there is an alternative means of rendering the term definite that is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the intention of the parties article 2115 negotiations in bad faith 1 a party is free to negotiate and is not liable for failure to reach an agreement 2 however a party who negotiates or breaks off negotiations in bad faith is liable for the losses caused to the other party 3 it is bad faith in particular for a party to enter into or continue negotiations when intending not to reach an agreement with the other party article 2116 duty of confidentiality where information is given as confidential by one party in the course of negotiations the other party is under a duty not to disclose that information or to use it improperly for its own purposes whether or not a contract is subsequently concluded where appropriate the remedy for breach of that duty may include compensation based on the benefit received by the other party article 2117 merger clauses a contract in writing which contains a clause indicating that the writing completely embodies the terms on which the parties have agreed cannot be contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior statements or agreements however such statements or agreements may be used to interpret the writing article 2118 modification in a particular form a contract in writing which contains a clause requiring any modification or termination by agreement to be in a particular form may not be otherwise modified or terminated however a party may be precluded by its conduct from asserting such a clause to the extent that the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on that conduct article 2119 contracting under standard terms 1 where one party or both parties use standard terms in concluding a contract the general rules on formation apply subject to articles 2120 2122 2 standard terms are provisions which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party and which are actually used without negotiation with the other party unidroit principles 2016 article 2120 surprising terms 1 no term contained in standard terms which is of such a character that the other party could not reasonably have expected it is effective unless it has been expressly accepted by that party 2 in determining whether a term is of such a character regard shall be had to its content language and presentation article 2121 conflict between standard terms and nonstandard terms in case of conflict between a standard term and a term which is not a standard term the latter prevails article 2122 battle of forms where both parties use standard terms and reach agreement except on those terms a contract is concluded on the basis of the agreed terms and of any standard terms which are common in substance unless one party clearly indicates in advance or later and without undue delay informs the other party that it does not intend to be bound by such a contract section 2 authority of agents article 221 scope of the section 1 this section governs the authority of a person the agent to affect the legal relations of another person the principal by or with respect to a contract with a third party whether the agent acts in its own name or in that of the principal 2 it governs only the relations between the principal or the agent on the one hand and the third party on the other 3 it does not govern an agents authority conferred by law or the authority of an agent appointed by a public or judicial authority article 222 establishment and scope of the authority of the agent 1 the principals grant of authority to an agent may be express or implied 2 the agent has authority to perform all acts necessary in the circumstances to achieve the purposes for which the authority was granted article 223 agency disclosed 1 where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent the acts of the agent shall directly affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party and no legal relation is created between the agent and the third party 2 however the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party where the agent with the consent of the principal undertakes to become the party to the contract unidroit principles 2016 article 224 agency undisclosed 1 where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party neither knew nor ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party 2 however where such an agent when contracting with the third party on behalf of a business represents itself to be the owner of that business the third party upon discovery of the real owner of the business may exercise also against the latter the rights it has against the agent article 225 agent acting without or exceeding its authority 1 where an agent acts without authority or exceeds its authority its acts do not affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party 2 however where the principal causes the third party reasonably to believe that the agent has authority to act on behalf of the principal and that the agent is acting within the scope of that authority the principal may not invoke against the third party the lack of authority of the agent article 226 liability of agent acting without or exceeding its authority 1 an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority is failing ratification by the principal liable for damages that will place the third party in the same position as if the agent had acted with authority and not exceeded its authority 2 however the agent is not liable if the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent had no authority or was exceeding its authority article 227 conflict of interests 1 if a contract concluded by an agent involves the agent in a conflict of interests with the principal of which the third party knew or ought to have known the principal may avoid the contract the right to avoid is subject to articles 329 and 3211 to 3215 2 however the principal may not avoid the contract a if the principal had consented to or knew or ought to have known of the agents involvement in the conflict of interests or b if the agent had disclosed the conflict of interests to the principal and the latter had not objected within a reasonable time article 228 subagency an agent has implied authority to appoint a subagent to perform acts which it is not reasonable to expect the agent to perform itself the rules of this section apply to the subagency article 229 ratification 1 an act by an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority may be ratified by the principal on ratification the act produces the same effects as if it had initially been carried out with authority 2 the third party may by notice to the principal specify a reasonable period of time for ratification if the principal does not ratify within that period of time it can no longer do so unidroit principles 2016 3 if at the time of the agents act the third party neither knew nor ought to have known of the lack of authority it may at any time before ratification by notice to the principal indicate its refusal to become bound by a ratification article 2210 termination of authority 1 termination of authority is not effective in relation to the third party unless the third party knew or ought to have known of it 2 notwithstanding

311 matters not covered this chapter does not deal with lack of capacity article 312 validity of mere agreement a contract is concluded modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties without any further requirement article 313 initial impossibility 1 the mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract the performance of the obligation assumed was impossible does not affect the validity of the contract 2 the mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract a party was not entitled to dispose of the assets to which the contract relates does not affect the validity of the contract article 314 mandatory character of the provisions the provisions on fraud threat gross disparity and illegality contained in this chapter are mandatory section 2 grounds for avoidance article 321 definition of mistake mistake is an erroneous assumption relating to facts or to law existing when the contract was concluded article 322 relevant mistake 1 a party may only avoid the contract for mistake if when the contract was concluded the mistake was of such importance that a reasonable person in the same situation as the party in error would only have concluded the contract on materially different terms or would not have concluded it at all if the true state of affairs had been known and unidroit principles 2016 a the other party made the same mistake or caused the mistake or knew or ought to have known of the mistake and it was contrary to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing to leave the mistaken party in error or b the other party had not at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the contract 2 however a party may not avoid the contract if a it was grossly negligent in committing the mistake or b the mistake relates to a matter in regard to which the risk of mistake was as sumed or having regard to the circumstances should be borne by the mistaken party article 323 error in expression or transmission an error occurring in the expression or transmission of a declaration is considered to be a mistake of the person from whom the declaration emanated article 324 remedies for nonperformance a party is not entitled to avoid the contract on the ground of mistake if the circumstances on which that party relies afford or could have afforded a remedy for nonperformance article 325 fraud a party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other partys fraudulent representation including language or practices or fraudulent nondisclosure of circumstances which according to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing the latter party should have disclosed article 326 threat a party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other partys unjustified threat which having regard to the circumstances is so imminent and serious as to leave the first party no reasonable alternative in particular a threat is unjustified if the act or omission with which a party has been threatened is wrongful in itself or it is wrongful to use it as a means to obtain the conclusion of the contract article 327 gross disparity 1 a party may avoid the contract or an individual term of it if at the time of the conclusion of the contract the contract or term unjustifiably gave the other party an excessive advantage regard is to be had among other factors to a the fact that the other party has taken unfair advantage of the first partys dependence economic distress or urgent needs or of its improvidence ignorance inexperience or lack of bargaining skill and b the nature and purpose of the contract 2 upon the request of the party entitled to avoidance a court may adapt the contract or term in order to make it accord with reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing 3 a court may also adapt the contract or term upon the request of the party receiving notice of avoidance provided that that party informs the other party of its request promptly after receiving such notice and before the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on it article 32102 applies accordingly unidroit principles 2016 article 328 third persons 1 where fraud threat gross disparity or a partys mistake is imputable to or is known or ought to be known by a third person for whose acts the other party is responsible the contract may be avoided under the same conditions as if the behaviour or knowledge had been that of the party itself 2 where fraud threat or gross disparity is imputable to a third person for whose acts the other party is not responsible the contract may be avoided if that party knew or ought to have known of the fraud threat or disparity or has not at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the contract article 329 confirmation if the party entitled to avoid the contract expressly or impliedly confirms the contract after the period of time for giving notice of avoidance has begun to run avoidance of the contract is excluded article 3210 loss of right to avoid 1 if a party is entitled to avoid the contract for mistake but the other party declares itself willing to perform or performs the contract as it was understood by the party entitled to avoidance the contract is considered to have been concluded as the latter party understood it the other party must make such a declaration or render such performance promptly after having been informed of the manner in which the party entitled to avoidance had understood the contract and before that party has reasonably acted in reliance on a notice of avoidance 2 after such a declaration or performance the right to avoidance is lost and any earlier notice of avoidance is ineffective article 3211 notice of avoidance the right of a party to avoid the contract is exercised by notice to the other party article 3212 time limits 1 notice of avoidance shall be given within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances after the avoiding party knew or could not have been unaware of the relevant facts or became capable of acting freely 2 where an individual term of the contract may be avoided by a party under article 327 the period of time for giving notice of avoidance begins to run when that term is asserted by the other party article 3213 partial avoidance where a ground of avoidance affects only individual terms of the contract the effect of avoidance is limited to those terms unless having regard to the circumstances it is unreasonable to uphold the remaining contract article 3214 retroactive effect of avoidance avoidance takes effect retroactively unidroit principles 2016 article 3215 restitution 1 on avoidance either party may claim restitution of whatever it has supplied under the contract or the part of it avoided provided that the party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received under the contract or the part of it avoided 2 if restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable 3 the recipient of the performance does not have to make an allowance in money if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attributable to the other party 4 compensation may be claimed for expenses reasonably required to preserve or maintain the performance received article 3216 damages irrespective of whether or not the contract has been avoided the party who knew or ought to have known of the ground for avoidance is liable for damages so as to put the other party in the same position in which it would have been if it had not concluded the contract article 3217 unilateral declarations the provisions of this chapter apply with appropriate adaptations to any commu nication of intention addressed by one party to the other section 3 illegality article 331 contracts infringing mandatory rules 1 where a contract infringes a mandatory rule whether of national international or supranational origin applicable under article 14 of these

indication to the contrary to have made reference to the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such performance in comparable circumstances in the trade concerned or if no such price is available to a reasonable price 2 where the price is to be determined by one party and that determination is manifestly unreasonable a reasonable price shall be substituted notwithstanding any contract term to the contrary 3 where the price is to be fixed by one party or a third person and that party or third person does not do so the price shall be a reasonable price 4

performance 1 the obligee may reject an earlier performance unless it has no legitimate interest in so doing 2 acceptance by a party of an earlier performance does not affect the time for the performance of its own obligations if that time has been fixed irrespective of the performance of the other partys obligations 3 additional expenses caused to the obligee by earlier performance are to be borne by the obligor without prejudice to any other remedy article 616 place of performance 1 if the place of performance is neither fixed by nor determinable from the contract a party is to

conclusion of the contract either party is entitled to terminate the contract 2 where the permission affects some terms only paragraph 1 does not apply if having regard to the circumstances it is reasonable to uphold the remaining contract even if the permission is refused article 6117 permission refused 1 the refusal of a permission affecting the validity of the contract renders the contract void if the refusal affects the validity of some terms only only such terms are void if having regard to the circumstances it is reasonable to uphold the remaining contract 2 where the refusal of a permission renders the performance of the contract impossible in whole or in part the rules on nonperformance apply unidroit principles 2016 section 2 hardship article 621 contract to be observed where the performance of a contract becomes more onerous for one of the parties that party is nevertheless bound to perform its obligations subject to the following provisions on hardship article 622 definition of hardship there is hardship where the occurrence of events fundamentally alters the equilib rium of the contract either because the cost of a partys performance has increased or because the value of the performance a party receives has diminished and a the events occur or become known to the disadvantaged party after the conclu sion of the contract b the events could not reasonably have been taken into account by the disadvan taged party at the time of the conclusion of the contract c the events are beyond the control of the disadvantaged party and d the risk of the events was not assumed by the disadvantaged party article 623 effects of hardship 1 in case of hardship the disadvantaged party is entitled to request renegotia tions the request shall be made without undue delay and shall indicate the grounds on which it is based 2 the request for renegotiation does not in itself entitle the disadvantaged party to withhold performance 3 upon failure to reach agreement within a reasonable time either party may resort to the court 4 if the court finds hardship it may if reasonable a terminate the contract at a date and on terms to be fixed or b adapt the contract with a view to restoring its equilibrium chapter 7 nonperformance section 1 nonperformance in general article 711 nonperformance defined nonperformance is failure by a party to perform any of its obligations under the contract including defective performance or late performance article 712 interference by the other party a party may not rely on the nonperformance of the other party to the extent that such nonperformance was caused by the first partys act or omission or by another event for which the first party bears the risk article 713 withholding performance 1 where the parties are to perform simultaneously either party may withhold performance until the other party tenders its performance unidroit principles 2016 2 where the parties are to perform consecutively the party that is to perform later may withhold its performance until the first party has performed article 714 cure by nonperforming party 1 the nonperforming party may at its own expense cure any nonperformance provided that a without undue delay it gives notice indicating the proposed manner and timing of the cure b cure is appropriate in the circumstances c the aggrieved party has no legitimate interest in refusing cure and d cure is effected promptly 2 the right to cure is not precluded by notice of termination 3 upon effective notice of cure rights of the aggrieved party that are inconsistent with the nonperforming partys performance are suspended until the time for cure has expired 4 the aggrieved party may withhold performance pending cure 5 notwithstanding cure the aggrieved party retains the right to claim damages for delay as well as for any harm caused or not prevented by the cure article 715 additional period for performance 1 in a case of nonperformance the aggrieved party may by notice to the other party allow an additional period of time for performance 2 during the additional period the aggrieved party may withhold performance of its own reciprocal obligations and may claim damages but may not resort to any other remedy if it receives notice from the other party that the latter will not perform within that period or if upon expiry of that period due performance has not been made the ag grieved party may resort to any of the remedies that may be available under this chapter 3 where in a case of delay in performance which is not fundamental the aggrieved party has given notice allowing an additional period of time of reasonable length it may terminate the contract at the end of that period if the additional period allowed is not of reasonable length it shall be extended to a reasonable length the aggrieved party may in its notice provide that if the other party fails to perform within the period allowed by the notice the contract shall automatically terminate 4 paragraph 3 does not apply where the obligation which has not been performed is only a minor part of the contractual obligation of the nonperforming party article 716 exemption clauses a clause which limits or excludes one partys liability for nonperformance or which permits one party to render performance substantially different from what the other party reasonably expected may not be invoked if it would be grossly unfair to do so having regard to the purpose of the contract article 717 force majeure 1 nonperformance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences unidroit principles 2016 2 when the impediment is only temporary the excuse shall have effect for such period as is reasonable having regard to the effect of the impediment on the performance of the contract 3 the party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on its ability to perform if the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment it is liable for damages resulting from such non receipt 4 nothing in this article prevents a party from exercising a right to terminate the contract or to withhold performance or request interest on money due section 2 right to performance article 721 performance of monetary obligation where a party who is obliged to pay money does not do so the other party may re quire payment article 722 performance of nonmonetary obligation where a party who owes an obligation other than one to pay money does not per form the other party may require performance unless a performance is impossible in law or in fact b performance or where relevant

e the party entitled to performance does not require performance within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become aware of the nonperformance article 723 repair and replacement of defective performance the right to performance includes in appropriate cases the right to require repair replacement or other cure of defective performance the provisions of articles 721 and 722 apply accordingly article 724 judicial penalty 1 where the court orders a party to perform it may also direct that this party pay a penalty if it does not comply with the order 2 the penalty shall be paid to the aggrieved party unless mandatory provisions of the law of the forum provide otherwise payment of the penalty to the aggrieved party does not exclude any claim for damages article 725 change of remedy 1 an aggrieved party who has required performance of a nonmonetary obliga tion and who has not received performance within a period fixed or otherwise within a reasonable period of time may invoke any other remedy 2 where the decision of a court for performance of a nonmonetary obligation cannot be enforced the aggrieved party may invoke any other remedy unidroit principles 2016 section 3 termination article 731 right to terminate the contract 1 a party may terminate the contract where the failure of the other party to perform an obligation under the contract amounts to a fundamental nonperformance 2 in determining whether a failure to perform an obligation amounts to a funda mental nonperformance regard shall be had in particular to whether a the nonperformance substantially deprives the aggrieved party of what it was entitled to expect under the contract unless the other party did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen such result b strict compliance with the obligation which has not been performed is of essence under the contract c the nonperformance is intentional or reckless d the nonperformance gives the aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot rely on the other partys future performance e the nonperforming party will suffer disproportionate loss as a result of the preparation or performance if the contract is terminated 3 in the case of delay the aggrieved party may also terminate the contract if the other party fails to perform before the time allowed it under article 715 has expired article 732 notice of termination 1 the right of a party to terminate the contract is exercised by notice to the other party 2 if performance has been offered late or otherwise does not conform to the contract the aggrieved party will lose its right to terminate the contract unless it gives notice to the other party within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become aware of the offer or of the nonconforming performance article 733 anticipatory nonperformance where prior to the date for performance by one of the parties it is clear that there will be a fundamental nonperformance by that party the other party may terminate the contract article 734 adequate assurance of due performance a party who reasonably believes that there will be a fundamental nonperformance by the other party may demand adequate assurance of due performance and may meanwhile withhold its own performance where this assurance is not provided within a reasonable time the party demanding it may terminate the contract article 735 effects of termination in general 1 termination of the contract releases both parties from their obligation to effect and to receive future performance 2 termination does not preclude a claim for damages for nonperformance 3 termination does not affect any provision in the contract for the settlement of disputes or any other term of the contract which is to operate even after termination unidroit principles 2016 article 736 restitution with respect to contracts to be performed at one time 1 on termination of a contract to be performed at one time either party may claim restitution of whatever it has supplied under the contract provided that such party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received under the contract 2 if restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable 3 the recipient of the performance does not have to make an allowance in money if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attributable to the other party 4 compensation may be claimed for expenses reasonably required to preserve or maintain the performance received article 737 restitution with respect to longterm contracts 1 on termination of a longterm contract restitution can only be claimed for the period after termination has taken effect provided the contract is divisible 2 as far as restitution has to be made the provisions of article 736 apply section 4 damages article 741 right to damages any nonperformance gives the aggrieved party a right to damages either exclusively or in conjunction with any other remedies except where the non performance is excused under these principles article 742 full compensation 1 the aggrieved party is entitled to full compensation for harm sustained as a result of the nonperformance such harm includes both any loss which it suffered and any gain of which it was deprived taking into account any gain to the aggrieved party resulting from its avoidance of cost or harm 2 such harm may be nonpecuniary and includes for instance physical suffering or emotional distress article 743 certainty of harm 1 compensation is due only for harm including future harm that is established with a reasonable degree of certainty 2 compensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence 3 where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty the assessment is at the discretion of the court article 744 foreseeability of harm the nonperforming party is liable only for harm which it foresaw or could reasonably have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract as being likely to result from its nonperformance unidroit principles 2016 article 745 proof of harm in case of replacement transaction where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has made a replacement transaction within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner it may recover the difference between the contract price and the price of the replacement transaction as well as damages for any further harm article 746 proof of harm by current price 1 where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has not made a replacement transaction but there is a current price for the performance contracted for it may recover the difference between the contract price and the price current at the time the contract is terminated as well as damages for any further harm 2 current price is the price generally charged for goods delivered or services rendered in comparable circumstances at the place where the contract should have been performed or if there is no current price at that place the current price at such other place that appears reasonable to take as a reference article 747 harm due in part to aggrieved party where the harm is due in part to an act or omission of the aggrieved party or to an other event for which that party bears the risk the amount of damages shall be reduced to the extent that these factors have contributed to the harm having regard to the conduct of each of the parties article 748 mitigation of harm 1 the nonperforming party is not liable for harm suffered by the aggrieved party to the extent that the harm could have been reduced by the latter partys taking reasonable steps 2 the aggrieved party is entitled to recover any expenses reasonably incurred in attempting to reduce the harm article 749 interest for failure to pay money 1 if a party does not pay a sum of money when it falls due the aggrieved party is entitled to interest upon that sum from the time when payment is due to the time of payment whether or not the nonpayment is excused 2 the rate of interest shall be the average bank shortterm lending rate to prime borrowers prevailing for the currency of payment at the place for payment or where no such rate exists at that place then the same rate in the state of the currency of payment in the absence of

faria alberto mazzoni secretarygeneral president vii introduction to the 2016 edition when approving previous editions of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts the governing council emphasised the need for the secretariat to monitor the use of the principles in actual practice and to inquire with the international legal and business communities whether new topics should be considered for inclusion in future editions consistent with this instruction following the adoption of the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts in 2013 the secretariat drew the governing councils attention to longterm contracts and the possibility of future work on the principles in this area the 2016 edition of the unidroit principles is not intended as a revision of the previous editions as amply demonstrated by the extensive body of case law and bibliographic references on the unilex database wwwunilexinfo the unidroit principles

xxi foreword to the 2004 edition it is with the utmost pleasure that we present this new edition of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts which comes exactly ten years after the appearance of the first edition we would like first of all to express the institutes deepest appreciation and gratitude to the members of the working group and observers for their achievement and among them especially to the rapporteurs on the various chapters it was only on account of their outstanding competence and extraordinary efforts again so proficiently coordinated by michael joachim bonell that this new edition was made possible we would also like to thank all those who have over the last years through their scholarly writings on the unidroit principles or by applying them in practice contributed to their great success their comments and practical experience have been an inestimable source of inspiration to the working group in its deliberations it is our hope that they will continue their support and will also share with us in the future their experience with the unidroit principles last but by no means least our gratitude also goes to the unidroit secretariat in particular to ms paula howarth and ms lena peters for their invaluable editorial assistance and to ms marina schneider for her efficiency in looking after the french version in cooperation with the francophone members of the working group herbert kronke berardino libonati secretarygeneral president xxii introduction to the 2004 edition when the governing council decided in 1994 to publish the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts it stressed the need to monitor their use with a view to their possible reconsideration at some time in the future three years later work was resumed with a view to preparing a second edition of the unidroit principles to this end a working group was set up composed of eminent jurists representing the major legal systems andor regions of the world some of its members had already participated in the preparation of the 1994 edition of the unidroit principles while for the first time representatives of interested international organisations and arbitration centres or associations were invited to attend the working groups sessions as observers the new edition of the unidroit principles appearing ten years after the first edition is not intended as a revision of the 1994 edition as is amply demonstrated by the extensive body of case law and bibliography reported in the unilex database wwwunilexinfo the unidroit principles have generally met with approval and have not given rise in practice to any significant difficulties of application consequently only very few amendments of substance were made to the 1994 text and these were moreover limited with one exception to the comments indeed the only blackletter rule amended was article 282 which has now become article 112 as to the comments comment 3 to article 13 comments 1 and 2 to article 17 comment 2 to article 215 now 2115 and comment 2 to article 622 were substantially revised or expanded however it was decided to consider whether and if so to what extent the 1994 edition of the unidroit principles required additions or amendments to adapt it to the increasingly important practice of electronic contracting eventually only a few changes were made to this effect to the black letter rules see article 12 article 281 now 218 article 218 now 2118 while more changes were made to the comments and illustrations see comment 1 to article 12 comments 1 and 4 to article 19 now 110 and illustrations comment 3 to article 21 now 211 and illustration comment to article 27 now 217 and illustration comment to article 28 now 218 introduction 2004

completion of the drawing up of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts this achievement represents the outcome of many years of intensive research and deliberations involving the participation of a large number of eminent lawyers from all five continents of the world tribute must first be paid to the members of the working group primarily entrusted with the preparation of the unidroit principles and among them especially to the rapporteurs for the different chapters without their personal commitment and unstinting efforts so ably coordinated throughout by michael joachim bonell this ambitious project could not have been brought to its successful conclusion we must also express gratitude for the most valuable input given by the numerous practising lawyers judges civil servants and academics from widely differing legal cultures and professional backgrounds who became involved in the project at various stages of the drafting process and whose constructive criticism was of the greatest assistance in this moment of great satisfaction for the institute we cannot but evoke the memory of mario matteucci who for so many years served unidroit as secretarygeneral and then as president and whose belief in the principles as a vital contribution to the process of international unification of law was a source of constant inspiration to us all malcolm evans riccardo monaco secretarygeneral president xxviii introduction to the 1994 edition efforts towards the international unification of law have hitherto essentially taken the form of binding instruments such as supranational legislation or international conventions or of model laws since these instruments often risk remaining little more than a dead letter and tend to be rather fragmentary in character calls are increasingly being made for recourse to nonlegislative means of unification or harmonisation of law some of those calls are for the further development of what is termed international commercial custom for example through model clauses and contracts formulated by the interested business circles on the basis of current trade practices and relating to specific types of transactions or particular aspects thereof others go even further and advocate the elaboration of an international restatement of general principles of contract law unidroits initiative for the elaboration of principles of international commercial contracts goes in that direction it was as long ago as 1971 that the governing council decided to include this subject in the work programme of the institute a small steering committee composed of professors ren david clive m schmitthoff and tudor popescu representing the civil law the common law and the socialist systems was set up with the task of conducting preliminary inquiries into the feasibility of such a project it was not until 1980 however that a special working group was constituted for the purpose of preparing the various draft chapters of the principles the group which included representatives of all the major legal systems of the world was composed of leading experts in the field of contract law and international trade law most of them were academics some high ranking judges or civil servants who all sat in a personal capacity the group appointed from among its members rapporteurs for the different chapters of the unidroit principles who were entrusted with the task of submitting successive drafts together with comments these were then discussed by the group and circulated to a wide range of experts including unidroits extensive network of correspondents in addition the governing council offered its advice on the policy to be followed especially in those cases where the group had found it difficult to reach a consensus the necessary editorial work was entrusted to an editorial committee assisted by the secretariat introduction 1994 xxix for the most part the unidroit principles reflect concepts to be found in many if not all legal systems since however the unidroit principles are intended to provide a system of rules especially tailored to the needs of international commercial transactions they also embody what are perceived to be the best solutions even if still not yet generally adopted the objective of the unidroit principles is to establish a balanced set of rules designed for use throughout the world irrespective of the legal traditions and the economic and political conditions of the countries in which they are to be applied this goal is reflected both in their formal presentation and in the general policy underlying them as to their formal presentation the unidroit principles deliberately seek to avoid the use of terminology peculiar to any given legal system the international character of the unidroit principles is also stressed by the fact that the comments accompanying each single provision systematically refrain from referring to national laws in order to explain the origin and rationale of the solution retained only where the rule has been taken over more or less literally from the world wide accepted united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods cisg is explicit reference made to its source with regard to substance the unidroit principles are sufficiently flexible to take account of the constantly changing circumstances brought about by the technological and economic developments affecting crossborder trade practice at the same time they attempt to ensure fairness in international commercial relations by expressly stating the general duty of the parties to act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing and in a number of specific instances imposing standards of reasonable behaviour naturally to the extent that the unidroit principles address issues also covered by cisg they follow the solutions found in that convention with such adaptations as were considered appropriate to reflect the particular nature and scope of the principles in offering the unidroit principles to the international legal and business communities the governing council is fully conscious of the fact that the unidroit principles which do not involve the endorsement of governments are not a binding instrument and that in consequence their acceptance will depend upon their persuasive authority there are a number of significant ways in which the unidroit principles may see especially arts 18 19 22 in conjunction with arts 57 and 722 unidroit principles xxx find practical application the most important of which are amply explained in the preamble the governing council is confident that those to whom the unidroit principles are addressed will appreciate their intrinsic merits and derive full advantage from their use the governing council of unidroit rome may 1994 xxxi the unidroit governing council 19941998 riccardo monaco president of unidroit mer i akipek turkey antonio boggiano

forth general rules for international commercial contracts they shall be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by them they may be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by general principles of law the lex mercatoria or the like they may be applied when the parties have not chosen any law to govern their contract they may be used to interpret or supple ment international uniform law instruments they may be used to interpret or supple ment domestic law they may serve as a model for national and international legislators comment the principles set forth general rules which are basically conceived for international commercial contracts 1 international contracts the international character of a contract may be defined in a great variety of ways the solutions adopted in both national and international legislation range from a reference to the place of business or habitual residence of the parties in different countries to the adoption of more general criteria such as the contract having significant connections with more than one state involving a choice between the laws of different states or affecting the interests of international trade the principles do not expressly lay down any of these criteria the assumption however is that the concept of international contracts parties wishing to provide that their agreement be governed by the principles might use one of the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts see wwwunidroitorginstrumentscommercial contractsupiccmodelclauses unidroit principles 2 should be given the broadest possible interpretation so as ultimately to exclude only those situations where no international element at all is involved ie where all the relevant elements of the contract in question are connected with one country only 2 commercial contracts the restriction to commercial contracts is in no way intended to take over the distinction traditionally made in some legal systems between civil and commercial parties andor transactions ie to make the application of the principles dependent on whether the parties have the formal status of merchants commerants kaufleute andor the transaction is commercial in nature the idea is rather that of excluding from the scope of the principles socalled consumer transactions which within the various legal systems are increasingly being subjected to special rules mostly of a mandatory character aimed at protecting the consumer ie a party who enters into the contract otherwise than in the course of its trade or profession the principles were originally conceived mainly for ordinary exchange contracts such as sales contracts to be performed at one time in view of the increasing importance of more complex transactions in particular longterm contracts the principles have subsequently been adapted to take into account also the characteristics and needs of these transactions for a definition of the notion of longterm contract see article 111 3 the principles and domestic contracts between private persons notwithstanding the fact that the principles are conceived for international commercial contracts there is nothing to prevent private persons from agreeing to apply the principles to a purely domestic contract any such agreement would however be subject to the mandatory rules of the domestic law governing the contract 4 the principles as rules of law governing the contract a express choice by the parties as the principles represent a system of principles and rules of contract law which are common to existing national legal systems or best adapted to the special requirements of international commercial transactions there might be good reasons for the parties to choose them expressly as the rules of law governing their contract in so doing the parties may refer to the principles exclusively or in conjunction with a preamble 3 particular domestic law which should apply to issues not covered by the principles see the reference to the model clauses in the footnote to the second paragraph of the preamble parties who wish to choose the principles as the rules of law governing their contract are well advised to combine such a choice of law clause with an arbitration agreement the reason for this is that the freedom of choice of the parties in designating the law governing their contract is traditionally limited to national laws but see now article 3 of the 2015 hague conference on private international laws principles on choice of law in international commercial contracts subject to certain limitations therefore a reference by the parties to the principles will normally be considered to be a mere agreement to incorporate them in the contract while the law governing the contract will still have to be determined on the basis of the private international law rules of the forum as a result the principles will bind the parties only to the extent that they do not affect the rules of the applicable law from which the parties may not derogate see comment 3 on article 14 the situation is different if the parties agree to submit disputes arising from their contract to arbitration arbitrators are not necessarily bound by a particular domestic law this is selfevident if they are authorised by the parties to act as amiable compositeurs or ex aequo et bono but even in the absence of such an authorisation parties are generally permitted to choose rules of law other than national laws on which the arbitrators are to base their decisions see in particular article 281 of the 1985 uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration see also article 421 of the 1965 convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states icsid convention in line with this approach the parties would be free to choose the principles as the rules of law according to which the arbitrators would decide the dispute with the result that the principles would apply to the exclusion of any particular national law subject only to the application of those rules of domestic law which are mandatory irrespective of which law governs the contract see comment 4 on article 14 in disputes falling under the icsid convention the principles might even be applicable to the exclusion of any domestic rule of law b the principles applied as a manifestation of general principles of law the lex mercatoria or the like referred to in the contract parties to international commercial contracts who cannot agree on the choice of a particular domestic law as the law applicable to their contract sometimes provide that it shall be governed by the general unidroit principles 4 principles of law by the usages and customs of international trade by the lex mercatoria etc hitherto such reference by the parties to not better identified principles and rules of a supranational or transnational character has been criticised among other grounds because of the extreme vagueness of such concepts in order to avoid or at least to reduce considerably the uncertainty accompanying the use of such rather vague concepts it might be advisable in order to determine their content to have recourse to a systematic and welldefined set of rules such as the principles c the principles applied in the absence of any choice of law by the parties the principles may however be applied even if the contract is silent as to the applicable law if the parties have not chosen the law governing their contract it has to be determined on the basis of the relevant rules of private international law in the context of international commercial arbitration such rules are very flexible permitting arbitral tribunals to apply the rules of law which they determine to be appropriate see eg article 211 of the 2012 rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce article 241 of the arbitration rules of the arbitration institute of the stockholm chamber of commerce normally arbitral tribunals will apply a particular domestic law as the proper law of the contract yet exceptionally they may resort to a national or supranational rules such as the principles this may occur when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the parties intended to exclude the application of any domestic law eg where one of the parties is a state or a government agency and both parties have made it clear that neither would accept the application of the others domestic law or that of a third country or when the contract presents connecting factors with many countries none of which is predominant enough to justify the application of one domestic law to the exclusion of all the others 5 the principles as a means of interpreting and supplementing international uniform law instruments international uniform law instruments may give rise to questions concerning the precise meaning of their individual provisions and may present gaps traditionally international uniform law has been interpreted on the basis of and supplemented by principles and criteria of domestic law be it the law of the forum or that which would according to the relevant preamble 5 rules of private international law be applicable in the absence of an international uniform law recently both courts and arbitral tribunals have increasingly abandoned such a conflictual approach seeking instead to interpret and supplement international uniform law by reference to autonomous and internationally uniform principles and criteria this approach expressly sanctioned for instance in article 7 of the 1980 un convention on contracts for the international sale of goods cisg is based on the assumption that international uniform law even after its incorporation into the various national legal systems only formally becomes an integrated part of the latter whereas from a substantive point of view it does not lose its original character of a special body of law autonomously developed at international level and intended to be applied in a uniform manner throughout the world until now such autonomous principles and criteria for the interpretation and supplementing of international uniform law instruments have had to be found in each single case by the judges and arbitrators themselves on the basis of a comparative survey of the solutions adopted in the different national legal systems the principles could considerably facilitate their task in this respect 6 the principles as a means of interpreting and supplementing domestic law the principles may also be used to interpret and supplement domestic law in applying a particular domestic law courts and arbitral tribunals may be faced with doubts as to the proper solution to be adopted under that law either because different alternatives are available or because there seem to be no specific solutions at all especially where the dispute relates to an international commercial contract it may be advisable to resort to the principles as a source of inspiration by so doing the domestic law in question would be interpreted and supplemented in accordance with internationally accepted standards andor the special needs of crossborder trade relationships 7 the principles as a model for national and international legislators in view of their intrinsic merits the principles may in addition serve as a model to national and international lawmakers for the drafting of legislation in the field of general contract law or with respect to special types of transaction at a national level the principles may be particularly useful to those countries which lack a developed body of unidroit principles 6 legal rules relating to contracts and which intend to update their law at least with respect to foreign economic relationships to current international standards not too different is the situation of those countries with a welldefined legal system but which after the dramatic changes in their sociopolitical structure have an urgent need to rewrite their laws in particular those relating to economic and business activities at an international level the principles could become an important term of reference for the drafting of conventions and model laws so far the terminology used to express the same concept differs considerably from one instrument to another with the obvious risk of misunderstandings and misinterpretations such inconsistencies could be avoided if the terminology of the principles were to be adopted as an international uniform glossary 8 other possible uses of the principles the list set out in the preamble of the different ways in which the principles may be used is not exhaustive thus the principles may also serve as a guide for drafting contracts in particular the principles facilitate the identification of the issues to be addressed in the contract and provide a neutral legal terminology equally understandable by all the parties involved such a use of the principles is enhanced by the fact that they are available in a large number of languages the principles may also be used as a substitute for the domestic law otherwise applicable this is the case whenever it proves impossible or extremely difficult to establish the relevant rule of that particular domestic law with respect to a specific issue ie it would entail disproportionate efforts andor costs the reasons for this generally lie in the special character of the legal sources of the domestic law in question andor the cost of accessing them furthermore the principles may be used as course material in universities and law schools thereby promoting the teaching of contract law on a truly comparative basis 7 chapter 1 general provisions article 11 freedom of contract the parties are free to enter into a contract and to determine its content comment 1 freedom of contract as a basic principle in the context of international trade the principle of freedom of contract is of paramount importance in the context of international trade the right of business people to decide freely to whom they will offer their goods or services and by whom they wish to be supplied as well as the possibility for them freely to agree on the terms of individual transactions are the cornerstones of an open marketoriented and competitive international economic order 2 economic sectors where there is no competition there are of course a number of possible exceptions to the principle laid down in this article as concerns the freedom to conclude contracts with any other person there are economic sectors which states may decide in the public interest to exclude from open competition in such cases the goods or services in question can only be requested from the one available supplier which will usually be a public body and which may or may not be under a duty to conclude a contract with whoever makes a request within the limits of the availability of the goods or services 3 limitation of party autonomy by mandatory rules with respect to the freedom to determine the content of the contract in the first instance the principles themselves contain provisions from which the parties may not derogate see article 15 art 12 unidroit principles 8 moreover there are mandatory rules whether of national inter national or supranational origin which if applicable in accordance with the relevant rules of private international law prevail over the provisions contained in the principles and from which the parties cannot derogate see article 14 article 12 no form required nothing in these principles requires a contract statement or any other act to be made in or evidenced by a particular form it may be proved by any means including witnesses comment 1 contracts as a rule not subject to formal requirements this article states the principle that the conclusion of a contract is not subject to any requirement as to form the same principle also applies to the subsequent modification or termination of a contract by agreement of the parties the principle which is to be found in many although not in all legal systems seems particularly appropriate in the context of international trade relationships where thanks to modern means of communication many transactions are concluded at great speed and by a mixture of conversations telefaxes paper contracts email and web communication the first sentence of the article takes into account the fact that some legal systems regard requirements as to form as matters relating to substance while others impose them for evidentiary purposes only the second sentence is intended to make it clear that to the extent that the principle of freedom of form applies it implies the admissibility of oral evidence in judicial proceedings 2 statements and other unilateral acts the principle of no requirement as to form applies also to statements and other unilateral acts the most important such acts are statements of intent made by parties either in the course of the formation or performance of a contract eg an offer acceptance of an offer confirmation of the contract by the party entitled to avoid it general provisions art 13 9 determination of the price by one of the parties etc or in other contexts eg the grant of authority by a principal to an agent the ratification by a principal of an act performed by an agent without authority the obligors acknowledgement of the obligees right before the expiration of the general limitation period etc 3 possible exceptions under the applicable law the principle of no requirement as to form may of course be overridden by the applicable law see article 14 national laws as well as international instruments may impose special requirements as to form with respect either to the contract as a whole or to individual terms eg arbitration agreements choice of court agreements 4 form requirements agreed by the parties moreover the parties may themselves agree on a specific form for the conclusion modification or termination of their contract or for any other statement they may make or unilateral act they may perform in the course of the formation or performance of their contract or in any other context in this connection see in particular articles 2113 2117 and 2118 article 13 binding character of contract a contract validly entered into is binding upon the parties it can only be modified or terminated in accordance with its terms or by agreement or as otherwise provided in these principles comment 1 the principle pacta sunt servanda this article lays down another basic principle of contract law that of pacta sunt servanda art 13 unidroit principles 10 the binding character of a contractual agreement obviously presupposes that an agreement has actually been concluded by the parties and that the agreement reached is not affected by any ground of invalidity the rules governing the conclusion of contractual agreements are laid down in chapter 2 section 1 of the principles while the grounds of invalidity are dealt with in chapter 3 as well as in individual provisions in other chapters see eg articles 716 and 74132 additional requirements for the valid conclusion of contracts may be found in the applicable national or international mandatory rules 2 exceptions a corollary of the principle of pacta sunt servanda is that a contract may be modified or terminated whenever the parties so agree modification or termination without agreement are on the contrary the exception and can therefore be admitted only when in conformity with the terms of the contract or when expressly provided for in the principles see articles 3272 3273 3210 518 6116 623 717 731 and 733 3 effects on third persons by stating the principle of the binding force of the contract between the parties this article does not intend to prejudice any effect which that contract may have visvis third persons under the applicable law thus a seller may in some jurisdictions be under a contractual duty to protect the physical integrity and property not only of the buyer but also of accompanying persons during their presence on the sellers premises similarly the principles do not deal with the effects of avoidance and termination of a contract on the rights of third persons with respect to cases where the agreement between the parties by its very nature is intended to affect the legal relations of other persons see section 2 of chapter 2 on authority of agents section 2 of chapter 5 on third party rights chapter 9 on assignment of rights transfer of obligations assignment of contracts and chapter 11 on plurality of obligors and obligees general provisions art 14 11 article 14 mandatory rules nothing in these principles shall restrict the application of mandatory rules whether of national international or supranational origin which are applicable in accordance with the relevant rules of private international law comment 1 mandatory rules prevail given the particular nature of the principles as a nonlegislative instrument neither the principles nor individual contracts concluded in accordance with the principles can be expected to prevail over mandatory rules of domestic law whether of national international or supranational origin that are applicable in accordance with the relevant rules of private international law mandatory rules of national origin are those enacted by states autonomously eg particular form requirements for specific types of contracts invalidity of penalty clauses licensing requirements environmental regulations etc while mandatory rules of international or supranational origin are those derived from international conventions or general public international law eg haguevisby rules unidroit convention on stolen or illegally exported cultural objects united nations convention against corruption united nations universal declaration of human rights etc or adopted by supranational organisations eg european union competition law etc 2 broad notion of mandatory rules the mandatory rules referred to in this article are predominantly laid down by specific legislation and their mandatory nature may either be expressly stated or inferred by way of interpretation however in the various national legal systems restrictions on freedom of contract may also derive from general principles of public policy whether of national international or supranational origin eg prohibition of commission or inducement of crime prohibition of corruption and collusive bidding protection of human dignity prohibition of discrimination on the basis of gender race or religion prohibition of undue restraint of trade etc for the purpose of this article the notion of mandatory rules is to art 14 unidroit principles 12 be understood in a broad sense so as to cover both specific statutory provisions and general principles of public policy 3 mandatory rules applicable in case of incorporation of the principles as terms of contract where as is the traditional and still prevailing approach adopted by domestic courts with respect to soft law instruments the parties reference to the principles is considered to be merely an agreement to incorporate them in the contract see comment 4 lit a third paragraph to the preamble the principles and the individual contracts concluded in accordance with the principles will first of all encounter the limit of the principles and rules of the domestic law that govern the contract from which parties may not contractually derogate socalled ordinary or domestically mandatory rules moreover the mandatory rules of the forum state and possibly of other countries may also apply if the mandatory rules claim application irrespective of what the law governing the contract is and in the case of the mandatory rules of other countries there is a sufficiently close connection between those countries and the contract in question socalled overriding or internationally mandatory rules 4 mandatory rules applicable in case of reference to the principles as law governing the contract where as may be the case if the dispute is brought before an arbitral tribunal the principles are applied as the law governing the contract see comment 4 lit a fourth paragraph to the preamble they no longer encounter the limit of the ordinary mandatory rules of any domestic law as far as the overriding mandatory rules of the forum state or of other countries are concerned their application basically depends on the circumstances of the case generally speaking since in international arbitration the arbitral tribunal lacks a predetermined lex fori it may but is under no duty to apply the overriding mandatory rules of the country on the territory of which it renders the award in determining whether to take into consideration the overriding mandatory rules of the forum state or of any other country with which the case at hand has a significant connection the arbitral tribunal bearing in mind its task to make every effort to make sure that the award is enforceable at law so expressly eg article 41 of the 2012 icc arbitration rules may be expected to pay particular attention to the overriding mandatory rules general provisions art 15 13 of those countries where enforcement of the award is likely to be sought moreover the arbitral tribunal may consider it necessary to apply those overriding mandatory rules that reflect principles widely accepted as fundamental in legal systems throughout the world so called transnational public policy or ordre public transnational 5 recourse to rules of private international law relevant in each given case in view of the considerable differences in the ways in which domestic courts and arbitral tribunals determine the mandatory rules applicable to international commercial contracts this article deliberately refrains from stating which mandatory rules apply and the article refers instead to the relevant rules of private international law for the solution in each given case see eg article 9 of ec regulation no 5932008 rome i replacing article 7 of the 1980 rome convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations article 11 of the 1994 interamerican convention on the law applicable to international contracts article 11 of the 2015 principles on choice of law in international commercial contracts of the hague conference on private international law articles 28 34 and 36 of the uncitral model law on international commercial arbitration and article v of the new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards article 15 exclusion or modification by the parties the parties may exclude the application of these principles or derogate from or vary the effect of any of their provisions except as otherwise provided in the principles comment 1 the nonmandatory character of the principles the rules laid down in the principles are in general of a non mandatory character ie the parties may in each individual case either simply exclude their application in whole or in part or modify their content so as to adapt them to the specific needs of the kind of art 15 unidroit principles 14 transaction involved see the model clauses referred to in the footnote to the second paragraph of the preamble 2 exclusion or modification may be express or implied the exclusion or modification of the principles by the parties may be either express or implied there is an implied exclusion or modification when the parties expressly agree on contract terms which are inconsistent with provisions of the principles and it is in this context irrelevant whether the terms in question have been negotiated individually or form part of standard terms incorporated by the parties in their contract if the parties expressly agree to the application of some only of the chapters of the principles eg as far as the performance and non performance of this contract is concerned the unidroit principles shall apply it is presumed that the chapters concerned will be applied together with the general provisions of chapter 1 3 mandatory provisions to be found in the principles a few provisions of the principles are of a mandatory character ie their importance in the system of the principles is such that parties should not be permitted to exclude or to derogate from them as they wish it is true that given the particular nature of the principles the non observance of this precept may have no consequences on the other hand it should be noted that the provisions in question reflect principles and standards of behaviour which are of a mandatory character under most domestic laws also those provisions of the principles which are mandatory are normally expressly indicated as such this is the case with article 17 on good faith and fair dealing with the provisions of chapter 3 on substantive validity except in so far as they relate or apply to mistake and to initial impossibility see article 314 with article 5172 on price determination with article 74132 on agreed payment for non performance and article 1032 on limitation periods exceptionally the mandatory character of a provision is only implicit and follows from the content and purpose of the provision itself see eg articles 18 and 716 general provisions art 16 15 article 16 interpretation and supplementation of the principles 1 in the interpretation of these principles regard is to be had to their international character and to their purposes including the need to promote uniformity in their application 2 issues within the scope of these principles but not expressly settled by them are as far as possible to be settled in accordance with their underlying general principles comment 1 interpretation of the principles as opposed to interpretation of the contract the principles like any other legal text be it of a legislative or of a contractual nature may give rise to doubts as to the precise meaning of their content the interpretation of the principles is however different from that of the individual contracts to which they apply even if the principles are considered to bind the parties only at contractual level ie their application is made dependent on their incorporation in individual contracts they remain an autonomous set of rules worked out with a view to their application in a uniform manner to an indefinite number of contracts of different type entered into in various parts of the world as a consequence they must be interpreted in a different manner from the terms of each individual contract the rules for the interpretation of contracts as well as of statements by or other conduct of the parties are laid down in chapter 4 this article deals with the manner in which the principles as such are to be interpreted 2 regard to the international character of the principles the first criterion laid down by this article for the interpretation of the principles is that regard is to be had to their international character this means that their terms and concepts are to be interpreted autonomously ie in the context of the principles them selves and not by reference to the meaning which might traditionally be attached to them by a particular domestic law art 16 unidroit principles 16 such an approach becomes necessary if it is recalled that the principles are the result of thorough comparative studies carried out by lawyers coming from totally different cultural and legal backgrounds when drafting the individual provisions these experts had to find sufficiently neutral legal language on which they could reach a common understanding even in the exceptional cases where terms or concepts peculiar to one or more national laws are employed the intention was never to use them in their traditional meaning 3 purposes of the principles by stating that in the interpretation of the principles regard is to be had to their purposes this article makes it clear that they are not to be construed in a strict and literal sense but in the light of the purposes and the rationale underlying the individual provisions as well as the principles as a whole the purpose of the individual provisions can be ascertained both from the text itself and from the comments thereon as to the purposes of the principles as a whole this article in view of the fact that the principles main objective is to provide a uniform framework for international commercial contracts expressly refers to the need to promote uniformity in their application ie to ensure that in practice they are to the greatest possible extent interpreted and applied in the same way in different countries as to other purposes see the remarks contained in the introduction see further article 17 which although addressed to the parties may also be seen as an expression of the underlying purpose of the principles as such to promote the observance of good faith and fair dealing in contractual relations 4 supplementation of the principles a number of issues which would fall within the scope of the principles are not settled expressly by them in order to determine whether an issue is one that falls within the scope of the principles even though it is not expressly settled by them or whether it actually falls outside their scope regard is to be had first to what is expressly stated either in the text or in the comments see eg comment 3 on article 13 comment 5 on article 14 article 2212 and 3 and comment 5 on article 221 comment 5 on article 227 comment 5 on article 229 comment 1 on article 2210 article 311 comment 1 on article 6114 article 912 article 922 article 932 a useful additional guide in this respect is the subjectmatter index of the principles general provisions art 17 17 the need to promote uniformity in the application of the principles implies that when such gaps arise a solution should be found whenever possible within the system of the principles itself before resorting to domestic laws the first step is to attempt to settle the unsolved question through an application by analogy of specific provisions thus article 616 on place of performance should also govern restitution similarly the rules laid down in article 619 with respect to the case where a monetary obligation is expressed in a currency other than that of the place for payment may also be applied when the monetary obligation is expressed by reference to units of account such as the special drawing right sdr if the issue cannot be solved by a mere extension of specific provisions dealing with analogous cases recourse must be made to their underlying general principles ie to the principles and rules which may be applied on a much wider scale because of their general character some of these fundamental principles are expressly stated in the principles see eg articles 11 13 15 17 and 18 others have to be extracted from specific provisions ie the particular rules contained therein must be analysed in order to see whether they can be considered an expression of a more general principle and as such capable of being applied also to cases different from those specifically regulated parties are of course always free to agree on a particular national law to which reference should be made for the supplementing of the principles a provision of this kind could read this contract is governed by the unidroit principles supplemented by the law of country x or this contract shall be interpreted and executed in accordance with the unidroit principles questions not expressly settled therein shall be settled in accordance with the law of country x see the model clauses referred to in the footnote to the second paragraph of the preamble article 17 good faith and fair dealing 1 each party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing in international trade 2 the parties may not exclude or limit this duty art 17 unidroit principles 18 comment 1 good faith and fair dealing as a fundamental idea underlying the principles there are a number of provisions throughout the different chapters of the principles which constitute a direct or indirect application of the principle of good faith and fair dealing see above all article 18 but see also for instance articles 192 2142b 2115 2116 2118 and 2120 2242 2252 227 and 2210 322 325 and 327 412 422 46 and 48 512 and 513 525 533 and 534 613 615 61162 and 61171 62334 712 716 and 717 722bc 748 and 7413 913 914 and 91101 this means that good faith and fair dealing may be considered to be one of the fundamental ideas underlying the principles by stating in general terms that each party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing paragraph 1 of this article makes it clear that even in the absence of special provisions in the principles the parties behaviour throughout the life of the contract including the negotiation process must conform to good faith and fair dealing i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a grants b fortyeight hours as the time within which b may accept its offer when b shortly before the expiry of the deadline decides to accept it is unable to do so it is the weekend the fax at as office is disconnected and there is no telephone answering machine which can take the message when on the following monday a refuses bs acceptance a acts contrary to good faith since when it fixed the timelimit for acceptance it was for a to ensure that messages could be received at its office throughout the fortyeight hour period 2 a contract for the supply and installation of a special production line contains a provision according to which a the seller is obliged to communicate to b the purchaser any improvements made by a to the technology of that line after a year b learns of an important improvement of which it had not been informed a is not excused by the fact that the production of that particular type of production line is no longer its responsibility but that of c a wholly owned affiliated company of a it would be against good faith for a to invoke the separate entity of c which was specifically set up to take over this production in order to avoid as contractual obligations visvis b 3 a an agent undertakes on behalf of b the principal to promote the sale of bs goods in a given area under the contract as right to compensation arises only after bs approval of the contracts procured general provisions art 17 19 by a while b is free to decide whether or not to approve the contracts procured by a a systematic and unjustified refusal to approve any contract procured by a would be against good faith 4 under a line of credit agreement between a a bank and b a customer a suddenly and inexplicably refuses to make further advances to b whose business suffers heavy losses as a consequence notwithstanding the fact that the agreement contains a term permitting a to accelerate payment at will as demand for payment in full without prior warning and with no justification would be against good faith 2 abuse of rights a typical example of behaviour contrary to the principle of good faith and fair dealing is what in some legal systems is known as abuse of rights it is characterised by a partys malicious behaviour which occurs for instance when a party exercises a right merely to damage the other party or for a purpose other than the one for which it had been granted or when the exercise of a right is disproportionate to the originally intended result i l l u s t r a t i o n s 5 a rents premises from b for the purpose of setting up a retail business the rental contract is for five years but when three years later a realises that business in the area is very poor it decides to close the business and informs b that it is no longer interested in renting the premises as breach of contract would normally lead to bs having the choice of either terminating the contract and claiming damages or requesting specific performance however under the circumstances b would be abusing its rights if it required a to pay the rent for the remaining two years of the contract instead of terminating the contract and claiming damages from a for the rent it has lost for the length of time necessary to find a new tenant 6 a rents premises from b for the purpose of opening a restaurant during the summer months a sets up a few tables out of doors but still on the owners property on account of the noise caused by the restaurants customers late at night b has increasing difficulties finding tenants for apartments in the same building b would be abusing its rights if instead of requesting a to desist from serving out of doors late at night it required a not to serve out of doors at all 3 good faith and fair dealing in international trade the reference to good faith and fair dealing in international trade first makes it clear that in the context of the principles the two concepts are not to be applied according to the standards ordinarily adopted art 17 unidroit principles 20 within the different national legal systems in other words such domestic standards may be taken into account only to the extent that they are shown to be generally accepted among the various legal systems a further implication of the formula used is that good faith and fair dealing must be construed in the light of the special conditions of international trade standards of business practice may indeed vary considerably from one trade sector to another and even within a given trade sector they may be more or less stringent depending on the socio economic environment in which the enterprises operate their size and technical skill etc it should be noted that whenever the provisions of the principles andor the comments thereto refer only to good faith and fair dealing such references should always be understood as a reference to good faith and fair dealing in international trade as specified in this article i l l u s t r a t i o n s 7 under a contract for the sale of hightechnology equipment the purchaser loses the right to rely on any defect in the goods if it does not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the defect without undue delay after it has discovered or ought to have discovered the defect a a buyer operating in a country where such equipment is commonly used discovers a defect in the equipment after having put it into operation but in its notice to b the seller of the equipment a gives misleading indications as to the nature of the defect a loses its right to rely on the defect since a more careful examination of the defect would have permitted it to give b the necessary specifications 8 the facts are the same as in illustration 7 except that a operates in a country where this type of equipment is so far almost unknown a does not lose its right to rely on the defect because b being aware of as lack of technical knowledge could not reason ably have expected a properly to identify the nature of the defect 4 the mandatory nature of the principle of good faith and fair dealing the parties duty to act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing is of such a fundamental nature that the parties may not contractually exclude or limit it paragraph 2 as to specific applications of the general prohibition to exclude or limit the principle of good faith and fair dealing between the parties see articles 314 716 and 7413 general provisions art 18 21 on the other hand nothing prevents parties from providing in their contract for a duty to observe more stringent standards of behaviour see eg article 533 article 18 inconsistent behaviour a party cannot act inconsistently with an understanding it has caused the other party to have and upon which that other party reasonably has acted in reliance to its detriment comment 1 inconsistent behaviour and good faith and fair dealing this provision is a general application of the principle of good faith and fair dealing article 17 it is reflected in other more specific provisions of the principles see for example articles 2142b 2118 2120 2252 and comment 3 on article 104 it imposes a responsibility on a party not to occasion detriment to another party by acting inconsistently with an understanding concerning their contractual relationship which it has caused that other party to have and upon which that other party has reasonably acted in reliance the prohibition contained in this article can result in the creation of rights and in the loss suspension or modification of rights otherwise than by agreement of the parties this is because the understanding relied upon may itself be inconsistent with the agreed or actual rights of the parties the article does not provide the only means by which a right might be lost or suspended because of one partys conduct see for example articles 329 and 7143 2 an understanding reasonably relied upon there is a variety of ways in which one party may cause the other party to have an understanding concerning their contract its performance or enforcement the understanding may result for example from a representation made from conduct or from silence when a party would reasonably expect the other to speak to correct a known error or misunderstanding that was being relied upon art 18 unidroit principles 22 so long as it relates in some way to the contractual relationship of the parties the understanding for the purposes of this article is not limited to any particular subjectmatter it may relate to a matter of fact or of law to a matter of intention or to how one or other of the parties can or must act the important limitation is that the understanding must be one on which in the circumstances the other party can and does reasonably rely whether the reliance is reasonable is a matter of fact in the circumstances having regard in particular to the communications and conduct of the parties to the nature and setting of the parties dealings and to the expectations they could reasonably entertain of each other i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a has negotiated with b over a lengthy period for a contract of lease of bs land under which b is to demolish a building and construct a new one to as specification a communicates with b in terms that induce b reasonably to understand that their contract negotiations have been completed and that b can begin perform ance b then demolishes the building and engages contractors to build the new building a is aware of this and does nothing to stop it a later indicates to b that there are additional terms still to be negotiated a will be precluded from departing from bs understanding 2 b mistakenly understands that its contract with a can be performed in a particular way a is aware of this and stands by while bs performance proceeds b and a meet regularly bs performance is discussed but no reference is made by a to bs mistake a will be precluded from insisting that the performance was not that which was required under the contract 3 a regularly uses b to do subcontract work on building sites that part of as business and the employees involved in it are taken over by a1 a related business there is no change in the general course of business by which b obtains its instruction to do work b continues to provide subcontract services and continues to bill a for work done believing the work is being done for a a does not inform b of its mistake a is precluded from denying that bs contract for work done is with it and must pay for the work done 4 because of difficulties it is experiencing with its own suppliers a is unable to make deliveries on time to b under their contract the contract imposes penalties for late delivery after being made aware of as difficulties b indicates it will not insist on strict compliance with the delivery schedule a year later bs business begins to suffer from as late deliveries b seeks to recover penalties for the late deliveries to date and to require compliance with the delivery schedule for the future it will be precluded from recovering the general provisions art 18 23 penalties but will be able to insist on compliance with the schedule if reasonable notice is given that compliance is required for the future 5 b is indebted to a in the sum of aud 10000 though the debt is due a takes no steps to enforce it b assumes in consequence that a has pardoned the debt a has done nothing to indicate that such actually is the case it later demands payment b cannot rely on as inaction to resist that demand 3 detriment and preclusion the responsibility imposed by the article is to avoid detriment being occasioned in consequence of reasonable reliance this does not necessarily require that the party seeking to act inconsistently must be precluded from so doing preclusion is only one way of avoiding detriment there may in the circumstances be other reasonable means available that can avert the detriment the relying party would otherwise experience if the inconsistent action were allowed as for example by giving reasonable notice before acting inconsistently see illustration 4 or by paying for costs or losses incurred by reason of reliance i l l u s t r a t i o n s 6 a and b are parties to a construction contract which requires that additional works be documented in writing and be certified by the site architect as contract manager orally requests b to do specified additional work on a time and materials basis and assures b it will be documented appropriately in due course b commissions design works for the additional work at which stage a indicates that the work is not required the cost incurred in commissioning the design work is far less than the cost that would be incurred if the additional work were to be done if a pays b the costs incurred by b for the design work b cannot then complain of as inconsistent behaviour 7 a fails to meet on time a prescribed milestone in a software development contract with b b is entitled under the contract to terminate the contract because of that failure b continues to require and pay for changes to the software and acts cooperatively with a in continuing the software development program as continued performance is based on bs conduct subsequent to the breach b will in such circumstances be precluded from exercising its right to terminate for the failure to meet the milestone however under the principles b will be able to allow a an additional period of time for performance see article 715 and to exercise its right to terminate if the milestone is not met in that period art 19 unidroit principles 24 article 19 usages and practices 1 the parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any practices which they have established between themselves 2 the parties are bound by a usage that is widely known to and regularly observed in international trade by parties in the particular trade concerned except where the application of such a usage would be unreasonable comment 1 practices and usages in the context of the principles this article lays down the principle according to which the parties are in general bound by practices and usages which meet the requirements set forth in the article furthermore these same requirements must be met by practices and usages for them to be applicable in the cases and for the purposes expressly indicated in the principles see for instance articles 2163 43 and 512 2 practices established between the parties a practice established between the parties to a particular contract is automatically binding except where the parties have expressly excluded its application whether a particular practice can be deemed to be established between the parties will naturally depend on the circumstances of the case but behaviour on the occasion of only one previous transaction between the parties will not normally suffice i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a supplier has repeatedly accepted claims from b a customer for quantitative or qualitative defects in the goods as much as two weeks after their delivery when b gives another notice of defects after a fortnight a cannot object that it is too late since the twoweeks notice amounts to a practice established between a and b which will as such be binding on a general provisions art 19 25 3 agreed usages by stating that the parties are bound by usages to which they have agreed paragraph 1 of this article merely applies the general principle of freedom of contract laid down in article 11 indeed the parties may either negotiate all the terms of their contract or for certain questions simply refer to other sources including usages the parties may stipulate the application of any usage including a usage developed within a trade sector to which neither party belongs or a usage relating to a different type of contract it is even conceivable that the parties will agree on the application of what sometimes misleadingly are called usages ie a set of rules issued by a particular trade association under the title of usages but which only in part reflects established general lines of conduct 4 other applicable usages paragraph 2 lays down the criteria for the identification of usages applicable in the absence of a specific agreement by the parties the fact that the usage must be widely known to and regularly observed by parties in the particular trade concerned is a condition for the application of any usage be it at international or merely at national or local level the additional qualification in international trade is intended to avoid usages developed for and confined to domestic transactions also being invoked in transactions with foreigners i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a a real estate agent invokes a particular usage of the profession in its country visvis b a foreign customer b is not bound by such a usage if that usage is of a local nature and relates to a trade which is predominantly domestic in character only exceptionally may usages of a purely local or national origin be applied without any reference thereto by the parties thus usages existing on certain commodity exchanges or at trade exhibitions or ports should be applicable provided that they are regularly followed with respect to foreigners as well another exception concerns the case of a businessperson who has already entered into a number of similar contracts in a foreign country and who should therefore be bound by the usages established within that country for such contracts art 19 unidroit principles 26 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 a a terminal operator invokes a particular usage of the port where it is located visvis b a foreign carrier b is bound by this local usage if the port is normally used by foreigners and the usage in question has been regularly observed with respect to all customers irrespective of their place of business and of their nationality 4 a a sales agent from country x receives a request from b one of its customers in country y for the customary 10 discount upon payment of the price in cash a may not object to the application of such a usage on account of its being restricted to country y if a has been doing business in that country for a certain period of time 5 application of usage unreasonable a usage may be regularly observed by the generality of business people in a particular trade sector but its application in a given case may nevertheless be unreasonable reasons for this may be found in the particular conditions in which one or both parties operate andor the atypical nature of the transaction in such cases the usage will not be applied i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a usage exists in a commodity trade sector according to which the purchaser may not rely on defects in the goods if they are not duly certified by an internationally recognised inspection agency when a a buyer takes over the goods at the port of destination the only internationally recognised inspection agency operating in that port is on strike and to call another from the nearest port would be excessively costly the application of the usage in this case would be unreasonable and a may rely on the defects it has discovered even though they have not been certified by an internationally recognised inspection agency 6 usages prevail over the principles both courses of dealing and usages once they are applicable in a given case prevail over conflicting provisions contained in the principles the reason for this is that they bind the parties as implied terms of the contract as a whole or of single statements or other conduct on the part of one of the parties as such they are superseded by any express term stipulated by the parties but in the same way as the latter they prevail over the principles the only exception being those provisions which are specifically declared to be of a mandatory character see comment 3 on article 15 general provisions art 110 27 article 110 notice 1 where notice is required it may be given by any means appropriate to the circumstances 2 a notice is effective when it reaches the person to whom it is given 3 for the purpose of paragraph 2 a notice reaches a person when given to that person orally or delivered at that persons place of business or mailing address 4 for the purpose of this article notice includes a declaration demand request or any other communication of intention comment 1 form of notice this article first lays down the principle that notice or any other kind of communication of intention declarations demands requests etc required by individual provisions of the principles are not subject to any particular requirement as to form but may be given by any means appropriate in the circumstances which means are appropriate will depend on the actual circumstances of the case in particular on the availability and the reliability of the various modes of communication and the importance andor urgency of the message to be delivered for an electronic notice to be appropriate to the circumstances the addressee must expressly or impliedly have consented to receive electronic communications in the way in which the notice was sent by the sender ie of that type in that format and to that address the addressees consent may be inferred from the addressees statements or conduct from practices established between the parties or from applicable usages i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 seller a and buyer b have a longstanding business relationship in the course of which they have always negotiated and concluded their contracts by telephone on discovering a defect in the goods supplied on one occasion b immediately sends a notice thereof by email a who does not regularly read its email and had no reason art 110 unidroit principles 28 to expect an email from b on discovering bs notice three weeks after it had been sent rejects it as being too late b may not object that it had given prompt notice of the defects since the notice was not given by a means appropriate to the circumstances 2 seller a and buyer b have a longstanding business relationship in the course of which they have regularly communicated by electronic means on discovering a defect in the goods supplied on one occasion b immediately sends a notice thereof by email to an email address different from the one normally used a who had no reason to expect an email from b at that address on discovering bs notice three weeks after it had been sent rejects it as being too late b may not object that it had given prompt notice of the defects since the notice was not given by a means appropriate to the circumstances 2 receipt principle with respect to all kinds of notices the principles adopt the socalled receipt principle ie they are not effective unless and until they reach the person to whom they are given for some communications this is expressly stated in the provisions dealing with them see articles 2131 2132 215 2162 2181 and 2110 9110 and 9111 the purpose of paragraph 2 of this article is to indicate that the same will also be true in the absence of an express statement to this effect see articles 219 2111 229 3210 3211 6116 623 715 717 721 722 732 734 and 83 3 dispatch principle to be expressly stipulated the parties are of course always free expressly to stipulate the application of the dispatch principle this may be appropriate in particular with respect to the notice a party has to give in order to preserve its rights in cases of the other partys actual or anticipated non performance when it would not be fair to place the risk of loss mistake or delay in the transmission of the message on the former this is all the more true if the difficulties which may arise at international level in proving effective receipt of a notice are borne in mind 4 reaches it is important in relation to the receipt principle to determine precisely when the communications in question reach the addressee in an attempt to define the concept paragraph 3 of this article draws a distinction between oral and other communications the former reach the addressee if they are made personally to it or to another person authorised by it to receive them the latter reach the addressee as general provisions art 111 29 soon as they are delivered either to the addressee personally or to its place of business or electronic mailing address the particular communication in question need not come into the hands of the addressee or actually be read by the addressee it is sufficient that it be handed over to an employee of the addressee authorised to accept it or that it be placed in the addressees mailbox or received by the addressees fax or telex machine or in the case of electronic communications when it becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at an electronic address designated by the addressee see article 102 of the 2005 united nations convention on the use of electronic communications in international contracts article 111 definitions in these principles court includes an arbitral tribunal where a party has more than one place of business the relevant place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract longterm contract refers to a contract which is to be performed over a period of time and which normally involves to a varying degree complexity of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between the parties obligor refers to the party who is to perform an obligation and obligee refers to the party who is entitled to performance of that obligation writing means any mode of commun ication that preserves a record of the information contained therein and is capable of being reproduced in tangible form art 111 unidroit principles 30 comment 1 courts and arbitral tribunals the importance of the principles for the purpose of the settlement of disputes by means of arbitration has already been stressed see above the comments on the preamble in order however to avoid undue heaviness of language only the term court is used in the text of the principles on the understanding that it covers arbitral tribunals as well as courts 2 party with more than one place of business for the purpose of the application of the principles a partys place of business is of relevance in a number of contexts such as the place for the delivery of notices see article 1103 a possible extension of the time of acceptance because of a holiday falling on the last day see article 112 the place of performance article 616 and the determination of the party who should apply for a public permission article 6114a with reference to a party with multiple places of business normally a central office and various branch offices this article lays down the rule that the relevant place of business should be considered to be that which has the closest relationship to the contract and to its performance nothing is said with respect to the case where the place of the conclusion of the contract and that of performance differ but in such a case the latter would seem to be the more relevant one in the determination of the place of business which has the closest relationship to a given contract and to its performance regard is to be had to the circumstances known to or contemplated by both parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract facts known only to one of the parties or of which the parties became aware only after the conclusion of the contract cannot be taken into consideration 3 longterm contracts the principles both in the blackletter provisions and the comments refer to longterm contracts as distinguished from ordinary exchange contracts such as sales contracts to be performed at one time three elements typically distinguish longterm contracts from ordinary exchange contracts duration of the contract an ongoing relationship between the parties and complexity of the transaction for the purpose of the principles the essential element is the duration of the contract while the latter two elements are normally present to varying degrees general provisions art 111 31 but are not required the extent to which if at all one or the other of the latter elements must also be present for the application of a provision or the relevance of a comment referring to longterm contracts depends on the rationale for that provision or comment for instance comment 2 on article 513 presupposes an ongoing relationship between the parties and a transaction involving performance of a complex nature depending on the context examples of longterm contracts may include contracts involving commercial agency distributorship out sourcing franchising leases eg equipment leases framework agreements investment or concession agreements contracts for professional services operation and maintenance agreements supply agreements eg raw materials constructioncivil works contracts industrial cooperation contractual jointventures etc provisions and comments of the principles that explicitly refer to longterm contracts are the preamble comment 2 article 111 and comment 3 article 2114 comments 1 3 and 4 article 2115 comment 3 article 43 comments 3 and 4 article 48 comments 1 2 and 3 article 513 comment 2 article 514 comment 3 article 518 and comment 2 article 622 comment 5 article 717 comment 5 article 735 comment 4 article 736 comment 1 article 737 and comment 1 several other provisions and comments are also particularly relevant in the context of longterm contracts see articles 17 18 211 comment 2 212 comments 1 and 2 216 2113 to 2118 331 332 512 517 comment 3 518 531 comment 5 534 611 614 615 6111 6114 to 6117 621 to 623 713 to 717 735 4 obligor obligee where necessary to better identify the party performing and the party receiving performance of obligations the terms obligor and obligee are used irrespective of whether the obligation is non monetary or monetary 5 writing in some cases the principles refer to a writing or a contract in writing see articles 2112 2117 and 2118 the principles define this formal requirement in functional terms thus a writing includes not only a telegram and a telex but also any other mode of communication including electronic communications that preserves a record and can be reproduced in tangible form this formal requirement should be compared with the more flexible form of a notice see article 1101 art 112 unidroit principles 32 article 112 computation of time set by parties 1 official holidays or nonbusiness days occurring during a period set by parties for an act to be performed are included in calculating the period 2 however if the last day of the period is an official holiday or a nonbusiness day at the place of business of the party to perform the act the period is extended until the first business day which follows unless the circumstances indicate otherwise 3 the relevant time zone is that of the place of business of the party setting the time unless the circumstances indicate otherwise comment the parties may either unilaterally or by agreement fix a period of time within which certain acts must be done see eg articles 217 2292 and 103 in fixing the time limit the parties may either indicate merely a period of time eg notice of defects in the goods must be given within ten days after delivery or a precise date eg offer firm until 1 march in the first case the question arises of whether or not holidays or non business days occurring during the period of time are included in calculating the period of time and according to paragraph 1 of this article the answer is in the affirmative in both of the abovementioned cases the question may arise of what the effect would be of a holiday or nonbusiness day falling at the expiry of the fixed period of time at the place of business of the party to perform the act paragraph 2 provides that in such an eventuality the period is extended until the first business day that follows unless the circumstances indicate otherwise general provisions art 112 33 finally whenever the parties are situated in different time zones the question arises as to what time zone is relevant and according to paragraph 3 it is the time zone of the place of business of the party setting the time limit unless the circumstances indicate otherwise i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a sales contract provides that buyer a must give notice of defects of the goods within 10 days after delivery the goods are delivered on friday 16 december a gives notice of defects on monday 2 january and seller b rejects it as being untimely a may not object that the holidays and nonbusiness days which occurred between 16 december and 2 january should not be counted when calculating the ten days of the time limit 2 offeror a indicates that its offer is firm until 1 march offeree b accepts the offer on 2 march because 1 march was a holiday at its place of business a may not object that the fixed time limit for acceptance had expired on 1 march 3 offeror a sends an offer to offeree b by email on a saturday indicating that the offer is firm for 24 hours if b intends to accept it must do so within 24 hours even though the time limit elapses on a sunday since under the circumstances the time limit fixed by a was to be understood as absolute 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 except that a is situated in frankfurt and b in new york and the time limit fixed for acceptance is by 5 pm tomorrow at the latest b must accept by 5 pm frankfurt time 5 a charterparty concluded between owner a situated in tokyo and charterer b situated in kuwait city provides for payment of the freight by b at as bank in zurich switzerland on a specific date by 5 pm at latest the relevant time zone is neither that of a nor that of b but that of zurich where payment is due 34 chapter 2 formation and authority of agents section 1 formation article 211 manner of formation a contract may be concluded either by the acceptance of an offer or by conduct of the parties that is sufficient to show agreement comment 1 offer and acceptance basic to the principles is the idea that the agreement of the parties is in itself sufficient to conclude a contract see article 312 the concepts of offer and acceptance have traditionally been used to determine whether and if so when the parties have reached agreement as this article and this chapter make clear the principles retain these concepts as essential tools of analysis 2 conduct sufficient to show agreement in commercial practice contracts particularly when related to complex transactions are often concluded after prolonged negotiations without an identifiable sequence of offer and acceptance in such cases it may be difficult to determine if and when a contractual agreement has been reached according to this article a contract may be held to be concluded even though the moment of its formation cannot be determined provided that the conduct of the parties is sufficient to show agreement in order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of the parties intention to be bound by a contract their conduct has to be interpreted in accordance with the criteria set forth in article 41 et seq formation art 212 35 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a and b enter into negotiations with a view to setting up a joint venture for the development of a new product after prolonged negotiations without any formal offer or acceptance and with some minor points still to be settled both parties begin to perform when subsequently the parties fail to reach an agreement on these minor points a court or arbitral tribunal may decide that a contract was nevertheless concluded since the parties had begun to perform thereby showing their intention to be bound by a contract 3 automated contracting the language of this article is sufficiently broad to cover also cases of socalled automated contracting ie where the parties agree to use a system capable of setting in motion selfexecuting electronic actions leading to the conclusion of a contract without the intervention of a natural person i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 automobile manufacturer a and components supplier b set up an electronic data interchange system which as soon as as stocks of components fall below a certain level automatically generates orders for the components and executes such orders the fact that a and b have agreed on the operation of such a system makes the orders and performances binding on a and b even though they have been generated without the personal intervention of a and b article 212 definition of offer a proposal for concluding a contract constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance comment in defining an offer as distinguished from other communications which a party may make in the course of negotiations initiated with a view to concluding a contract this article lays down two requirements the proposal must i be sufficiently definite to permit the conclusion of the contract by mere acceptance and ii indicate the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance art 212 unidroit principles 36 1 definiteness of an offer since a contract is concluded by the mere acceptance of an offer the terms of the future agreement must already be indicated with sufficient definiteness in the offer itself whether a given offer meets this requirement cannot be established in general terms even essential terms such as the precise description of the goods or the services to be delivered or rendered the price to be paid for them the time or place of performance etc may be left undetermined in the offer without necessarily rendering it insufficiently definite all depends on whether or not the offeror by making the offer and the offeree by accepting it intend to enter into a binding agreement and whether or not the missing terms can be determined by interpreting the language of the agreement in accordance with articles 41 et seq or supplied in accordance with articles 48 or 512 indefiniteness may moreover be overcome by reference to practices established between the parties or to usages see article 19 as well as by reference to specific provisions to be found elsewhere in the principles eg articles 516 determination of quality of performance 517 price determination 611 time of performance 616 place of performance and 6110 currency not expressed i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a has for a number of years annually renewed a contract with b for technical assistance for as computers a opens a second office with the same type of computers and asks b to provide assistance also for the new computers b accepts and despite the fact that as offer does not specify all the terms of the agreement a contract has been concluded since the missing terms can be taken from the previous contracts as constituting a practice established between the parties 2 intention to be bound the second criterion for determining whether a party makes an offer for the conclusion of a contract or merely opens negotiations is that partys intention to be bound in the event of acceptance since such an intention will rarely be declared expressly it often has to be inferred from the circumstances of each individual case the way in which the proponent presents the proposal eg by expressly defining it as an formation art 213 37 offer or as a mere declaration of intent provides a first although not a decisive indication of possible intention of even greater importance are the content and the addressees of the proposal generally speaking the more detailed and definite the proposal the more likely it is to be construed as an offer a proposal addressed to one or more specific persons is more likely to be intended as an offer than is one made to the public at large i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 after lengthy negotiations the executive directors of two companies a and b lay down the conditions on which b will acquire 51 of the shares in company c which is totally owned by a the memorandum of agreement signed by the negotiators contains a final clause stating that the agreement is not binding until approved by as board of directors there is no contract before such approval is given by them 3 a a government agency advertises for bids for the setting up of a new telephone network such an advertisement is merely an invitation to submit offers which may or may not be accepted by a if however the advertisement indicates in detail the technical specifications of the project and states that the contract will be awarded to the lowest bid conforming to the specifications it may amount to an offer with the consequence that the contract will be concluded once the lowest bid has been identified a proposal may contain all the essential terms of the contract but nevertheless not bind the proponent in case of acceptance if it makes the conclusion of the contract dependent on the reaching of agreement on some minor points left open in the proposal see article 2113 article 213 withdrawal of offer 1 an offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree 2 an offer even if it is irrevocable may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer art 214 unidroit principles 38 comment 1 when an offer becomes effective paragraph 1 of this article which is taken literally from article 15 cisg provides that an offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree see article 1102 for the definition of reaches see article 1103 the time at which the offer becomes effective is of importance as it indicates the precise moment as from which the offeree can accept it thus definitely binding the offeror to the proposed contract 2 withdrawal of an offer there is however a further reason why it may in practice be important to determine the moment at which the offer becomes effective indeed up to that time the offeror is free to change its mind and to decide not to enter into the agreement at all or to replace the original offer by a new one irrespective of whether or not the original offer was intended to be irrevocable the only condition is that the offeree is informed of the offerors altered intentions before or at the same time as the offeree is informed of the original offer by expressly stating this paragraph 2 of this article makes it clear that a distinction is to be drawn between withdrawal and revocation of an offer before an offer becomes effective it can always be withdrawn whereas the question of whether or not it may be revoked see article 214 arises only after that moment article 214 revocation of offer 1 until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree before it has dispatched an acceptance 2 however an offer cannot be revoked a if it indicates whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise that it is irrevocable or b if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer formation art 214 39 comment the problem of whether an offer is or is not revocable is traditionally one of the most controversial issues in the context of the formation of contracts since there is no prospect of reconciling the two basic approaches followed in this respect by the different legal systems ie the common law approach according to which an offer is as a rule revocable and the opposite approach followed by the majority of civil law systems the only remaining possibility is that of selecting one approach as the main rule and the other as the exception 1 offers as a rule revocable paragraph 1 of this article which is taken literally from article 16 cisg states that until the contract is concluded offers are as a rule revocable the same paragraph however subjects the revocation of an offer to the condition that it reach the offeree before the offeree has dispatched an acceptance it is thus only when the offeree orally accepts the offer or when the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act without giving notice to the offeror see article 2163 that the offerors right to revoke the offer continues to exist until such time as the contract is concluded where however the offer is accepted by a written indication of assent so that the contract is concluded when the acceptance reaches the offeror see article 2162 the offerors right to revoke the offer terminates earlier ie when the offeree dispatches the acceptance such a solution may cause some inconvenience to the offeror who will not always know whether or not it is still possible to revoke the offer it is however justified in view of the legitimate interest of the offeree in the time available for revocation being shortened as to the determination of the time of dispatch see article 218 and the comment thereto 2 irrevocable offers paragraph 2 provides for two important exceptions to the general rule as to the revocability of offers i where the offer contains an indication that it is irrevocable and ii where the offeree having other good reasons to treat the offer as being irrevocable has acted in reliance on that offer a indication of irrevocability contained in the offer the indication that the offer is irrevocable may be made in different ways the most direct and clear of which is an express statement to that art 214 unidroit principles 40 effect by the offeror eg this is a firm offer we shall stand by our offer until we receive your answer it may however simply be inferred from other statements by or conduct of the offeror the indication of a fixed time for acceptance may but need not necessarily amount by itself to an implicit indication of an irrevocable offer the answer must be found in each case through a proper interpretation of the terms of the offer in accordance with the various criteria laid down in the general rules on interpretation in chapter 4 in general if the offeror operates within a legal system where the fixing of a time for acceptance is considered to indicate irrevocability it may be assumed that by specifying such a fixed time the offeror intends to make an irrevocable offer if on the other hand the offeror operates in a legal system where the fixing of a time for acceptance is not sufficient to indicate irrevocability the offeror will not normally have had such an intention i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a travel agency informs a client of a cruise in its brochure for the coming new year holidays it urges the client to book within the next three days adding that after that date there will probably be no more places left this statement by itself will not be considered to indicate that the offer is irrevocable during the first three days 2 a invites b to submit a written offer of the terms on which b is prepared to construct a building b presents a detailed offer containing the statement price and other conditions are not good after 1 september if a and b operate within a legal system where such a statement is considered to be an indication that the offer is irrevocable until the specified date b can expect the offer to be understood as being irrevocable the same may not necessarily be the case if the offeree operates in a legal system where such a statement is not considered as being sufficient to indicate that the offer is irrevocable b reliance by offeree on irrevocability of offer the second exception to the general rule regarding the revocability of offers ie where it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer is an application of the general principle prohibiting formation art 215 41 inconsistent behaviour laid down in article 18 the reasonable reliance of the offeree may have been induced either by the conduct of the offeror or by the nature of the offer itself eg an offer whose acceptance requires extensive and costly investigation on the part of the offeree or an offer made with a view to permitting the offeree in turn to make an offer to a third party the acts which the offeree must have performed in reliance on the offer may consist in making preparations for production buying or hiring of materials or equipment incurring expenses etc provided that such acts could have been regarded as normal in the trade concerned or should otherwise have been foreseen by or known to the offeror i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 a an antique dealer asks b to restore ten paintings on condition that the work is completed within three months and that the price does not exceed a specific amount b informs a that so as to know whether or not to accept the offer b finds it necessary to begin work on one painting and will then give a definite answer within five days a agrees and b relying on as offer begins work immediately a may not revoke the offer during those five days 4 a seeks an offer from b for incorporation in a bid on a project to be assigned within a stated time b submits an offer on which a relies when calculating the price of the bid before the expiry of the date but after a has made the bid b informs a that it is no longer willing to stand by its offer bs offer is irrevocable until the stated date since in making its bid a relied on bs offer article 215 rejection of offer an offer is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror comment 1 rejection may be express or implied an offer may be rejected either expressly or impliedly a frequent case of implied rejection is a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but which contains additions limitations or other modi fications see article 21111 art 216 unidroit principles 42 in the absence of an express rejection the statements by or the conduct of the offeree must in any event be such as to justify the belief of the offeror that the offeree has no intention of accepting the offer a reply on the part of the offeree which merely asks whether there would be a possible alternative eg is there any chance of the price being reduced or could you deliver a couple of days earlier would not normally be sufficient to justify such a conclusion it should be recalled that a rejection will bring about the termination of any offer irrespective of whether it was revocable or irrevocable according to article 214 i l l u s t r a t i o n a receives an offer from b stating that the offer will be firm for two weeks a replies by return of post asking for partially different conditions which b does not accept a may no longer accept the original offer even though there are still several days left before the expiry of the two week period since by making a counteroffer a implicitly rejected the original offer 2 rejection only one cause of termination of an offer rejection by the offeree is only one of the causes of termination of an offer other causes are dealt with in articles 2141 and 217 article 216 mode of acceptance 1 a statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance 2 an acceptance of an offer becomes effective when the indication of assent reaches the offeror 3 however if by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act without notice to the offeror the acceptance is effective when the act is performed formation art 216 43 comment 1 indication of assent to an offer for there to be an acceptance the offeree must in one way or another indicate assent to the offer the mere acknowledgement of receipt of the offer or an expression of interest in it is not sufficient furthermore the assent must be unconditional ie it cannot be made dependent on some further step to be taken by either the offeror eg our acceptance is subject to your final approval or the offeree eg we hereby accept the terms of the contract as set forth in your memorandum and undertake to submit the contract to our board for approval within the next two weeks finally the purported acceptance must contain no variation of the terms of the offer or at least none which materially alters them see article 2111 2 acceptance by conduct provided that the offer does not impose any particular mode of acceptance the indication of assent may either be made by an express statement or be inferred from the conduct of the offeree paragraph 1 of this article does not specify the form such conduct should assume most often it will consist in acts of performance such as the payment of an advance on the price the shipment of goods or the beginning of work at the site etc 3 silence or inactivity by stating that silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance paragraph 1 makes it clear that as a rule mere silence or inactivity on the part of the offeree does not allow the inference that the offeree assents to the offer the situation is different if the parties themselves agree that silence shall amount to acceptance or if there exists a course of dealing or usage to that effect in no event however is it sufficient for the offeror to state unilaterally in its offer that the offer will be deemed to have been accepted in the absence of any reply from the offeree since it is the offeror who takes the initiative by proposing the conclusion of the contract the offeree is free not only to accept or not to accept the offer but also simply to ignore it i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a requests b to set out the conditions for the renewal of a contract for the supply of wine due to expire on 31 december in its offer b includes a provision stating that if we have not heard from you at the latest by the end of november we will assume that you art 216 unidroit principles 44 have agreed to renew the contract on the conditions indicated above a finds the proposed conditions totally unacceptable and does not even reply the former contract expires on the fixed date without a new contract having been agreed between the parties 2 under a longterm contract for the supply of wine b regularly met as orders without expressly confirming its acceptance on 15 november a orders a large stock for new year b does not reply nor does it deliver at the requested time b is in breach since in accordance with the practice established between the parties bs silence in regard to as order amounts to an acceptance 4 when acceptance becomes effective according to paragraph 2 an acceptance becomes effective at the moment the indication of assent reaches the offeror see article 1102 for the definition of reaches see article 1103 the reason for the adoption of the receipt principle in preference to the dispatch principle is that the risk of transmission is better placed on the offeree than on the offeror since it is the former who chooses the means of communication who knows whether the chosen means of communica tion is subject to special risks or delay and who is consequently best able to take measures to ensure that the acceptance reaches its destination as a rule an acceptance by means of mere conduct likewise becomes effective only when notice thereof reaches the offeror it should be noted however that special notice to this effect by the offeree will be necessary only in cases where the conduct will not of itself give notice of acceptance to the offeror within a reasonable period of time in all other cases eg where the conduct consists in the payment of the price or the shipment of the goods by air or by some other rapid mode of transportation the same effect may well be achieved simply by the bank or the carrier informing the offeror of the funds transfer or of the consignment of the goods an exception to the general rule of paragraph 2 is to be found in the cases envisaged in paragraph 3 ie where by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act without notice to the offeror in such cases the acceptance is effective at the moment the act is performed irrespective of whether or not the offeror is promptly informed thereof formation art 217 45 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 a asks b to write a special program for the setting up of a data bank without giving a notice of acceptance b begins to write the program and after its completion insists on payment in accordance with the terms set out in as offer b is not entitled to payment since bs purported acceptance of as offer never became effective as b never notified a of it 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 except that in the offer b is informed of as absence for the following two weeks and that if b intends to accept the offer b should begin writing the program immediately so as to save time the contract is concluded once b begins to perform even if b fails to inform a thereof either immediately or at a later stage this article corresponds to paragraphs 1 2 first part and 3 of article 18 cisg article 217 time of acceptance an offer must be accepted within the time the offeror has fixed or if no time is fixed within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror an oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise comment with respect to the time within which an offer must be accepted this article which corresponds to the second part of paragraph 2 of article 18 cisg distinguishes between written and oral offers as concerns written offers all depends upon whether or not the offer indicated a specific time for acceptance if it did the offer must be accepted within that time while in all other cases the indication of assent must reach the offeror within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror art 218 unidroit principles 46 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a sends b an offer on monday indicating that if b intends to accept it must do so by friday at the latest bs acceptance reaches a on the monday of the following week a may reject bs acceptance as being too late 2 a sends b an offer on monday morning by email urging b to reply as soon as possible although on previous occasions a and b had already communicated by email b accepts as offer by letter which reaches a on thursday bs acceptance is too late since under the circumstances an acceptance by a letter which reaches a three days after its email was not made as soon as possible oral offers must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise an offer is to be considered oral not only when made in the presence of the offeree but whenever the offeree can respond immediately this is the case of an offer made over the phone or communicated electronically in real time it is important to note that the rules laid down in this article also apply to situations where in accordance with article 2163 the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act without notice to the offeror in these cases it is the act of performance which has to be accomplished within the respective periods of time for the determination of the precise starting point of the period of time fixed by the offeror see article 218 as to the calculation of holidays falling within that period of time see article 112 as to cases of late acceptance and of delay in transmission see article 219 article 218 acceptance within a fixed period of time a period of acceptance fixed by the offeror begins to run from the time that the offer is dispatched a time indicated in the offer is deemed to be the time of dispatch unless the circumstances indicate otherwise comment whenever an offeror fixes a period of time for acceptance the question arises of when the period begins to run according to this article it begins to run from the moment the offer is dispatched ie formation art 219 47 has left the sphere of control of the offeror as to when this occurs there is a presumption that the time of dispatch is the time indicated in the offer for instance in the case of a letter the date of despatch will be the date shown on the letter in the case of an email it will be the time indicated as the sending time by the offerors server etc however the presumption may be rebutted if in a given case the circumstances indicate otherwise thus if the date shown on a fax letter is prior to the sending date printed by the fax machine the latter date should prevail likewise if the date shown on a letter is later than the delivery date of the letter it is clear that the latter was written in by mistake and should therefore be disregarded article 219 late acceptance delay in transmission 1 a late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without undue delay the offeror so informs the offeree or gives notice to that effect 2 if a communication containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless without undue delay the offeror informs the offeree that it considers the offer as having lapsed comment 1 late acceptance normally ineffective according to the principle laid down in article 217 for an acceptance to be effective it must reach the offeror within the time fixed by the latter or if no time is fixed within a reasonable time this means that as a rule an acceptance which reaches the offeror thereafter is without effect and may be disregarded by the offeror art 219 unidroit principles 48 2 offeror may nevertheless accept late acceptance paragraph 1 of this article which corresponds to article 21 cisg states that the offeror may nevertheless consider a late acceptance as having arrived in time and thus render it effective provided that the offeror without undue delay so informs the offeree or gives notice to that effect if the offeror takes advantage of this possibility the contract is to be considered as having been concluded as soon as the late acceptance reaches the offeror and not when the offeror informs the offeree of its intention to consider the late acceptance effective i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a indicates 31 march as the deadline for acceptance of its offer bs acceptance reaches a on 3 april a who is still interested in the contract intends to accept bs late acceptance and immediately informs b of its intention notwithstanding the fact that this notice only reaches b on 5 april the contract is concluded on 3 april 3 acceptance late because of delay in transmission as long as the acceptance is late because the offeree did not send it in time it is natural to consider it as having no effect unless the offeror expressly indicates otherwise the situation is different when the offeree has replied in time but the acceptance reaches the offeror late because of an unexpected delay in transmission in such a case the reliance of the offeree on the acceptance having arrived in time deserves protection with the consequence that the late acceptance is considered to be effective unless the offeror objects without undue delay the only condition required by paragraph 2 is that the communication containing the late acceptance show that it was sent in such circumstances that had its transmission been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b knowing that the normal time for transmission of letters by mail to a is three days sends its letter of acceptance on 25 march owing to a strike of the postal service in as country the letter which shows the date of its mailing on the envelope only arrives on 3 april bs acceptance though late is nevertheless effective unless a objects without undue delay formation art 2111 49 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b after receiving as offer accepts it on 30 march by email due to technical problems at as server the email reaches a only on 1 april bs acceptance though late is nevertheless effective unless a objects without undue delay article 2110 withdrawal of acceptance an acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective comment with respect to the withdrawal of an acceptance this article lays down the same principle as that contained in article 213 concerning the withdrawal of an offer ie that the offeree may change its mind and withdraw the acceptance provided that the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance it should be noted that while the offeror is bound by the offer and may no longer change its mind once the offeree has dispatched the acceptance see article 2141 the offeree looses its freedom of choice only at a later stage ie when the notice of acceptance reaches the offeror this article corresponds to article 22 cisg article 2111 modified acceptance 1 a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counteroffer art 2111 unidroit principles 50 2 however a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains addi tional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance unless the offeror without undue delay objects to the discrepancy if the offeror does not object the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance comment 1 acceptance with modifications normally to be considered a counteroffer in commercial dealings it often happens that the offeree while signifying to the offeror its intention to accept the offer acknowledgement of order nevertheless includes in its declaration terms additional to or different from those of the offer paragraph 1 of this article provides that such a purported acceptance is as a rule to be considered a rejection of the offer and that it amounts to a counteroffer by the offeree which the offeror may or may not accept either expressly or impliedly eg by an act of performance 2 modifications which do not alter the nature of the acceptance the principle according to which the acceptance must be the mirror image of the offer implies that even unimportant differences between the offer and the acceptance permit either party at a later stage to question the existence of the contract in order to avoid such a result which a party may well seek merely because market conditions have changed unfavourably paragraph 2 provides for an exception to the general rule laid down in paragraph 1 by stating that if the additional or modified terms contained in the acceptance do not materially alter the terms of the offer the contract is concluded with those modifications unless the offeror objects without undue delay what amounts to a material modification cannot be determined in the abstract but will depend on the circumstances of each case additional or different terms relating to the price or mode of payment place and time of performance of a nonmonetary obligation the extent of one partys liability to the other or the settlement of disputes will normally but need not necessarily constitute a material modification formation art 2112 51 of the offer an important factor to be taken into account in this respect is whether the additional or different terms are commonly used in the trade sector concerned and therefore do not come as a surprise to the offeror i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a orders a machine from b to be tested on as premises in its acknowledgement of order b declares that it accepts the terms of the offer but adds that it wishes to be present at the testing of the machine the additional term is not a material modification of the offer and will therefore become part of the contract unless a objects without undue delay 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that in its acknowledgement of order b adds an arbitration clause unless the circumstances indicate otherwise such a clause amounts to a material modification of the terms of the offer with the result that bs purported acceptance would constitute a counteroffer 3 a orders a stated quantity of wheat from b in its acknowledgement of order b adds an arbitration clause which is standard practice in the commodity sector concerned since a cannot be surprised by such a clause it is not a material modification of the terms of the offer and unless a objects without undue delay the arbitration clause becomes part of the contract article 2112 writings in confirmation if a writing which is sent within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract and which purports to be a confirmation of the contract contains additional or different terms such terms become part of the contract unless they materially alter the contract or the recipient without undue delay objects to the discrepancy comment 1 writings in confirmation this article deals with the situation where a contract has already been concluded either orally or by the exchange of written communications limited to the essential terms of the agreement and art 2112 unidroit principles 52 one party subsequently sends the other a document intended simply to confirm what has already been agreed upon but which in fact contains terms which are additional to or different from those previously agreed by the parties in theory this situation clearly differs from that envisaged in article 2111 where a contract has not yet been concluded and the modifying terms are contained in the offerees purported acceptance yet since in practice it may be very difficult if not impossible to distinguish between the two situations this article adopts with respect to modifying terms contained in a writing in confirmation the same solution as that envisaged in article 2111 in other words just as for the modifications contained in an acknowledgement of order it is provided that terms additional to or different from those previously agreed by the parties contained in a writing in confirmation become part of the contract provided that they do not materially alter the agreement and that the recipient of the document does not object to them without undue delay it goes without saying that also in the context of writings in confirmation the question of which of the new terms materially alter the terms of the previous agreement can be answered definitely only in the light of the circumstances of each individual case on the other hand this article clearly does not apply to cases where the party sending the writing in confirmation expressly invites the other party to return it duly countersigned for acceptance in such circumstances it is irrelevant whether the writing contains modifications and if so whether or not these modifications are material since the writing must in any case be expressly accepted by the addressee if there is to be a contract i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a orders by telephone a machine from b who accepts the order the following day a receives a letter from b confirming the terms of their oral agreement but adding that b wishes to be present at the testing of the machine on as premises the additional term is not a material modification of the terms previously agreed between the parties and will therefore become part of the contract unless a objects without undue delay 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the modification contained in bs writing in confirmation consists in the addition of an arbitration clause unless the circumstances indicate otherwise such a clause amounts to a material modification of the terms previously agreed between the parties with the result that it will not become part of the contract formation art 2113 53 3 a orders by email a stated quantity of wheat and b accepts immediately by email later on the same day b sends a letter to a confirming the terms of their agreement but adding an arbitration clause which is standard practice in the commodity sector concerned since a cannot be surprised by such a clause it is not a material modification of the terms previously agreed and unless a objects without undue delay the arbitration clause becomes part of the contract 2 writing in confirmation to be sent within a reasonable time after conclusion of the contract the rule according to which silence on the part of the recipient amounts to acceptance of the content of the writing in confirmation including any nonmaterial modifications of the terms previously agreed presupposes that the writing is sent within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract any writing of this kind sent after a period of time which in the circumstances appears to be unreasonably long loses any significance and silence on the part of the recipient may therefore no longer be interpreted as acceptance of its content 3 invoices for the purposes of this article the term writing in confirmation is to be understood in a broad sense ie as covering also those cases where a party uses the invoice or another similar document relating to performance to specify the conditions of the contract concluded either orally or by informal correspondence provided that such use is customary in the trade sector andor country concerned article 2113 conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on specific matters or in a particular form where in the course of negotiations one of the parties insists that the contract is not concluded until there is agreement on specific matters or in a particular form no contract is concluded before agreement is reached on those matters or in that form art 2113 unidroit principles 54 comment 1 conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on specific matters as a rule a contract is concluded if the parties reach agreement on the terms which are essential to the type of transaction involved while minor terms which the parties have not settled may subsequently be implied either in fact or by law see comment 1 on article 212 and also articles 48 and 512 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a agrees with b on all the terms which are essential to their intended contract for the distribution of as goods when the question subsequently arises of who should bear the costs of the publicity campaign neither party may claim that no contract has come into existence by reason of the silence of the contract on this point as the missing term is not essential to the type of transaction in question and will be implied in fact or by law parties may however in a given case consider specific matters to be of such importance that they do not intend to enter into a binding agreement unless these matters are settled in a satisfactory manner if the parties or one only of them make such an intention explicit the contract as such does not come into existence without agreement on those matters by using the word insists this article makes it clear that it is not sufficient for the parties to manifest their intention to this effect simply in passing but that it must be done unequivocally i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that during the negotiations b repeatedly declares that the question of who should bear the cost of the publicity campaign must be settled expressly notwithstanding their agreement on all the essential terms of the contract no contract has come into existence between a and b since b had insisted that the conclusion of the contract was dependent on agreement regarding that specific term 2 conclusion of contract dependent on agreement in a particular form in commercial practice particularly when transactions of considerable complexity are involved it is quite frequent that after prolonged negotiations the parties sign an informal document called formation art 2114 55 preliminary agreement memorandum of understanding letter of intent or the like containing the terms of the agreement so far reached but at the same time state their intention to provide for the execution of a formal document at a later stage subject to contract formal agreement to follow in some cases the parties consider their contract as already being concluded and the execution of the formal document only as confirmation of the already complete agreement if however both parties or only one of them make it clear that they do not intend to be bound unless the formal document has been drawn up there will be no contract until that time even if the parties have agreed on all the relevant aspects of their transaction i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 after prolonged negotiations a and b sign a memorandum of understanding containing the terms of an agreement for a joint venture for the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf of country x the parties agree that they will at a later stage draw up the agreement in formal documents to be signed and exchanged at a public ceremony if the memorandum already contains all the relevant terms of the agreement and the subsequent documents are intended merely to permit the agreement to be properly presented to the public it may be taken that the contract was already concluded when the first written document was signed 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 except that the memorandum of understanding contains a clause such as not binding until final agreement is executed or the like until the signing and the exchange of the formal documents there is no binding contract article 2114 contract with terms deliberately left open 1 if the parties intend to conclude a contract the fact that they intentionally leave a term to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the parties or by a third person does not prevent a contract from coming into existence 2 the existence of the contract is not affected by the fact that subsequently a the parties reach no agreement on the term art 2114 unidroit principles 56 b the party who is to determine the term does not do so or c the third person does not determine the term provided that there is an alternative means of rendering the term definite that is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the intention of the parties comment 1 contract with terms deliberately left open a contract may be silent on one or more issues because the parties simply did not think of them during the negotiations provided that the parties have agreed on the terms essential to the type of transaction concerned a contract will nonetheless have been concluded and the missing terms will be supplied on the basis of articles 48 or 512 see comment 1 on article 212 quite different is the case dealt with in this article here the parties intentionally leave open one or more terms because they are unable or unwilling to determine them at the time of the conclusion of the contract and refer for their determination to an agreement to be made by them at a later stage or to a determination to be made by one of them or by a third person this latter situation which is especially frequent in although not confined to longterm contracts gives rise in essence to two problems first whether the fact that the parties have intentionally left terms open prevents a contract from coming into existence and second if this is not the case what will happen to the contract if the parties subsequently fail to reach agreement or if the party or third person who is to make the determination does not do so 2 open terms not in themselves an impediment to valid conclusion of contract paragraph 1 states that if the parties intended to conclude a contract the fact that they have intentionally left a term to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the parties or by a third person does not prevent a contract from coming into existence formation art 2114 57 in cases where it is not expressly stated the parties intention to conclude a contract notwithstanding the terms left open may be inferred from other circumstances such as the nonessential character of the terms in question the degree of definiteness of the agreement as a whole the fact that the open terms relate to items which by their very nature can be determined only at a later stage the fact that the agreement has already been partially executed etc i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a shipping line enters into a detailed agreement with b a terminal operator for the use of bs container terminal the agreement fixes the minimum volume of containers to be discharged or loaded annually and the fees payable while the fees for additional containers are left to be determined if and when the minimum volume is reached two months later a learns that bs competitor would offer better conditions and refuses to perform claiming that the agreement with b never resulted in a binding contract because the question of the fees had not been settled a is liable for non performance because the detailed character of the agreement as well as the fact that both a and b began performance immediately indicate clearly that their intention was to enter into a binding agreement 3 failure of mechanism provided for by parties for determination of open terms if the parties are unable to reach agreement on the open terms or if the party or the third person who is to make the determination does not do so the question arises as to whether or not the contract comes to an end according to paragraph 2 of this article the existence of the contract is not affected provided that there is an alternative means of rendering the term definite that is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the intention of the parties the alternative means of supplying the missing term will generally be application of the gapfilling provisions in section 1 of chapter 5 and section 1 of chapter 6 for example by determining the price under article 5171 or by fixing the time for performance under article 611 where those provisions can appropriately supply the relevant term there may be situations particularly in respect of longterm contracts where those provisions may not be appropriate even where they cover the subjectmatter of the missing term in such situations the term will be supplied by article 48 or article 512 art 2114 unidroit principles 58 where the parties have deferred the determination of the missing term to a third person to be nominated by a named institution or person such as the president of a tribunal or a chamber of commerce etc if the nominated third person does not determine the term a new third person may be nominated the cases in which it will be necessaryxa0toxa0 nominate a new third person are likely to be quite rare in practice few problems should arise as long as the term to be implemented is of minor importance if on the other hand the term in question is essential to the type of transaction concerned there must be clear evidence of the intention of the parties to uphold the contract among the factors to be taken into account in this connection are whether the term in question relates to items which by their very nature can be determined only at a later stage whether the agreement has already been partially executed etc i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that when the minimum volume of containers to be loaded or unloaded is reached the parties fail to agree on the fees payable in respect of the additional containers a stops performing claiming that the contract has come to an end a is liable for nonperformance since the fact that the parties have started performing without making future agreement on the missing term a condition for the continuation of their business relationship is sufficient evidence of their intention to uphold the contract even in the absence of such agreement the fees for the additional containers will then generally be determined according to the criteria laid down in article 517 4 open terms in longterm contracts as stated above and particularly in the case of longterm contracts the parties may leave a term to be agreed when that term applies only to obligations at a later stage of the contract for example the parties may agree a price which is only to apply during the first year of the contract leaving open the price to apply for the second or subsequent years equally the parties may leave open the date for delivery because for instance the delivery of a piece of machinery may depend on the completion of a building before it is delivered in such circumstances the term as to price may not be appropriately supplied by reference to article 517 nor may time of performance be appropriately supplied by reference to article 611 the appropriate term would then be supplied by article 48 or article 512 formation art 2115 59 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the fees payable in respect of the additional containers are fixed for the first year but there is no provision as to the fees to be charged for the second or subsequent years in such a case it may not be appropriate to determine the fees in accordance with article 517 by reference to a price at the time of the conclusion of the contract instead it may be appropriate to fix a fee by reference to the date at the end of the first year a term to that effect could be supplied under article 48 or article 512 4 x is a power company and has decided to construct a new power station x is purchasing a generator from y the generator will be installed directly onto the foundations in the generator building at the power station after that building has been completed a generator can be delivered no earlier than 3 years after it is ordered x has not yet entered into a construction contract for the power station but the generator building will only take 6 months to complete once the construction contract starts x places a contract now for the generator so that it will be ready in time but cannot yet fix a time for delivery the parties leave the date of delivery as to be agreed if they do not agree a date for delivery it may not be appropriate to determine the time for delivery as being within a reasonable time after conclusion of the contract between x and y in accordance with the provisions of article 611 it may be appropriate to fix a term by reference to the completion of the generator building a term to that effect could be supplied under article 48 or article 512 article 2115 negotiations in bad faith 1 a party is free to negotiate and is not liable for failure to reach an agreement 2 however a party who negotiates or breaks off negotiations in bad faith is liable for the losses caused to the other party art 2115 unidroit principles 60 3 it is bad faith in particular for a party to enter into or continue negotiations when intending not to reach an agreement with the other party comment 1 freedom of negotiation as a rule parties are not only free to decide when and with whom to enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a contract but also if how and for how long to proceed with their efforts to reach an agreement this follows from the basic principle of freedom of contract enunciated in article 11 and is essential in order to guarantee healthy competition among business people engaged in international trade 2 liability for negotiating in bad faith a partys right freely to enter into negotiations and to decide on the terms to be negotiated is however not unlimited and must not conflict with the principle of good faith and fair dealing laid down in article 17 one particular instance of negotiating in bad faith which is expressly indicated in paragraph 3 of this article is that where a party enters into negotiations or continues to negotiate without any intention of concluding an agreement with the other party other instances are where one party has deliberately or by negligence misled the other party as to the nature or terms of the proposed contract either by actually misrepresenting facts or by not disclosing facts which given the nature of the parties andor the contract should have been disclosed as to the duty of confidentiality see article 2116 a partys liability for negotiating in bad faith is limited to the losses caused to the other party paragraph 2 in other words the aggrieved party may recover the expenses incurred in the negotiations and may also be compensated for the lost opportunity to conclude another contract with a third person socalled reliance or negative interest but may generally not recover the profit which would have resulted had the original contract been concluded socalled expectation or positive interest formation art 2115 61 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a learns of bs intention to sell its restaurant a who has no intention whatsoever of buying the restaurant nevertheless enters into lengthy negotiations with b for the sole purpose of preventing b from selling the restaurant to c a competitor of as a who breaks off negotiations when c has bought another restaurant is liable to b for bs losses these losses may include the difference in price and whatever other losses may be established 2 a who is negotiating with b for the promotion of the purchase of military equipment by the armed forces of bs country learns that b will not receive the necessary import licence from its own governmental authorities a prerequisite for permission to pay bs fees a does not reveal this fact to b and finally concludes the contract which however cannot be enforced by reason of the missing licence a is liable to b for the costs incurred after a had learned of the impossibility of obtaining the required licence 3 a enters into lengthy negotiations for a bank loan from bs branch office at the last minute the branch office discloses that it had no authority to sign and that its head office has decided not to approve the draft agreement a who could in the meantime have obtained the loan from another bank is entitled to recover the expenses entailed by the negotiations and the profits it would have made during the delay before obtaining the loan from the other bank 3 agreement to negotiate in good faith by contrast if the parties have specifically agreed on a duty to negotiate in good faith all appropriate remedies for nonperformance will be available including the right to performance such as by directing the parties to negotiate and other remedies reflecting the expectation or positive interest to the extent that the requirements for such remedies can be demonstrated an agreedupon duty to negotiate in good faith means at the least a duty to negotiate or renegotiate seriously with an intent to conclude an agreement but not that an agreement must be reached of course this duty does not displace other duties under the principles eg articles 18 and 2116 in the case of a complex longterm contract parties who agree on a duty to negotiate in good faith may wish to define further that duty in light of the nature of the contract and its commercial context for example they may set standards of confidentiality agree on a timetable for the negotiation etc art 2115 unidroit principles 62 i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 contractor a and supplier b enter into a prebid agreement whereby they undertake to negotiate in good faith for the supply of equipment in the event that a succeeds in becoming prime contractor for a major construction project a is awarded the construction contract but after preliminary contacts with b refuses to continue the negotiations b may request enforcement of the duty to negotiate in good faith 4 liability for breaking off negotiations in bad faith the right to break off negotiations also is subject to the principle of good faith and fair dealing once an offer has been made it may be revoked only within the limits provided for in article 214 yet even before this stage is reached or in a negotiation process with no ascertainable sequence of offer and acceptance a party may no longer be free to break off negotiations abruptly and without justification when such a point of no return is reached depends on the circumstances of the case in particular the extent to which the other party as a result of the conduct of the first party had reason to rely on the positive outcome of the negotiations and on the number of issues relating to the future contract on which the parties have already reached agreement i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a assures b of the grant of a franchise if b takes steps to gain experience and is prepared to invest usd 300000 during the next two years b makes extensive preparations with a view to concluding the contract always with as assurance that b will be granted the franchise when all is ready for the signing of the agreement a informs b that the latter must invest a substantially higher sum b who refuses is entitled to recover from a the expenses incurred with a view to the conclusion of the contract formation art 2116 63 article 2116 duty of confidentiality where information is given as confidential by one party in the course of negotiations the other party is under a duty not to disclose that information or to use it improperly for its own purposes whether or not a contract is subsequently concluded where appropriate the remedy for breach of that duty may include compensation based on the benefit received by the other party comment 1 parties in general not under a duty of confidentiality just as there exists no general duty of disclosure so parties when entering into negotiations for the conclusion of a contract are normally under no obligation to treat the information they have exchanged as confidential in other words since a party is normally free to decide which facts relevant to the transaction under negotiation to disclose such information is as a rule to be considered nonconfidential ie information which the other party may either disclose to third persons or use for purposes of its own should no contract be concluded i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a invites b and c producers of airconditioning systems to submit offers for the installation of such a system in their offers b and c also provide some technical details regarding the functioning of their respective systems with a view to enhancing the merits of their products a decides to reject bs offer and to continue negotiations only with c a is free to use the information contained in bs offer in order to induce c to propose more favourable conditions 2 confidential information a party may have an interest in certain information given to the other party not being divulged or used for purposes other than those for which it was given as long as that party expressly declares that such information is to be considered confidential the situation is clear art 2116 unidroit principles 64 for by receiving the information the other party implicitly agrees to treat it as confidential the only problem which may arise is that if the period during which the other party is not to disclose the information is too long this might contravene the applicable laws prohibiting restrictive trade practices yet even in the absence of such an express declaration the receiving party may be under a duty of confidentiality this is the case where in view of the particular nature of the information or the professional qualifications of the parties it would be contrary to the general principle of good faith and fair dealing for the receiving party to disclose it or to use it for its own purposes after the breaking off of negotiations i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that in its offer b expressly requests a not to divulge certain technical specifications contained therein a may not use this information in its negotiations with c 3 a is interested in entering into a joint venture agreement with b or c the two leading car manufacturers in country x negotiations progress with b in particular and a receives fairly detailed information relating to bs plans for a new car design although b does not expressly request a to treat this information as confidential because it is for a new car design a may be under a duty not to disclose it to c nor is a allowed to use those plans for its own production process should the negotiations not result in the conclusion of a contract 3 damages recoverable the breach of confidentiality implies first liability in damages the amount of damages recoverable may vary depending on whether or not the parties entered into a special agreement for the nondisclosure of the information even if the injured party has not suffered any loss it may be entitled to recover from the nonperforming party the benefit the latter received by disclosing the information to third persons or by using it for its own purposes if necessary for example when the information has not yet been disclosed or has been disclosed only partially the injured party may also seek an injunction in accordance with the applicable law formation art 2118 65 article 2117 merger clauses a contract in writing which contains a clause indicating that the writing completely embodies the terms on which the parties have agreed cannot be contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior statements or agreements however such statements or agreements may be used to interpret the writing comment if the conclusion of a contract is preceded by more or less extended negotiations the parties may wish to put their agreement in writing and declare that document to constitute their final agreement this can be achieved by an appropriately drafted merger or integration clause eg this contract contains the entire agreement between the parties however the effect of such a clause is not to deprive prior statements or agreements of any relevance they may still be used as a means of interpreting the written document see also article 43a a merger clause of course covers only prior statements or agreements between the parties and does not preclude subsequent informal agreements between them the parties are however free to extend an agreed form even to future amendments see article 2118 this article indirectly confirms the principle set out in article 12 in the sense that in the absence of a merger clause extrinsic evidence supplementing or contradicting a written contract is admissible article 2118 modification in a particular form a contract in writing which contains a clause requiring any modification or termination by agreement to be in a particular form may not be otherwise modified or terminated however a party may be precluded by its conduct from asserting such a clause to the extent that the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on that conduct art 2118 unidroit principles 66 comment parties concluding a written contract may wish to ensure that any modification or termination by agreement will also be in writing or otherwise in a particular form and to this end include a special clause in the contract eg any modification of this contract may be made only by a writing signed by both parties alterations to the aboveindicated timeschedule must be confirmed in writing by the engineers representative on site this article states that as a rule such a clause renders ineffective any modification or termination by agreement not in the particular form required i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 contractor a contracts with purchaser b for the construction of a building the contract provides that any modification to the work schedule must be in writing and the document must be signed by both parties in the course of construction a sends b an email asking b to agree to the extension of a particular deadline b accepts by return of email the modification is ineffective since there is no single document bearing both parties signature yet there is an exception to the general rule in application of the general principle prohibiting inconsistent behaviour see article 18 this article specifies that a party may be precluded by its conduct from invoking the clause requiring any modification or termination to be in a particular form to the extent that the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on that conduct i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a a contractor contracts with b a school board for the construction of a new school building the contract provides that the second floor of the building is to have sufficient bearing capacity to support the school library notwithstanding a no oral modification clause in the same contract the parties orally agree that the second floor of the building should be of nonbearing construction a completes construction according to the modification and b who has observed the progress of the construction without making any objections only at this point objects to how the second floor has been constructed a court may decide that b is not entitled to invoke the no oral modification clause as a reasonably relied on the oral modification and is therefore not liable for nonperformance formation art 2119 67 article 2119 contracting under standard terms 1 where one party or both parties use standard terms in concluding a contract the general rules on formation apply subject to articles 2120 2122 2 standard terms are provisions which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party and which are actually used without negotiation with the other party comment 1 contracting under standard terms this article is the first of four articles articles 2119 2122 which deal with the special situation where one or both parties use standard terms in concluding a contract 2 notion of standard terms standard terms are to be understood as those contract provisions which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party and which are actually used without negotiation with the other party paragraph 2 what is decisive is not their formal presentation eg whether they are contained in a separate document or in the contract document itself whether they have been issued on preprinted forms or are only contained in an electronic file etc nor who prepared them the party itself a trade or professional association etc nor their volume whether they consist of a comprehensive set of provisions covering almost all the relevant aspects of the contract or of only one or two provisions regarding for instance exclusion of liability and arbitration what is decisive is the fact that they are drafted in advance for general and repeated use and that they are actually used in a given case by one of the parties without negotiation with the other party this latter requirement obviously relates only to the standard terms as such which the other party must accept as a whole while the other terms of the same contract may well be the subject of negotiation between the parties art 2119 unidroit principles 68 3 general rules on formation apply usually the general rules on formation apply irrespective of whether or not one or both parties use standard terms paragraph 1 it follows that standard terms proposed by one party bind the other party only on acceptance and that it depends upon the circumstances of the case whether the two parties must refer to the standard terms expressly or whether the incorporation of such terms may be implied thus standard terms contained in the contract document itself will normally be binding upon the mere signature of the contract document as a whole at least as long as they are reproduced above that signature and not for instance on the reverse side of the document on the other hand standard terms contained in a separate document or electronic file will normally have to be referred to expressly by the party intending to use them implied incorporation may be admitted only if there exists a practice established between the parties or usage to that effect see article 19 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a intends to conclude an insurance contract with b covering the risk of liability for accidents of as employees at work the parties sign a model contract form presented by b after filling in the blank spaces relating among other matters to the premium and to the maximum amount insured by virtue of its signature a is bound not only by the terms which it has individually negotiated with b but also by the general conditions of the national insurers association which are printed on the form 2 a normally concludes contracts with its customers on the basis of its own standard terms which are printed as a separate document when making an offer to b a new customer a fails to make an express reference to the standard terms b accepts the offer the standard terms are not incorporated in the contract unless a can prove that b knew or ought to have known of as intention to conclude the contract only on the basis of its own standard terms eg because the same standard terms had regularly been adopted in previous transactions 3 a intends to buy grain on the commodity exchange in london in the contract concluded between a and b a broker on that exchange no express reference is made to the standard terms which normally govern brokerage contracts concluded at the exchange in question the standard terms are nevertheless incorporated in the contract because their application to the kind of contract in question amounts to a usage formation art 2120 69 article 2120 surprising terms 1 no term contained in standard terms which is of such a character that the other party could not reasonably have expected it is effective unless it has been expressly accepted by that party 2 in determining whether a term is of such a character regard shall be had to its content language and presentation comment 1 surprising terms in standard terms not effective a party which accepts the other partys standard terms is in principle bound by them irrespective of whether or not it actually knows their content in detail or fully understands their implications an important exception to this rule is however laid down in this article which states that notwithstanding its acceptance of the standard terms as a whole the adhering party is not bound by those terms which by virtue of their content language or presentation are of such a character that it could not reasonably have expected them the reason for this exception is the desire to avoid a party which uses standard terms taking undue advantage of its position by surreptitiously attempting to impose terms on the other party which that party would scarcely have accepted had it been aware of them for other articles intended to protect the economically weaker or less experienced party see articles 327 and 46 2 terms surprising by virtue of their content a particular term contained in standard terms may come as a surprise to the adhering party first by reason of its content this is the case whenever the content of the term in question is such that a reasonable person of the same kind as the adhering party would not have expected it in the type of standard terms involved in determining whether or not a term is unusual regard must be had on the one hand to the terms which are commonly to be found in standard terms generally used in the trade sector concerned and on the other to the individual negotiations between the parties thus for example a term excluding or limiting the contractual liability of the proponent may or may not be considered art 2120 unidroit principles 70 to be surprising and in consequence ineffective in a particular case its effectiveness depending on whether or not terms of that kind are common in the trade sector concerned and are consistent with the way in which the parties conducted their negotiations i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a travel agency offers package tours for business trips the terms of the advertisement give the impression that a is acting as a tour operator who undertakes full responsibility for the various services comprising the package b books a tour on the basis of as standard terms notwithstanding bs acceptance of the terms as a whole a may not rely on a term stating that with respect to the hotel accommodation it is acting merely as an agent for the hotelkeeper and therefore declines any liability 3 terms surprising by virtue of their language or presentation other reasons for a particular term contained in standard terms being surprising to the adhering party may be the language in which it is couched which may be obscure or the way in which it is presented typographically for instance in minute print in order to determine whether or not this is the case regard is to be had not so much to the formulation and presentation commonly used in the type of standard terms involved but more to the professional skill and experience of persons of the same kind as the adhering party thus a particular wording may be both obscure and clear at the same time depending on whether or not the adhering party belongs to the same professional category as the party using the standard terms the language factor may also play an important role in the context of international transactions if the standard terms are drafted in a foreign language it cannot be excluded that some of its terms although fairly clear in themselves will turn out to be surprising for the adhering party who could not reasonably have been expected fully to appreciate all their implications i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 a an insurance company operating in country x is an affiliate of b a company incorporated in country y as standard terms comprise some 50 terms printed in small type one of the terms designates the law of country y as the applicable law unless this term is presented in bold letters or in any other way apt to formation art 2121 71 attract the attention of the adhering party it will be without effect since customers in country x would not reasonably expect to find a choiceoflaw clause designating a foreign law as the law governing their contracts in the standard terms of a company operating in their own country 3 a a commodity dealer operating in hamburg uses in its contracts with its customers standard terms containing among others a provision stating hamburg freundschaftliche arbitrage in local business circles this clause is normally understood as meaning that possible disputes are to be submitted to a special arbitration governed by particular rules of procedure of local origin in contracts with foreign customers this clause may be held to be ineffective notwithstanding the acceptance of the standard terms as a whole since a foreign customer cannot reasonably be expected to understand its exact implications and this irrespective of whether or not the clause has been translated into the foreign customers own language 4 express acceptance of surprising terms the risk of the adhering party being taken by surprise by the kind of terms so far discussed clearly no longer exists if in a given case the other party draws the adhering partys attention to them and the adhering party accepts them this article therefore provides that a party may no longer rely on the surprising nature of a term in order to challenge its effectiveness once it has expressly accepted the term article 2121 conflict between standard terms and nonstandard terms in case of conflict between a standard term and a term which is not a standard term the latter prevails comment standard terms are by definition prepared in advance by one party or a third person and incorporated in an individual contract without their content being discussed by the parties see article 21192 it is therefore logical that whenever the parties specifically negotiate and agree on particular provisions of their contract such provisions will prevail over conflicting provisions contained in the standard terms art 2122 unidroit principles 72 since they are more likely to reflect the intention of the parties in the given case the individually agreed provisions may appear in the same document as the standard terms but may also be contained in a separate document in the first case they may easily be recognised on account of their being written in characters different from those of the standard terms in the second case it may be more difficult to distinguish between the provisions which are standard terms and those which are not and to determine their exact position in the hierarchy of the different documents to this effect the parties often include a contract provision expressly indicating the documents which form part of their contract and their respective weight special problems may however arise when the modifications to the standard terms have only been agreed upon orally without the conflicting provisions contained in the standard terms being struck out and those standard terms contain a provision stating the exclusive character of the writing signed by the parties or that any addition to or modification of their content must be in writing for these cases see articles 2117 and 2118 article 2122 battle of forms where both parties use standard terms and reach agreement except on those terms a contract is concluded on the basis of the agreed terms and of any standard terms which are common in substance unless one party clearly indicates in advance or later and without undue delay informs the other party that it does not intend to be bound by such a contract comment 1 parties using different standard terms it is quite frequent in commercial transactions for both the offeror when making the offer and the offeree when accepting it each to refer to its own standard terms in the absence of express acceptance by the offeror of the offerees standard terms the problem arises as to whether a contract is concluded at all and if so which if either of the two conflicting sets of standard terms should prevail formation art 2122 73 2 battle of forms and general rules on offer and acceptance if the general rules on offer and acceptance were to be applied there would either be no contract at all since the purported acceptance by the offeree would subject to the exception provided for in article 21112 amount to a counteroffer or if the two parties have started to perform without objecting to each others standard terms a contract would be considered to have been concluded on the basis of those terms which were the last to be sent or to be referred to the last shot 3 the knockout doctrine the last shot doctrine may be appropriate if the parties clearly indicate that the adoption of their standard terms is an essential condition for the conclusion of the contract where on the other hand the parties as is very often the case in practice refer to their standard terms more or less automatically for example by exchanging printed order and acknowledgement of order forms with the respective terms on the reverse side they will normally not even be aware of the conflict between their respective standard terms there is in such cases no reason to allow the parties subsequently to question the very existence of the contract or if performance has commenced to insist on the application of the terms last sent or referred to it is for this reason that this article provides notwithstanding the general rules on offer and acceptance that if the parties reach an agreement except on their standard terms a contract is concluded on the basis of the agreed terms and of any standard terms which are common in substance knockout doctrine i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a orders a machine from b indicating the type of machine the price and terms of payment and the date and place of delivery a uses an order form with its general conditions for purchase printed on the reverse side b accepts by sending an acknow ledgement of order form on the reverse side of which appear its own general conditions for sale when a subsequently seeks to withdraw from the deal it claims that no contract was ever concluded as there was no agreement as to which set of standard terms should apply since however the parties have agreed on the essential terms of the contract a contract has been concluded on those terms and on any standard terms which are common in substance a party may however always exclude the operation of the knock out doctrine by clearly indicating in advance or by later and without undue delay informing the other that it does not intend to be bound by a art 2122 unidroit principles 74 contract which is not based on its own standard terms what will in practice amount to such a clear indication cannot be stated in absolute terms but the inclusion of a clause of this kind in the standard terms themselves will not normally be sufficient since what is necessary is a specific declaration by the party concerned in its offer or acceptance i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that a claims that the contract was concluded on the basis of its standard terms since they contain a clause which states that deviating standard terms of the party accepting the order are not valid if they have not been confirmed in writing by us the result will be the same as in illustration 1 since merely by including such a clause in its standard terms a does not indicate with sufficient clarity its determination to conclude the contract only on its own terms 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the non standard terms of as offer contain a statement to the effect that a intends to contract only on its own standard terms the mere fact that b attaches its own standard terms to its acceptance does not prevent the contract from being concluded on the basis of as standard terms 75 section 2 authority of agents article 221 scope of the section 1 this section governs the authority of a person the agent to affect the legal relations of another person the principal by or with respect to a contract with a third party whether the agent acts in its own name or in that of the principal 2 it governs only the relations between the principal or the agent on the one hand and the third party on the other 3 it does not govern an agents authority conferred by law or the authority of an agent appointed by a public or judicial authority comment 1 scope of the section this section governs the authority of an agent to affect the legal relations between its principal and a third party in other words it focuses on the external relations between the principal or the agent on the one hand and the third party on the other and is not concerned with the internal relations between the principal and the agent even those provisions which deal with issues affecting both the internal and the external relations see eg articles 222 and 2210 on the establish ment and termination of the agents authority article 227 on conflict of interests and article 228 on subagency consider those issues only with respect to their effects on the third party the rights and duties as between principal and agent are governed by their agreement and the applicable law which with respect to specific types of agency relationships such as those concerning socalled commercial agents may provide mandatory rules for the protection of the agent 2 authority to contract the section deals only with agents who have authority to conclude contracts on behalf of their principals intermediaries whose task it is art 221 unidroit principles 76 merely to introduce two parties to one another with a view to their concluding a contract eg real estate agents or to negotiate contracts on behalf of a principal but who have no authority to bind the principal as may be the case of commercial agents are outside the scope of the section on the other hand the wording the authority to affect the legal relations of the principal by or with respect to a contract with a third party used in paragraph 1 is to be understood in a broad sense so as to comprise any act by the agent aimed at concluding a contract or which relates to its performance including giving a notice to or receiving it from the third party 3 irrelevant whether agent acts in its own name or in that of its principal contrary to a number of legal systems that distinguish between direct representation and indirect representation depending on whether the agent acts in the principals name or in its own name no such distinction is made in this section as to the distinction between disclosed and undisclosed agency see articles 223 and 224 4 voluntary nature of the relationship between principal and agent a further condition for the application of this section is the voluntary nature of the relationship between principal and agent cases where the agents authority is conferred by law eg in the field of family law matrimonial property and succession or is derived from judicial authorisation eg acting for a person without capacity to act are outside the scope of this section 5 agents of companies the authority of organs officers or partners of a corporation partnership or other entity with or without legal personality is tradi tionally governed by special rules sometimes even of a mandatory character which by virtue of their specific scope necessarily prevail over the general rules on the authority of agents laid down in this section thus for instance if under the special rules governing the authority of its organs or officers a corporation is prevented from invoking any limitation to their authority against third parties that corporation may not rely on article 2251 to claim that it is not bound by an act of its organs or officers that falls outside the scope of their authority authority of agents art 221 77 on the other hand as long as the general rules laid down in this section do not conflict with the abovementioned special rules on the authority of organs officers or partners they may well be applied in lieu of the latter thus for instance a third party seeking to demonstrate that the contract it has concluded with an officer of a corporation binds that corporation may invoke either the special rules governing the authority of that corporations organs or officers or as the case may be the general rules on apparent authority laid down in article 2252 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a chief executive officer of company b incorporated in country x has under the companys articles authority to carry out all transactions falling within the companys ordinary course of business a enters into a contract with c that clearly falls outside the scope of bs ordinary business according to section 35a of the companies act of country x in favour of a person dealing with a company in good faith the power of the board of directors to bind the company or authorise others to do so shall be deemed to be free of any limitation under the companys constitution and a person shall not be regarded as acting in bad faith by reason only of that persons knowing that an act is beyond the powers of the directors under the companys constitution b is bound by the contract between a and c even if c knew or ought to have known of the limitations to as authority and b may not rely on article 2251 to claim the contrary 2 a managing director of company b incorporated in country x has been given by the board of directors of the company the authority to carry out all transactions falling within the companys ordinary course of business except the hiring and dismissal of employees a hires c as the new accountant of bs branch in country y b refuses to be bound by this appointment on account of as lack of authority to hire employees c may overcome bs objection by invoking section 35a of the companies act of country x yet c who as a national of country y may not be familiar with that special provision of the companies act of country x may equally rely on the general rule on apparent authority laid down in article 2252 and claim that in view of as position as managing director of b it was reasonable for c to believe that a had the authority to hire employees art 222 unidroit principles 78 article 222 establishment and scope of the authority of the agent 1 the principals grant of authority to an agent may be express or implied 2 the agent has authority to perform all acts necessary in the circumstances to achieve the purposes for which the authority was granted comment 1 express or implied grant of authority paragraph 1 makes it clear that the granting of authority to the agent by the principal is not subject to any particular requirement of form and that it may be either express or implied the most common case of express authority is a power of attorney but the principal may also confer authority on the agent in an oral statement or written communication or in the case of a corporate entity in a resolution by its board of directors the granting of express authority in writing has the obvious advantage of providing clear evidence of the existence and precise scope of the agents authority to all parties concerned principal agent and third parties an implied authority exists whenever the principals intention to confer authority on an agent can be inferred from the principals conduct eg the assigning of a particular task to the agent or other circumstances of the case eg the terms of the express authorisation a particular course of dealing between the two parties or a general trade usage i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 b appoints a as manager of bs apartment building a has implied authority to conclude short term lease contracts relating to the individual apartments 2 scope of the authority the broader the mandate conferred on the agent the broader the scope of its authority accordingly paragraph 2 makes it clear that the agents authority unless otherwise provided by the principal in its authorisation is not limited to its express terms but extends to all acts authority of agents art 223 79 necessary in the circumstances to achieve the purposes for which the authority was granted i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 owner b consigns to shipmaster a a cargo to be carried to country x within 10 days with only three days of navigation left the ship is damaged and must stop in the nearest port for repairs a has implied authority to unload the cargo and consign it to another shipmaster to be carried to destination on another ship article 223 agency disclosed 1 where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent the acts of the agent shall directly affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party and no legal relation is created between the agent and the third party 2 however the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party where the agent with the consent of the principal undertakes to become the party to the contract comment 1 disclosed agency with respect to the effects of the acts of the agent this section distinguishes between two basic situations one in which the agent acts on behalf of a principal and within the scope of its authority and the third party knows or ought to know that the agent is acting as an agent and the other in which the agent acts on behalf of a principal within the scope of its authority but the third party neither knows nor ought to know that the agent is acting as an agent the first situation which is the normal one may be referred to as disclosed agency and is dealt with in this article art 223 unidroit principles 80 2 agents acts directly affect legal relations between principal and third party in the case of a disclosed agency the rule is that the agents acts directly affect the principals legal position visvis the third party paragraph 1 thus a contract made by the agent directly binds the principal and the third party to each other likewise any commu nication of intention that the agent makes to or receives from the third party affects the principals legal position as if the principal itself had made or received it i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a sales representative for computer manufacturer b accepts the order placed by university c for the purchase of a certain number of computers the sales contract directly binds b visvis c with the result that it is b and not a who is under an obligation to deliver the goods to c and who is entitled to payment by c 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that one of the computers delivered is defective the notice of such defects given by c to a directly affects b 3 acting in the principals name not necessary for the establishment of a direct relationship between the principal and the third party it is sufficient that the agent acts within the scope of its authority and that the third party knows or ought to know that the latter acts on behalf of another person by contrast it is as a rule not necessary for the agent to act in the principals name see also article 2211 in practice however there might be cases in which it is in the agents own interest to indicate expressly the identity of the person on whose behalf it is acting thus whenever the contract requires the signature of the parties the agent is well advised not simply to sign in its own name but to add language such as for and on behalf of followed by the principals name so as to avoid any risk of being held personally liable under the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 for the sales contract to directly bind b visvis c it is irrelevant whether a when accepting cs order over the telephone acts in its own name or expressly states that it is accepting in the name of b 4 computer specialist a is contacted by research centre c with a view to creating a computer programme for a special database on authority of agents art 223 81 international case law a when signing the contract in its capacity as employee of software company b should expressly state that it is acting on behalf of b if a merely signs the contract without indicating b c may hold a personally liable under the contract 4 agent undertakes to become party to the contract an agent though openly acting on behalf of a principal may exceptionally itself become party to the contract with the third party paragraph 2 this is the case in particular where a principal who wants to remain anonymous instructs the agent to act as a socalled commission agent ie to deal with the third party in its own name without establishing any direct relation between the principal and the third party this is also the case where the third party makes it clear that it does not intend to contract with anyone other than the agent and the agent with the consent of the principal agrees that it alone and not the principal will be bound by the contract in both cases it will follow from the terms of the agreement between the principal and the agent that once the agent has acquired its rights under the contract with the third party it will transfer them to the principal entirely different is the case where the agent steps in and in violation of its agreement with the principal decides to become party to the contract with the third party in so doing the agent no longer acts as an agent and this case therefore falls outside the scope of this section i l l u s t r a t i o n s 5 dealer b expecting a substantial increase in the price of wheat decides to purchase a large quantity of wheat b wishing to remain anonymous entrusts commission agent a with this task even though supplier c knows that a is purchasing on behalf of a principal the purchase contract is binding on a and c and does not directly affect bs legal position 6 confirming house a acting on behalf of overseas buyer b places an order with supplier c for the purchase of certain goods since c who does not know b insists on as confirmation of bs order a accepts to be held liable itself visvis c even though c knows that a is purchasing on behalf of b the purchase contract is binding on a and c and does not directly affect bs legal position art 224 unidroit principles 82 7 dealer b instructs agent a to purchase a certain quantity of oil on its behalf when a is about to conclude the contract with supplier c the news arrives that the oil producing countries intend to reduce production substantially a expecting a rise in oil prices decides to purchase the oil on its own behalf and enters into the contract with c as the only other party in so doing a has ceased to act as agent for the principal and the consequences of its acts are no longer governed by this section article 224 agency undisclosed 1 where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party neither knew nor ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party 2 however where such an agent when contracting with the third party on behalf of a business represents itself to be the owner of that business the third party upon discovery of the real owner of the business may exercise also against the latter the rights it has against the agent comment 1 undisclosed agency this article deals with what may be referred to as undisclosed agency ie the situation where an agent acts within the scope of its authority on behalf of a principal but the third party neither knows nor ought to know that the agent is acting as an agent 2 agents acts directly affect only the relations between agent and third party paragraph 1 provides that in the case of an undisclosed agency the agents acts affect only the relations between the agent and the third party and do not directly bind the principal visvis the third party authority of agents art 225 83 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 art dealer a purchases a painting from artist c when entering into the contract a does not disclose the fact that it is acting on behalf of client b nor has c any reason to believe that a is not acting on its own behalf the contract is binding on a and c only and does not give rise to a direct relationship between b and c 3 third partys right of action against principal notwithstanding the rule laid down in paragraph 1 the third party may exceptionally have a right of direct action also against the principal more precisely according to paragraph 2 if the third party believes that it is dealing with the owner of a business while in fact it is dealing with the owners agent it may upon discovery of the real owner exercise also against the owner the rights it has against the agent i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 manufacturer a after having transferred its assets to a newly formed company c continues to contract in its own name without disclosing to supplier b that it is in fact acting only as the managing director of c upon discovery of the existence of c b has a right of action also against that company article 225 agent acting without or exceeding its authority 1 where an agent acts without authority or exceeds its authority its acts do not affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party 2 however where the principal causes the third party reasonably to believe that the agent has authority to act on behalf of the principal and that the agent is acting within the scope of that authority the principal may not invoke against the third party the lack of authority of the agent art 225 unidroit principles 84 comment 1 lack of authority paragraph 1 expressly states that where an agent acts without authority its acts do not bind the principal and the third party to each other the same applies to the case where the agent has been granted authority of limited scope and acts exceeding its authority as to the liability of the false agent visvis the third party see article 226 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 principal b authorises agent a to buy on its behalf a specific quantity of grain but without exceeding a certain price a enters into a contract with seller c for the purchase of a greater quantity of grain and at a higher price than that authorised by b on account of as lack of authority the contract between a and c does not bind b nor does it become effective between a and c 2 apparent authority there are two cases in which an agent though acting without authority or exceeding its authority may bind the principal and the third party to each other the first case occurs whenever the principal ratifies the agents act and is dealt with in article 229 the second case is that of socalled apparent authority and is dealt with in paragraph 2 of this article according to this provision a principal whose conduct leads a third party reasonably to believe that the agent has authority to act on its behalf is prevented from invoking against the third party the lack of authority of the agent and is therefore bound by the latters act apparent authority which is an application of the general principle of good faith see article 17 and of the prohibition of inconsistent behaviour see article 18 is especially important if the principal is not an individual but an organisation in dealing with a corporation partnership or other business association a third party may find it difficult to determine whether the persons acting for the organisation have actual authority to do so and may therefore prefer whenever possible to rely on their apparent authority for this purpose the third party only has to demonstrate that it was reasonable for it to believe that the person purporting to represent the organisation was authorised authority of agents art 226 85 to do so and that this belief was caused by the conduct of those actually authorised to represent the organisation board of directors executive officers partners etc whether or not the third partys belief was reasonable will depend on the circumstances of the case position occupied by the apparent agent in the organisations hierarchy type of transaction involved acquiescence of the organisations representatives in the past etc i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 a a manager of one of company bs branch offices though lacking actual authority to do so engages construction company c to redecorate the branchs premises in view of the fact that a branch manager normally would have authority to enter into such a contract b is bound by the contract with c since it was reasonable for c to believe that a had actual authority to enter into the contract 3 a chief financial officer of company b though lacking authority to do so has with the acquiescence of the board of directors repeatedly entered into financial transactions with bank c on behalf of b on the occasion of a new transaction which proves to be disadvantageous to b bs board of directors raises against c the objection of as lack of authority c may defeat this objection by claiming that b is bound by as apparent authority to enter into the financial transaction on bs behalf article 226 liability of agent acting without or exceeding its authority 1 an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority is failing ratification by the principal liable for damages that will place the third party in the same position as if the agent had acted with authority and not exceeded its authority 2 however the agent is not liable if the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent had no authority or was exceeding its authority art 226 unidroit principles 86 comment 1 liability of false agent it is generally recognised that an agent acting without authority or exceeding its authority shall failing ratification by the principal be liable for damages to the third party paragraph 1 in stating that the false agent shall be liable to pay the third party such compensation as will place the third party in the same position as it would have been in if the agent had acted with authority makes it clear that the liability of the false agent is not limited to the socalled reliance or negative interest but extends to the socalled expectation or positive interest in other words the third party may recover the profit that would have resulted if the contract concluded with the false agent had been a valid one i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 agent a without being authorised by principal b enters into a contract with third party c for the sale of a cargo of oil belonging to b failing bs ratification of the contract c may recover from a the difference between the contract price and the current market price 2 third partys knowledge of agents lack of authority the false agent is liable to the third party only to the extent that the third party when entering into the contract with the false agent neither knew nor ought to have known that the latter was acting without authority or exceeding its authority i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a a junior employee of company b without having authority to do so engages construction company c to redecorate bs premises b refuses to ratify the contract nevertheless c may not request damages from a since it should have known that an employee of as rank normally has no authority to enter into such a contract authority of agents art 227 87 article 227 conflict of interests 1 if a contract concluded by an agent involves the agent in a conflict of interests with the principal of which the third party knew or ought to have known the principal may avoid the contract the right to avoid is subject to articles 329 and 3211 to 3215 2 however the principal may not avoid the contract a if the principal had consented to or knew or ought to have known of the agents involvement in the conflict of interests or b if the agent had disclosed the conflict of interests to the principal and the latter had not objected within a reasonable time comment 1 conflict of interests between agent and principal it is inherent in any agency relationship that the agent in fulfilling its mandate will act in the interest of the principal and not in its own interest or in that of anyone else if there is a conflict between such an interest and that of the principal the most frequent cases of potential conflict of interests are those where the agent acts for two principals and those where the agent concludes the contract with itself or with a firm in which it has an interest however in practice even in such cases a real conflict of interests may not exist thus for instance the agents acting for two principals may be in conformity with the usages of the trade sector concerned or the principal may have conferred on the agent a mandate which is so stringent as to leave it no margin for manoeuvre 2 conflict of interests as grounds for avoidance of the contract paragraph 1 of this article lays down the rule that a contract concluded by an agent acting in a situation of real conflict of interests may be avoided by the principal provided that the third party knew or ought to have known of the conflict of interests the requirement of the actual or constructive knowledge of the third party is intended to protect the innocent third partys interest in art 227 unidroit principles 88 preserving the contract this requirement is obviously no longer relevant where the agent concludes the contract with itself and is therefore at one and the same time agent and third party i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 solicitor a is requested by foreign client b to purchase on its behalf an apartment in as city a buys an apartment client c has requested a to sell on its behalf b may avoid the contract if it can prove that c knew or ought to have known of as conflict of interests likewise c may avoid the contract if it can prove that b knew or ought to have known of as conflict of interests 2 sales agent a requested by retailer b to purchase certain goods on its behalf purchases the goods from company c in which a is a majority shareholder b may avoid the contract if it can prove that c knew or ought to have known of as conflict of interests 3 client b instructs bank a to buy on its behalf one thousand shares of company c at the closing price of day m on the stock exchange of city y even if a sells b the requested shares from out of those it has in its own portfolio there can be no conflict of interests because bs mandate leaves a no margin for manoeuvre 4 a chief executive officer of company b has authority to appoint the companys counsel in the event of a law suit being brought by or against b a appoints itself as bs counsel b may avoid the contract 3 procedure for avoidance as to the procedure for avoidance the provisions laid down in articles 329 confirmation 3211 notice of avoidance 3212 time limits 3213 partial avoidance 3214 retroactive effect of avoidance and 3215 restitution apply 4 avoidance excluded according to paragraph 2 the principal loses its right to avoid the contract if it has given its prior consent to the agents acting in a situation of conflict of interests or at any rate knew or ought to have known that the agent would do so the right of avoidance is likewise excluded if the principal having been informed by the agent of the contract it has concluded in a situation of conflict of interests raises no objection authority of agents art 228 89 i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that before concluding the contract a duly informs b that it is acting as agent also for c if b does not object b loses its right to avoid the contract likewise if a duly informs c that it is acting as agent also for b and c does not object c loses its right to avoid the contract 5 issues not covered by this article in conformity with the scope of this section set out in article 221 this article addresses only the impact that the agents involvement in a conflict of interests situation may have on the external relationship issues such as the agents duty of full disclosure visvis the principal and the principals right to damages from the agent may be settled on the basis of other provisions of the principles see articles 17 3216 741 et seq or are otherwise governed by the law applicable to the internal relationship between principal and agent article 228 subagency an agent has implied authority to appoint a subagent to perform acts which it is not reasonable to expect the agent to perform itself the rules of this section apply to the subagency comment 1 role of subagents in carrying out the mandate conferred on it by the principal an agent may find it convenient or even necessary to avail itself of the services of other persons this is the case for instance where certain tasks are to be performed in a place distant from the agents place of business or if a more efficient performance of the agents mandate requires distribution of work 2 implied authority to appoint subagents whether or not the agent is authorised to appoint one or more sub agents depends on the terms of the authority granted by the principal art 228 unidroit principles 90 thus the principal may expressly exclude the appointment of sub agents or make it conditional upon its prior approval if nothing is said in the authorisation as to the possibility of appointing subagents and the terms of the authority granted are not otherwise inconsistent with such a possibility the agent has the right under this article to appoint sub agents the only limitation is that the agent may not entrust the sub agents with tasks that it is reasonable to expect the agent itself to perform this is the case in particular of acts requiring the agents personal expertise i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 chinese museum b instructs a londonbased art dealer a to buy a particular piece of greek pottery on sale at a private auction in germany a has implied authority to appoint german subagent s to purchase that piece of pottery at the auction in germany and to send it to b 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b does not specify the particular piece of greek pottery to be acquired at the auction in germany as it relies on as expertise to choose the most suitable item offered for sale a is expected to make the purchase at the auction itself but once it has purchased the piece of pottery it may appoint subagent s to send it to b 3 effects of a subagents acts this article expressly states that the rules of this section apply to the subagency in other words the acts of a subagent legitimately appointed by the agent bind the principal and the third party to each other provided that those acts are within both the agents authority and the authority conferred on the subagent by the agent which may be more limited i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 the purchase of the piece of greek pottery by s directly binds b provided that it is within both the authority that b has granted to a and the authority that a has granted to s authority of agents art 229 91 article 229 ratification 1 an act by an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority may be ratified by the principal on ratification the act produces the same effects as if it had initially been carried out with authority 2 the third party may by notice to the principal specify a reasonable period of time for ratification if the principal does not ratify within that period of time it can no longer do so 3 if at the time of the agents act the third party neither knew nor ought to have known of the lack of authority it may at any time before ratification by notice to the principal indicate its refusal to become bound by a ratification comment 1 notion of ratification this article lays down the generally accepted principle whereby acts which have no effect on the principal because they have been carried out by an agent holding itself out to have authority but actually without authority or exceeding its authority may be authorised by the principal at a later stage such subsequent authorisation is known as ratification like the original authorisation ratification is not subject to any requirement as to form as it is a unilateral manifestation of intent it may be either express or implied from words or conduct and though normally communicated to the agent to the third party or to both it need not be communicated to anyone provided that it is manifested in some way and can therefore be ascertained by probative material i l l u s t r a t i o n agent a purchases on behalf of principal b goods from third party c at a price higher than that which a is authorised to pay upon receipt of cs bill b makes no objection and pays it by bank transfer the payment amounts to ratification of as act even if b does not expressly declare its intention to ratify fails to inform art 229 unidroit principles 92 both a and c of the payment and c is only subsequently informed of the payment by its bank 2 effects of ratification on ratification the agents acts produce the same effects as if they had been carried out with authority from the outset paragraph 1 it follows that the third party may refuse partial ratification of the agents acts by the principal as it would amount to a proposal by the principal to modify the contract that the third party has concluded with the agent in turn the principal may not revoke ratification after it has been brought to the attention of the third party otherwise the principal would be in a position to withdraw unilaterally from the contract with the third party 3 time of ratification the principal may in principle ratify at any time the reason for this is that normally the third party does not even know that it has contracted with an agent who did not have authority or who exceeded its authority however even if the third party knows from the outset or subsequently becomes aware that the agent was a false agent it will have a legitimate interest not to be left in doubt indefinitely as to the ultimate fate of the contract concluded with the false agent accordingly paragraph 2 grants the third party the right to set a reasonable time limit within which the principal must ratify if it intends to do so it goes without saying that in such a case ratification must be notified to the third party 4 ratification excluded by third party a third party who when dealing with the agent neither knew nor ought to have known of that agents lack of authority may exclude ratification by giving the principal notice to this effect any time before ratification by the latter the reason for granting the innocent third party such a right is to avoid that the principal is the only one in a position to speculate and to decide whether or not to ratify depending on market developments 5 third persons rights not affected this article deals only with the effects of ratification on the three parties directly involved in the agency relationship ie the principal the agent and the third party in accordance with the scope of this authority of agents art 2210 93 section as defined in article 221 the rights of other third persons are not affected for instance if the same goods have been sold first by the false agent to c and subsequently by the principal to another person d the conflict between c and d as a result of the principals subsequent ratification of the first sale will have to be solved by the applicable law article 2210 termination of authority 1 termination of authority is not effective in relation to the third party unless the third party knew or ought to have known of it 2 notwithstanding the termination of its authority an agent remains authorised to perform the acts that are necessary to prevent harm to the principals interests comment 1 grounds for termination not covered by this article there are several grounds on which the agents authority may be terminated revocation by the principal renunciation by the agent completion of the acts for which authority had been granted loss of capacity bankruptcy death or cessation of the existence of the principal or the agent etc what exactly constitutes a ground for termination and the way it operates as between the principal and the agent falls outside the scope of this article and is to be determined in accordance with the applicable laws eg the law governing the internal relations between principal and agent the law governing their legal status or personality the law governing bankruptcy etc which may vary considerably from one country to another 2 termination effective visvis third party whatever the grounds for termination of the agents authority in relation to the third party termination is not effective unless the third party knew or ought to have known of it paragraph 1 in other words even if the agents authority has been terminated for one reason or another the agents acts continue to affect the legal relationship art 2210 unidroit principles 94 between the principal and the third party as long as the third party is neither aware of nor ought to know that the agent no longer has authority obviously the situation is clear whenever either the principal or the agent gives the third party notice of the termination in the absence of such notice it will depend on the circumstances of the case whether the third party ought to have known of the termination i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 principal b opens a branch office in city x an advertisement published in the local newspaper indicates managing director a as having full authority to act on behalf of b when b subsequently revokes as authority a similar notice thereof in the same newspaper is sufficient to make the termination effective visvis bs customers in city x 2 retailer c has repeatedly placed orders with sales represent ative a for the purchase of goods sold by principal b a continues to accept orders from c even after its authority has been terminated on account of bs bankruptcy the mere fact that the bankruptcy proceedings were given the publicity required by the applicable law is not sufficient to make the termination effective visvis c 3 authority of necessity even after termination of the agents authority the circumstances of the case may make it necessary for the agent to perform additional acts in order to prevent the principals interests from being harmed i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 agent a has authority to purchase a certain quantity of perishable goods on behalf of principal b after the purchase of the goods a is informed of bs death notwithstanding the termination of its authority a continues to be authorised either to resell the goods or to store them in a suitable warehouse 4 restriction of authority also covered the rules of this article apply not only to termination but with appropriate modifications also to subsequent restrictions of an agents authority 95 chapter 3 validity section 1 general provisions article 311 matters not covered this chapter does not deal with lack of capacity comment this article makes it clear that not all the grounds of invalidity of a contract to be found in the various national legal systems fall within the scope of the principles this is in particular the case of lack of capacity the reason for its exclusion lies in both the inherent complexity of questions of status and the extremely diverse manner in which these questions are treated in domestic law in consequence matters such as ultra vires will continue to be governed by the applicable law as to the authority of organs officers or partners of a corporation partnership or other entities to bind their respective entities see comment 5 on article 221 article 312 validity of mere agreement a contract is concluded modified or ter minated by the mere agreement of the parties without any further requirement art 312 unidroit principles 96 comment the purpose of this article is to make it clear that the mere agreement of the parties is sufficient for the valid conclusion modification or termination by agreement of a contract without any of the further requirements which are to be found in some domestic laws 1 no need for consideration in common law systems consideration is traditionally seen as a prerequisite for the validity or enforceability of a contract as well as for the modification or termination of a contract by the parties however in commercial dealings this requirement is of minimal practical importance since in that context obligations are almost always undertaken by both parties it is for this reason that article 291 cisg dispenses with the requirement of consideration in relation to the modification and termination by the parties of contracts for the international sale of goods the fact that this article extends this approach to the conclusion modification and termination by the parties of international commercial contracts in general can only bring about greater certainty and reduce litigation 2 no need for cause this article also excludes the requirement of cause which exists in some civil law systems and is in certain respects functionally similar to the common law consideration i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 at the request of its french customer a bank b in paris issues a guarantee on first demand in favour of c a business partner of a in england neither b nor a can invoke the possible absence of consideration or cause for the guarantee it should be noted however that this article is not concerned with the effects which may derive from other aspects of cause such as its illegality see comment 2 on article 331 3 all contracts consensual some civil law systems have retained certain types of real contract ie contracts concluded only upon the actual handing over of the goods concerned these rules are not easily compatible with modern validity art 313 97 business perceptions and practice and are therefore excluded by this article i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 two french businessmen a and b agree with c a real estate developer to lend c eur 300000 on 2 july on 25 june a and b inform c that unexpectedly they need the money for their own business c is entitled to receive the loan although the loan is generally considered a real contract in france article 313 initial impossibility 1 the mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract the performance of the obligation assumed was impossible does not affect the validity of the contract 2 the mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract a party was not entitled to dispose of the assets to which the contract relates does not affect the validity of the contract comment 1 performance impossible from the outset contrary to a number of legal systems which consider a contract of sale void if the specific goods sold have already perished at the time of conclusion of the contract paragraph 1 of this article in conformity with the most modern trends states in general terms that the mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract the performance of the obligation assumed was impossible does not affect the validity of the contract a contract is valid even if the assets to which it relates have already perished at the time of contracting with the consequence that initial impossibility of performance is equated with impossibility occurring after the conclusion of the contract the rights and duties of the parties arising from one partys or possibly even both parties inability to perform are to be determined according to the rules on nonperformance under these rules appropriate weight may be attached for example to the fact that the obligor or the obligee already knew of the impossibility of performance at the time of contracting the rule laid down in paragraph 1 also art 313 unidroit principles 98 removes possible doubts as to the validity of contracts for the delivery of future goods if an initial impossibility of performance is due to a legal prohibition eg an export or import embargo the validity of the contract depends upon whether under the law enacting the prohibition the latter is intended to invalidate the contract or merely to prohibit its performance paragraph 1 moreover departs from the rule to be found in some civil law systems according to which the object objet of a contract must be possible the paragraph also deviates from the rule of the same systems which requires the existence of a cause since in a case of initial impossibility the cause for a counterperformance is lacking see article 312 2 lack of legal title or power paragraph 2 of this article deals with cases where the party promising to transfer or deliver assets was not entitled to dispose of the assets because it lacked legal title or the right of disposition at the time of the conclusion of the contract some legal systems declare a contract of sale concluded in such circumstances to be void yet as in the case with initial impossibility and for even more cogent reasons paragraph 2 of this article considers such a contract to be valid indeed a contracting party may and often does acquire legal title to or the power of disposition over the assets in question after the conclusion of the contract should this not occur the rules on nonperformance will apply cases where the power of disposition is lacking must be distinguished from those of lack of capacity the latter relate to certain disabilities of a person which may affect all or at least some types of contract concluded by it and falls outside the scope of the principles see article 311 validity art 314 99 article 314 mandatory character of the provisions the provisions on fraud threat gross disparity and illegality contained in this chapter are mandatory comment the provisions of this chapter relating to fraud threat gross disparity and illegality are of a mandatory character it would be contrary to good faith for the parties to exclude or modify these provisions when concluding their contract however nothing prevents the party entitled to avoidance for fraud threat and gross disparity to waive that right once that party learns of the true facts or is able to act freely on the other hand the provisions of this chapter relating to the binding force of a mere agreement to initial impossibility or to mistake are not mandatory thus the parties may reintroduce special requirements of domestic law such as consideration or cause they may likewise agree that their contract shall be invalid in case of initial impossibility or that mistake by one of the parties is not a ground for avoidance 100 section 2 grounds for avoidance article 321 definition of mistake mistake is an erroneous assumption relating to facts or to law existing when the contract was concluded comment 1 mistake of fact and mistake of law this article equates a mistake relating to facts with a mistake relating to law identical legal treatment of the two types of mistake seems justified in view of the increasing complexity of modern legal systems for crossborder trade the difficulties caused by this complexity are exacerbated by the fact that an individual transaction may be affected by foreign and therefore unfamiliar legal systems 2 decisive time this article indicates that a mistake must involve an erroneous assumption relating to the factual or legal circumstances that exist at the time of the conclusion of the contract the purpose of fixing this time element is to distinguish cases where the rules on mistake with their particular remedies apply from those relating to nonperformance indeed a typical case of mistake may depending on the point of view taken often just as well be seen as one involving an obstacle which prevents or impedes the performance of the contract if a party has entered into a contract under a misconception as to the factual or legal context and therefore misjudged its prospects under that contract the rules on mistake will apply if on the other hand a party has a correct understanding of the surrounding circumstances but makes an error of judgment as to its prospects under the contract and later refuses to perform then the case is one of non performance rather than mistake grounds for avoidance art 322 101 article 322 relevant mistake 1 a party may only avoid the contract for mistake if when the contract was concluded the mistake was of such importance that a reasonable person in the same situation as the party in error would only have concluded the contract on materially different terms or would not have concluded it at all if the true state of affairs had been known and a the other party made the same mistake or caused the mistake or knew or ought to have known of the mistake and it was contrary to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing to leave the mistaken party in error or b the other party had not at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the contract 2 however a party may not avoid the contract if a it was grossly negligent in committing the mistake or b the mistake relates to a matter in regard to which the risk of mistake was assumed or having regard to the circumstances should be borne by the mistaken party comment this article states the conditions necessary for a mistake to be relevant with a view to avoidance of the contract the introductory part of paragraph 1 determines the conditions under which a mistake is sufficiently serious to be taken into account subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 1 add the conditions regarding the party other than the mistaken party paragraph 2 deals with the conditions regarding the mistaken party 1 serious mistake to be relevant a mistake must be serious its weight and importance are to be assessed by reference to a combined objectivesubjective standard namely what a reasonable person in the same situation as art 322 unidroit principles 102 the party in error would have done if it had known the true circumstances at the time of the conclusion of the contract if it would not have contracted at all or would have done so only on materially different terms then and only then is the mistake considered to be serious in this context the introductory part of paragraph 1 relies on an openended formula rather than indicating specific essential elements of the contract to which the mistake must relate this flexible approach allows full account to be taken of the intentions of the parties and the circumstances of the case in ascertaining the parties intentions the rules of interpretation laid down in chapter 4 must be applied general commercial standards and relevant usages will be particularly important normally in commercial transactions certain mistakes such as those concerning the value of goods or services or mere expectations or motivations of the mistaken party are not considered to be relevant the same is true of mistakes as to the identity of the other party or its personal qualities although special circumstances may sometimes render such mistakes relevant eg when services to be rendered require certain personal qualifications or when a loan is based upon the credit worthiness of the borrower the fact that a reasonable person would consider the circumstances erroneously assumed to be essential is however not sufficient since additional requirements concerning both the mistaken and the other party must be met if a mistake is to become relevant 2 conditions concerning the party other than the mistaken party a mistaken party may avoid the contract only if the other party satisfies one of four conditions laid down in paragraph 1 the first three conditions indicated in subparagraph a have in common the fact that the other party does not deserve protection because of its involvement in one way or another with the mistaken partys error the first condition is that both parties laboured under the same mistake i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a and b when concluding a contract for the sale of a sports car were not and could not have been aware of the fact that the car had in the meantime been stolen avoidance of the contract is admissible however if the parties erroneously believe the object of the contract to be in existence at the time of the conclusion of the contract while in grounds for avoidance art 322 103 reality it had already been destroyed article 313 has to be taken into account the second condition is that the error of the mistaken party is caused by the other party this is the case whenever the error can be traced to specific representations made by the latter party be they express or implied negligent or innocent or to conduct which in the circumstances amounts to a representation even silence may cause an error a mere puff in advertising or in negotiations will normally be tolerated if the error was caused intentionally article 325 applies the third condition is that the other party knew or ought to have known of the error of the mistaken party and that it was contrary to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing to leave the mistaken party in error what the other party ought to have known is what should have been known to a reasonable person in the same situation as that party in order to avoid the contract the mistaken party must also show that the other party was under a duty to inform it of its error the fourth condition is laid down in subparagraph b and is that the party other than the mistaken party had not up to the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the contract for the time of avoidance see articles 3212 and 110 3 conditions concerning the mistaken party paragraph 2 of this article mentions two cases in which the mistaken party may not avoid the contract the first of these dealt with in subparagraph a is that the error is due to the gross negligence of the mistaken party in such a situation it would be unfair to the other party to allow the mistaken party to avoid the contract subparagraph b contemplates the situation where the mistaken party either has assumed the risk of mistake or where this risk should in the circumstances be borne by it an assumption of the risk of mistake is a frequent feature of speculative contracts a party may conclude a contract in the hope that its assumption of the existence of certain facts will prove to be correct but may nevertheless undertake to assume the risk of this not being so in such circumstances it will not be entitled to avoid the contract for its mistake art 323 unidroit principles 104 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a sells to b a picture attributed to the relatively unknown painter c at a fair price for such paintings it is subsequently discovered that the work was painted by the famous artist d a cannot avoid its contract with b on the ground of its mistake since the fact that the picture was only attributed to c implied the risk that it might have been painted by a more famous artist sometimes both parties assume a risk however speculative contracts involving conflicting expectations of future developments eg those concerning prices and exchange rates may not be avoided on the ground of mistake since the mistake would not be one as to facts existing at the time of the conclusion of the contract article 323 error in expression or transmission an error occurring in the expression or transmission of a declaration is considered to be a mistake of the person from whom the declaration emanated comment this article equates an error in the expression or transmission of a declaration with an ordinary mistake of the person making the declaration or sending it and thus the rules of article 314 article 322 and articles 329 to 3216 apply also to these kinds of error 1 relevant mistake if an error in expression or transmission is of sufficient magnitude especially if it has resulted in the misstatement of figures the receiver will be or ought to be aware of the error since nothing in the principles prevents the receiverofferee from accepting the erroneously expressed or transmitted offer it is for the senderofferor to invoke the error and to avoid the contract provided that the conditions of article 322 are met in particular that it was contrary to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing for the receiverofferee not to inform the senderofferor of the error grounds for avoidance art 324 105 in some cases the risk of the error may have been assumed by or may have to be imposed upon the sender if it uses a method of transmission which it knows or ought to know to be unsafe either in general or in the special circumstances of the case 2 mistakes on the part of the receiver transmission ends as soon as the message reaches the receiver see article 110 if the message is correctly transmitted but the receiver misunder stands its content the case falls outside the scope of this article if the message is correctly transmitted to the receivers machine which however due to a technical fault prints out a mutilated text the case is again outside the scope of this article the same is true if at the receivers request a message is given orally to the receivers messenger who misunderstands it or transmits it wrongly in the two abovementioned situations the receiver may however be entitled to invoke its own mistake in accordance with article 322 if it replies to the sender and bases its reply upon its own misunderstanding of the senders message and if all the conditions of article 322 are met article 324 remedies for nonperformance a party is not entitled to avoid the contract on the ground of mistake if the circumstances on which that party relies afford or could have afforded a remedy for nonperformance comment 1 remedies for nonperformance preferred this article is intended to resolve the conflict which may arise between the remedy of avoidance for mistake and the remedies for non performance in the event of such a conflict preference is given to the remedies for nonperformance since they seem to be better suited and are more flexible than the radical solution of avoidance art 325 unidroit principles 106 2 actual and potential conflicts an actual conflict between the remedies for mistake and those for nonperformance arises whenever the two sets of remedies are invoked in relation to what are essentially the same facts i l l u s t r a t i o n a a farmer who finds a rusty cup on the land sells it to b an art dealer for eur 10000 the high price is based upon the assumption of both parties that the cup is made of silver other silver objects had previously been found on the land it subsequently turns out that the object in question is an ordinary iron cup worth only eur 1000 b refuses to accept the cup and to pay for it on the ground that it lacks the assumed quality b also avoids the contract on the ground of mistake as to the quality of the cup b is entitled only to the remedies for nonperformance it may be that the conflict between the two sets of remedies is only potential since the mistaken party could have relied upon a remedy for nonperformance but is actually precluded from doing so by special circumstances for example because a statutory limitation period has lapsed even in such a case this article applies with the consequence that the remedy of avoidance for mistake is excluded article 325 fraud a party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other partys fraudulent representation including language or practices or fraudulent non disclosure of circumstances which according to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing the latter party should have disclosed comment 1 fraud and mistake avoidance of a contract by a party on the ground of fraud bears some resemblance to avoidance for a certain type of mistake fraud may be regarded as a special case of mistake caused by the other grounds for avoidance art 326 107 party fraud like mistake may involve either representations whether express or implied of false facts or nondisclosure of true facts 2 notion of fraud the decisive distinction between fraud and mistake lies in the nature and purpose of the defrauding partys representations or nondisclosure what entitles the defrauded party to avoid the contract is the fraudulent representation or nondisclosure of relevant facts such conduct is fraudulent if it is intended to lead the other party into error and thereby to gain an advantage to the detriment of the other party the reprehensible nature of fraud is such that it is a sufficient ground for avoidance without the need for the presence of the additional conditions laid down in article 322 for the mistake to become relevant a mere puff in advertising or negotiations does not suffice article 326 threat a party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other partys unjustified threat which having regard to the circumstances is so imminent and serious as to leave the first party no reasonable alternative in particular a threat is unjustified if the act or omission with which a party has been threatened is wrongful in itself or it is wrongful to use it as a means to obtain the conclusion of the contract comment this article permits the avoidance of a contract on the ground of threat 1 threat must be imminent and serious threat of itself is not sufficient it must be of so imminent and serious a character that the threatened person has no reasonable alternative but to conclude the contract on the terms proposed by the art 326 unidroit principles 108 other party the imminence and seriousness of the threat must be evaluated by an objective standard taking into account the circumstances of the individual case 2 unjustified threat the threat must in addition be unjustified the second sentence of this article sets out by way of illustration two examples of an unjustified threat the first envisages a case where the act or omission with which the contracting party has been threatened is wrongful in itself eg a physical attack the second refers to a situation where the threatened act or omission is in itself lawful but the purpose to be achieved is wrongful eg the bringing of a court action for the sole purpose of inducing the other party to conclude the contract on the terms proposed i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a who is in default with the repayment of a loan is threatened by b the lender with proceedings for the recovery of the money the only purpose of this threat is to obtain on particularly advantageous terms a lease of as warehouse a signs the lease but is entitled to avoid the contract 3 threat affecting reputation or economic interests for the purpose of the application of this article threat need not necessarily be made against a person or property but may also affect reputation or purely economic interests i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 faced with a threat by the players of a basketball team to go on strike unless they receive a much higher bonus than had already been agreed for winning the four remaining matches of the season the owner of the team agrees to pay the requested bonus the owner is entitled to avoid the new contract with the players since the strike would have led automatically to the team being relegated to a minor league and therefore represented a serious and imminent threat to both the reputation and the financial position of the club grounds for avoidance art 327 109 article 327 gross disparity 1 a party may avoid the contract or an individual term of it if at the time of the con clusion of the contract the contract or term unjustifiably gave the other party an excessive advantage regard is to be had among other factors to a the fact that the other party has taken unfair advantage of the first partys dependence economic distress or urgent needs or of its improvidence ignorance inexperience or lack of bargaining skill and b the nature and purpose of the contract 2 upon the request of the party entitled to avoidance a court may adapt the contract or term in order to make it accord with reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing 3 a court may also adapt the contract or term upon the request of the party receiving notice of avoidance provided that that party informs the other party of its request promptly after receiving such notice and before the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on it article 32102 applies accordingly comment 1 excessive advantage this provision permits a party to avoid a contract in cases where there is gross disparity between the obligations of the parties which gives one party an unjustifiably excessive advantage the excessive advantage must exist at the time of the conclusion of the contract a contract which although not grossly unfair when entered into becomes so later may be adapted or terminated under the rules on hardship contained in chapter 6 section 2 as the term excessive advantage denotes even a considerable disparity in the value and the price or some other element which upsets the equilibrium of performance and counterperformance is not art 327 unidroit principles 110 sufficient to permit the avoidance or the adaptation of the contract under this article what is required is that the disequilibrium is in the circumstances so great as to shock the conscience of a reasonable person 2 unjustifiable advantage not only must the advantage be excessive it must also be unjus tifiable whether this requirement is met will depend upon an evaluation of all the relevant circumstances of the case paragraph 1 of this article refers in particular to two factors which deserve special attention in this connection a unequal bargaining position the first factor is that one party has taken unfair advantage of the other partys dependence economic distress or urgent needs or its improvidence ignorance inexperience or lack of bargaining skill sub paragraph a as to the dependence of one party visvis the other superior bargaining power due to market conditions alone is not sufficient i l l u s t r a t i o n a the owner of an automobile factory sells an outdated assembly line to b a governmental agency from a country eager to set up its own automobile industry although a makes no representations as to the efficiency of the assembly line it succeeds in fixing a price which is manifestly excessive b after discovering that it has paid an amount which corresponds to that of a much more modern assembly line is entitled to avoid the contract b nature and purpose of the contract the second factor to which special regard must be had is the nature and purpose of the contract subparagraph b there are situations where an excessive advantage is unjustifiable even if the party who will benefit from it has not abused the other partys weak bargaining position whether this is the case will often depend upon the nature and purpose of the contract thus a contract term providing for an extremely short period for giving notice of defects in goods or services to be supplied may or may not be excessively advantageous to the seller or supplier depending on the character of the goods or services in question grounds for avoidance art 328 111 equally an agents fee expressed in terms of a fixed percentage of the price of the goods or services to be sold or rendered although justified in the event of the agents contribution to the conclusion of the transaction being substantial andor the value of the goods or services concerned not being very high may well turn out to confer an excessive advantage on the agent if the latters contribution is almost negligible andor the value of the goods or services are extraordinarily high c other factors other factors may need to be taken into consideration for example the ethics prevailing in the business or trade 3 avoidance or adaptation the avoidance of the contract or of any of its individual terms under this article is subject to the general rules laid down in articles 3211 to 3216 however according to paragraph 2 of this article at the request of the party who is entitled to avoidance the court may adapt the contract in order to bring it into accord with reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing similarly according to paragraph 3 the party receiving notice of avoidance may also request such adaptation provided it informs the avoiding party of its request promptly after receiving the notice of avoidance and before the avoiding party has reasonably acted in reliance on that notice after such a request by the other party the party entitled to avoidance looses its right to avoid the contract and any earlier notice of avoidance becomes ineffective see article 32102 if the parties are in disagreement as to the procedure to be adopted it will be for the court to decide whether the contract is to be avoided or adapted and if adapted on which terms article 328 third persons 1 where fraud threat gross disparity or a partys mistake is imputable to or is known or ought to be known by a third person for whose acts the other party is responsible the contract may be avoided under the same conditions as if the behaviour or knowledge had been that of the party itself art 328 unidroit principles 112 2 where fraud threat or gross disparity is imputable to a third person for whose acts the other party is not responsible the contract may be avoided if that party knew or ought to have known of the fraud threat or disparity or has not at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the contract comment this article deals with situations frequent in practice in which a third person has been involved or has interfered in the negotiation process and the ground for avoidance is in one way or another imputable to that person 1 third person for whom a party is responsible paragraph 1 is concerned with cases in which fraud threat gross disparity or a partys mistake is caused by a third person for whose acts the other party is responsible or cases in which without causing the mistake the third person knew or ought to have known of it a party is responsible for the acts of a third person in a variety of situations ranging from those in which that person is an agent of the party in question to those where the third person acts for the benefit of that party on its own initiative in all such cases it seems justified to impute to that party the third persons acts or its knowledge whether actual or constructive of certain circumstances and this irrespective of whether the party in question knew of the third persons acts 2 third person for whom a party is not responsible paragraph 2 deals with cases where a party is defrauded threatened or otherwise unduly influenced by a third person for whom the other party is not responsible such acts may be imputed to the latter party only if it knew or ought to have known of them there is however one exception to this rule the defrauded threatened or otherwise unduly influenced party is entitled to avoid the contract even if the other party did not know of the third persons acts whenever the other party has not reasonably acted in reliance on the contract before the time of avoidance this exception is justified because in this situation the other party is not in need of protection grounds for avoidance art 3210 113 article 329 confirmation if the party entitled to avoid the contract expressly or impliedly confirms the contract after the period of time for giving notice of avoidance has begun to run avoidance of the contract is excluded comment this article lays down the rule according to which the party entitled to avoid the contract may either expressly or impliedly confirm the contract for there to be an implied confirmation it is not sufficient for example for the party entitled to avoid the contract to bring a claim against the other party based on the latters nonperformance a confirmation can only be assumed if the other party acknowledges the claim or if a court action has been successful there is also confirmation if the party entitled to avoidance continues to perform the contract without reserving its right to avoid the contract article 3210 loss of right to avoid 1 if a party is entitled to avoid the contract for mistake but the other party declares itself willing to perform or performs the contract as it was understood by the party entitled to avoidance the contract is considered to have been concluded as the latter party understood it the other party must make such a declaration or render such performance promptly after having been informed of the manner in which the party entitled to avoidance had understood the contract and before that party has reasonably acted in reliance on a notice of avoidance 2 after such a declaration or perform ance the right to avoidance is lost and any earlier notice of avoidance is ineffective art 3210 unidroit principles 114 comment 1 performance of the contract as understood by the mistaken party according to this article a mistaken party may be prevented from avoiding the contract if the other party declares itself willing to perform or actually performs the contract as it was understood by the mistaken party the interest of the other party in so doing may lie in the benefit to be derived from the contract even in its adapted form such regard for the interests of the other party is only justified in the case of mistake and not in other cases of defective consent threat and fraud where it would be extremely difficult to expect the parties to keep the contract alive 2 decision to be made promptly the other party has to declare its decision to perform or actually to perform the contract in its adapted form promptly after having been informed of the manner in which the mistaken party had understood the contract how the other party is to receive the information about the erroneous understanding of the terms of the contract will depend on the circumstances of the case 3 loss of right to avoid paragraph 2 expressly states that after the other partys declaration or performance the right of the mistaken party to avoid the contract is lost and that any earlier notice of avoidance becomes ineffective conversely the other party is no longer entitled to adapt the contract if the mistaken party has not only given notice of avoidance but has also reasonably acted in reliance on that notice 4 damages the adaptation of the contract by the other party does not preclude the mistaken party from claiming damages in accordance with article 3216 if it has suffered loss which is not compensated by the adaptation of the contract grounds for avoidance art 3211 115 article 3211 notice of avoidance the right of a party to avoid the contract is exercised by notice to the other party comment 1 the requirement of notice this article states the principle that the right of a party to avoid the contract is exercised by notice to the other party without the need for any intervention by a court 2 form and content of notice no provision is made in this article for any specific requirement as to the form or content of the notice of avoidance it follows that in accordance with the general rule laid down in article 1101 the notice may be given by any means appropriate to the circumstances as to the content of the notice it is not necessary that the term avoidance actually be used or that the reasons for avoiding the contract be stated expressly however for the sake of clarity a party would be well advised to give some reasons for the avoidance in its notice although in cases of fraud or gross disparity the avoiding party may assume that those reasons are already known to the other party i l l u s t r a t i o n a bs employer threatens b with dismissal if b does not sell a a louis xvi chest of drawers b ultimately agrees to the sale two days later a receives a letter from b announcing bs resignation and stating that b has sold the chest of drawers to c bs letter is sufficient notice of avoidance of the contract of sale with a 3 notice must be received the notice of avoidance becomes effective when it reaches the other party see article 1102 art 3213 unidroit principles 116 article 3212 time limits 1 notice of avoidance shall be given within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances after the avoiding party knew or could not have been unaware of the relevant facts or became capable of acting freely 2 where an individual term of the contract may be avoided by a party under article 327 the period of time for giving notice of avoidance begins to run when that term is asserted by the other party comment according to paragraph 1 of this article notice of avoidance must be given within a reasonable time after the avoiding party became aware or could not have been unaware of the relevant facts or became capable of acting freely more precisely the mistaken or defrauded party must give notice of avoidance within a reasonable time after it became aware or could no longer be unaware of the mistake or fraud the same applies in cases of gross disparity which result from an abuse of the innocent partys ignorance improvidence or inexperience in cases of threat or abuse of the innocent partys dependence economic distress or urgent needs the period runs from the time the threatened or abused party becomes capable of acting freely in case of avoidance of an individual term of the contract in accordance with article 327 paragraph 2 of this article states that the period of time for giving notice begins to run when that term is asserted by the party article 3213 partial avoidance where a ground of avoidance affects only individual terms of the contract the effect of avoidance is limited to those terms unless having regard to the circumstances it is unreasonable to uphold the remaining contract grounds for avoidance art 3214 117 comment this article deals with situations where the grounds of avoidance affect only individual terms of the contract in such cases the effects of avoidance will be limited to the terms affected unless it would in the circumstances be unreasonable to uphold the remaining contract this will generally depend upon whether or not a party would have entered into the contract had it envisaged that the terms in question would have been affected by grounds of avoidance i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a contractor agrees to build two houses on plots of land x and y for b one of which b intends to live in and the other to let b was mistaken in assuming that it had a licence to build on both plots since in fact the licence covered only plot x unless the circumstances indicate otherwise notwithstanding the avoidance of the contract concerning the building of the house on plot y it would be reasonable to uphold the remaining contract concerning the building of the house on plot x 2 the situation is the same as in illustration 1 except that a school was to be built on plot x and living quarters for the students on plot y unless the circumstances indicate otherwise after the avoidance of the contract concerning the building of the living quarters on plot y it would not be reasonable to uphold the remaining contract for the building of the school on plot x article 3214 retroactive effect of avoidance avoidance takes effect retroactively comment this article states the rule that avoidance takes effect retroactively in other words the contract is considered never to have existed in the case of a partial avoidance under article 3213 the rule applies only to the avoided part of the contract there are however individual terms of the contract which may survive even in cases of total avoidance arbitration jurisdiction and choiceoflaw clauses are considered to be different from the other terms of the contract and may be upheld notwithstanding the avoidance of the contract in whole or in part whether in fact such clauses remain operative is to be determined by the applicable domestic law art 3215 unidroit principles 118 article 3215 restitution 1 on avoidance either party may claim restitution of whatever it has supplied under the contract or the part of it avoided provided that such party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received under the contract or the part of it avoided 2 if restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable 3 the recipient of the performance does not have to make an allowance in money if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attributable to the other party 4 compensation may be claimed for expenses reasonably required to preserve or maintain the performance received comment 1 right of parties to restitution on avoidance according to paragraph 1 of this article either party may claim restitution of what the party has supplied under the contract or the part of it avoided the only condition is that each party makes restitution of whatever the party has received under the contract or the part of it avoided i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 in the process of a takeover of a company the controlling shareholder a agrees to sell and transfer to b shares for gbp 100000 after discovering that a had fraudulently misstated the profits the company was earning b avoids the contract b can claim back the purchase price of gbp 100000 at the same time b has to return the shares received from a as regards the costs involved in making restitution article 6111 applies grounds for avoidance art 3215 119 2 restitution in kind not possible or appropriate restitution must normally be in kind there are however instances where instead of restitution in kind an allowance in money has to be made this is the case first of all where restitution in kind is not possible the allowance will normally amount to the value of the performance received i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a commissions b to paint as factory b had fraudulently induced a to conclude the contract at a price that is much higher than the market price after having discovered the fraud a avoids the contract a can reclaim the purchase price from b while a is itself under a duty to pay for the value of having had its factory painted an allowance is further envisaged by paragraph 2 of this article whenever restitution in kind would not be appropriate this is so in particular when returning the performance in kind would cause unreasonable effort or expense the standard in that respect is the same as under article 722b i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 antiquarian a fraudulently induces antiquarian b to buy a collection of gold coins the gold coins are reloaded onto one of bs ships in a heavy storm the ship sinks b subsequently discovers the fraud and avoids the contract b can recover the price that it has paid while itself having to make an allowance representing the value of the gold coins this is in view of the fact that recovery of the gold coins from the sunken ship would involve expenses vastly exceeding their value the purpose of specifying that an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable is to make it clear that an allowance only has to be made if and to the extent that the performance received constitutes a benefit for the recipient i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a has undertaken to decorate the entrance hall of bs business centre after a has completed about half of the decorations b discovers that a is not the wellknown decorator a has pretended to be b avoids the contract since the decorations so far made cannot be returned and if they have no value for b a is not entitled to any allowance for the work done art 3215 unidroit principles 120 3 the allocation of risk the rule contained in paragraph 2 implies an allocation of risk it imposes a liability on the recipient of the performance to make good the value of that performance if it is unable to make restitution in kind the rule in paragraph 2 applies irrespective of whether the recipient was responsible for the deterioration or destruction of what it had received this allocation of the risk of deterioration or destruction is justified in particular because the risk should lie with the person in control of the performance on the contrary there is no liability to make good the value if the deterioration or destruction is attributable to the other party either because it was due to the other partys fault or because it was due to a defect inherent in the performance hence the rule in paragraph 3 i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 art dealer a buys from art dealer b a painting which both of them believe to be a genuine constable subsequently doubts arise about the authenticity of the painting b undertakes to obtain an expert opinion by the wellknown expert c c confirms that the painting actually is from a much less wellknown painter living at the time of constable due to bs negligence the painting is destroyed on the way back from c to a a avoids the contract on the ground of a relevant mistake under article 322 a can claim back the purchase price but does not have to make an allowance for the value of the painting the recipients liability to pay the value of the performance received is not excluded in cases where the deterioration or destruction would also have occurred had the performance not been rendered i l l u s t r a t i o n 6 company a sells and transfers earthmoving equipment to company b the equipment is subsequently destroyed by a hurricane that floods the properties of both a and b b avoids the contract because of a relevant mistake under article 322 b can reclaim the purchase price but at the same time b has to make an allowance for the value of the earthmoving equipment nor is the recipients liability to make good the value of the performance excluded in cases where it has been led to conclude the contract by the other partys fraudulent representation grounds for avoidance art 3215 121 i l l u s t r a t i o n 7 antique dealer a has fraudulently induced garage owner b to swap as ramshackle car against a valuable ancient greek vase belonging to b the car is accidentally destroyed while standing in bs garage if b avoids the contract under article 325 b can claim the vase back but has to make good the value of the car while article 325 is intended to make sure that b is not bound by the contract that it has entered into hence the right of avoidance and that b is not saddled with the consequences of a bad bargain that a has induced b to make hence the right to restitution article 325 does not protect b against accidents the question of the recipients liability to pay the value of the performance only arises in cases where the deterioration or destruction occurs before avoidance of the contract if what has been performed deteriorates or is destroyed after avoidance of the contract the recipient of the performance is under a duty to return what the recipient has received any nonperformance of that duty gives the other party a right to claim damages according to article 741 unless the nonperformance is excused under article 717 i l l u s t r a t i o n 8 art dealer a buys from art dealer b a painting which both parties believe to be a genuine constable after it has become apparent that the painting actually is from a much less wellknown painter living at the time of constable a avoids the contract on the ground of a relevant mistake under article 322 as a result a can reclaim the purchase price but is under a duty to return the painting before a can return the painting it is stolen by burglars whether b can claim damages depends on whether the burglary can be regarded as force majeure see article 717 4 compensation for expenses if the recipient of a performance has incurred expenses for the preservation or maintenance of the object of the performance it is reasonable to allow the recipient to claim compensation for these expenses in cases where the contract has been avoided and where therefore the parties have to return what they have received art 3216 unidroit principles 122 i l l u s t r a t i o n 9 company a has sold and delivered a race horse to company b after some time b realises that a has fraudulently concealed from him the true parentage of that horse b avoids the contract b can claim compensation for the costs incurred in feeding and caring for the horse this rule applies only to reasonable expenses what is reasonable depends on the circumstances of the case in illustration 9 it would matter whether the horse had been sold as a race horse or as an ordinary farm horse compensation cannot be claimed for expenses which are not required to preserve or maintain the performance received even if they are reasonable i l l u s t r a t i o n 10 company a has sold and delivered a software package to company b which both parties believe to possess a certain functionality when b discovers that this is not the case b asks c to check whether that functionality can still be implemented since that turns out not to be possible b avoids the contract for relevant mistake under article 322 b cannot recover from a the fee paid to c as expenses under paragraph 4 5 benefits the principles do not take a position concerning benefits that have been derived from the performance or interest that has been earned in commercial practice it will often be difficult to establish the value of the benefits received by the parties as a result of the performance furthermore often both parties will have received such benefits article 3216 damages irrespective of whether or not the contract has been avoided the party who knew or ought to have known of the ground for avoidance is liable for damages so as to put the other party in the same position in which it would have been if it had not concluded the contract grounds for avoidance art 3217 123 comment 1 damages if ground for avoidance known to the other party this article provides that a party which knew or ought to have known of a ground for avoidance is liable for damages to the other party the right to damages arises irrespective of whether or not the contract has been avoided 2 the measure of damages unlike the damages in case of nonperformance under chapter 7 section 4 the damages contemplated by this article are intended simply to put the other party in the position it would have been in if it had not concluded the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n company a sells software to company b and could not have been unaware of bs mistake as to its appropriateness for the use intended by b irrespective of whether or not b avoids the contract a is liable to b for all the expenses incurred by b in training its personnel in the use of the software but not for the loss suffered by b as a consequence of the impossibility to use the software for the intended purpose article 3217 unilateral declarations the provisions of this chapter apply with appropriate adaptations to any communication of intention addressed by one party to the other comment this article takes account of the fact that apart from the contract itself the parties either before or after the conclusion of the contract often exchange a number of communications of intention which may likewise be affected by invalidity in a commercial setting the most important example of unilateral communications of intention that are external but preparatory to a contract are bids for investment works delivery of goods or provision art 3217 unidroit principles 124 of services communications of intention made after the conclusion of a contract take a variety of forms such as notices declarations demands and requests in particular waivers and declarations by which a party assumes an obligation may be affected by a defect of consent 125 section 3 illegality article 331 contracts infringing mandatory rules 1 where a contract infringes a man datory rule whether of national international or supranational origin applicable under article 14 of these principles the effects of that infrin gement upon the contract are the effects if any expressly prescribed by that mandatory rule 2 where the mandatory rule does not expressly prescribe the effects of an infringement upon a contract the parties have the right to exercise such remedies under the contract as in the circumstances are reasonable 3 in determining what is reasonable regard is to be had in particular to a the purpose of the rule which has been infringed b the category of persons for whose protection the rule exists c any sanction that may be imposed under the rule infringed d the seriousness of the infringement e whether one or both parties knew or ought to have known of the infringement f whether the performance of the contract necessitates the infringement and g the parties reasonable expectations comment 1 scope of the section despite its paramount importance see article 11 under the principles freedom of contract is not without limit not only must parties conclude the contract without error and without constraints also the contract must not violate the applicable mandatory rules while defects of consent are dealt with in section 2 of this chapter this section is concerned with a contract that infringes mandatory rules art 331 unidroit principles 126 whether by its terms performance purpose or otherwise more precisely this section deals with the effects of that infringement on the contract by laying down the criteria to be followed in determining whether despite the infringement parties may still be granted remedies and if so whether there will be remedies under the contract article 331 or restitution article 332 2 only mandatory rules applicable under article 14 relevant for the purpose of this section only mandatory rules whether of national international or supranational origin that are applicable under article 14 are relevant see comments 1 and 2 on article 14 in other words this section is concerned only with a contract infringing mandatory rules be they specific statutory provisions or unwritten general principles of public policy which are applicable in accordance with the relevant rules of private international law which mandatory rules will be applicable in a given case basically depends on whether the dispute is pending before a domestic court or an arbitral tribunal and on whether the parties reference to the principles is considered to be only an agreement to incorporate them in the contract or whether the principles are applied as the law governing the contract see comments 3 4 and 5 on article 14 note that the illustrations below do not address these questions and are based on the assumption that the mandatory rules referred to apply in the cases illustrated 3 ways in which a contract may infringe mandatory rules a contract may infringe mandatory rules first of all by its very terms as shown by the following illustrations concerning corruption and collusive bidding mandatory rules may be specific statutory provisions or unwritten general principles of public policy i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 contractor a of country x enters into an agreement with agent b the commission agreement under which b for a fee of usd 1000000 would pay usd 10000000 to c a high ranking procurement advisor of d the minister of economics and development of country y in order to induce d to award a the contract for the construction of a new power plant in country y the contract in both countries x and y bribery of public officials is prohibited by statute the commission agreement infringes the statutory prohibitions in question by its terms as to the contract for the construction of the power plant see illustration 7 illegality art 331 127 2 contractor a of country x enters into an agreement with agent b the commission agreement to pay eur 100000 to c a high ranking officer of company d of country y in order to induce d to award a the contract for the installation of a sophisticated it system neither in country x nor in country y is bribery in the private sector prohibited by statute but in both countries it is considered contrary to public policy the commission agreement violates these principles of public policy by its terms 3 bidders a and b of countries x and y respectively enter into an agreement the collusive bidding agreement according to which in a series of public tendering proceedings for the procurement of construction contracts in country z they would collude so that a would get some of the contracts and b the others a statutory regulation of country z prohibits collusive bidding in public tendering proceedings the collusive bidding agreement infringes the statutory prohibition by its terms 4 bidders a and b of countries x and y respectively enter into an agreement the collusive bidding agreement according to which in a series of public tendering proceedings for the procurement of construction contracts in country z they would collude so that a would get some of the contracts and b the others in country z there is no statutory regulation prohibiting collusive bidding in public tendering proceedings but collusive bidding is considered contrary to public policy the collusive bidding agreement violates this principle of public policy by its terms a contract may also by its performance infringe mandatory rules i l l u s t r a t i o n s 5 a a largescale retailer in country x enters into an agreement with b a manufacturer in country y for the manufacture of toys according to its specifications the manufacture agreement a knew or ought to have known that the toys ordered would be manufactured by child labourers in both country x and country y child labour is considered contrary to public policy the manufacture agreement violates these principles of public policy by its performance 6 importer a from country x enters into an agreement with exporter b from country y for the supply of equipment after the conclusion of the contract the united nations imposes an embargo on the importation of such type of equipment into country x b nevertheless delivers the equipment in violation of the embargo the agreement between a and b violates the embargo by its performance art 331 unidroit principles 128 moreover a contract may also infringe mandatory rules in other ways for example by the way in which it is formed or by its purpose i l l u s t r a t i o n s 7 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b pays c the usd 10000000 bribe and d awards the contract to a the contract violates the statutes prohibiting corruption by the way in which it is formed 8 a a manufacturer of plastic explosives situated in country x enters into an agreement with b a trading company situated in country y for the supply of quantities of semtex a material useful for peaceful purposes as well as for the manufacture of bombs the supply agreement a knew or ought to have known that b would ultimately forward the goods to a terrorist organisation the supply agreement violates the fundamental principle of public policy prohibiting the support of terrorist activities by its purpose 4 effects of infringement expressly prescribed by the mandatory rule infringed sometimes the mandatory rule itself expressly states which contractual or restitutionary remedies if any are available to the parties in case of its infringement thus for instance article 1012 of the treaty on the european union former article 852 of the treaty of rome expressly states that anticompetitive agreements between enterprises which may affect trade between member states of the european union prohibited under article 1011 shall be automatically void similarly the unidroit convention on stolen or illegally exported cultural objects provides that a contracting state may request the return of a cultural object illegally exported from the territory of the requesting state article 5 and that the possessor of a cultural object who acquired the object illegally exported shall be entitled to payment by the requesting state of fair and reasonable compensation provided that it neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally exported article 6 5 effects of infringement to be determined according to what is reasonable in the circumstances if the mandatory rule does not expressly provide for the effects of its infringement upon the contract paragraph 2 provides that the parties may exercise such remedies under the contract as in the circumstances are reasonable the formula used is sufficiently broad to permit a illegality art 331 129 maximum of flexibility thus notwithstanding the infringement of the mandatory rule one or both of the parties may depending on the circumstances of the case be granted the ordinary remedies available under a valid contract including the right to performance or other remedies such as the right to treat the contract as being of no effect the adaptation of the contract or its termination on terms to be fixed the latter kind of remedies may be particularly appropriate where as a consequence of the infringement only part of the contract becomes ineffective as to the granting of restitution of the performances rendered under a contract infringing a mandatory rule see article 332 6 criteria for determining what is reasonable in the circumstances given the great variety of mandatory rules which may be relevant under this article ranging from regulations of a merely technical nature to prohibitions for the purpose of preventing grave social harm paragraph 3 provides a list of criteria to determine the contractual remedies available in the circumstances if any the list is not exhaustive in many cases more than one of the criteria will be relevant and the decision will involve a weighing of these criteria a purpose of the rule infringed among the most important factors to be taken into consideration is the purpose of the mandatory rule and whether the attaining of its purpose would or would not be affected by granting at least one of the parties a remedy under the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n s 9 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that even though b paid c as bribe d does not award the contract to a since the purpose of the relevant statutory prohibition of bribery would be frustrated by granting a and b any remedy under the commission agreement b may not request the payment of the usd 1000000 fee from a nor may a recover from b the usd 10000000 b has paid to c 10 a an aircraft manufacturer in country x knowing that c the ministry of defence of country y intends to purchase a number of military aircraft enters into an agreement with b a consultancy firm located in country y by which b is to negotiate the possible purchase by c of the aircraft manufactured by a the agency agreement a statutory regulation of country y prohibits the employment of intermediaries in the negotiation and conclusion of contracts with governmental agencies since the purpose of the statutory prohibition of the employment of intermediaries is to fight art 331 unidroit principles 130 corruption neither a nor b should be granted any remedy under the agency agreement 11 the facts are the same as in illustration 6 since the purpose of the embargo is to impose a sanction on country x following xs violation of international law the attaining of that purpose requires that all contracts concluded or performed in violation of the embargo have no effect and that parties be denied any remedy under such contracts b category of persons to be protected by the rule infringed another important factor to be taken into consideration is whether the mandatory rule that is infringed is aimed at protecting the interests of the public in general or those of a specific category of persons licensing requirements are often of the latter type ie are imposed by law on those carrying out certain activities for the protection of their customers or clients if a contract is entered into by an unlicensed party it might be reasonable to grant its customer or client at least some remedies under the contract such as damages i l l u s t r a t i o n 12 company a in country x enters into an agreement with engineer b in country y for the preparation of plans for the restructuring of as factory the engineering contract a statutory regulation of country x requires that only licensed engineers carry out this activity b who does not have the necessary license delivers plans that are in part based on erroneous calculations causing a delay in the restructuring work requested by a to pay damages for the loss caused by the delay b refuses to pay on the ground that the engineering contract was invalid as b lacked the required license since the purpose of the license requirement is the protection of the clients a may be granted the right to damages c any sanction that may be imposed under the rule infringed statutory regulations prohibiting certain activities or imposing limitations to certain activities often provide criminal or administrative sanctions as noted in comment 4 when such a regulation expressly states the effect of violation on contractual rights or remedies that statement controls when the regulation is silent as to that effect however the existence and nature of the criminal or administrative sanctions can provide important insight into the purpose of the rule that has been violated the category of persons for whose protection the rule exists and the seriousness of the violation accordingly the existence and nature of these sanctions should be taken into consideration in illegality art 331 131 determining the effect of such a violation on contractual rights and remedies i l l u s t r a t i o n 13 a an exporter in country x enters into a contract of carriage with b a shipowner in country y to carry goods by sea from country x to country y the contract a statutory regulation in country x imposes limits on the loads that ships may carry the statutory regulation provides for a fine in the case of its violation but it says nothing about the effects a violation would have on the individual contracts of carriage b overloads the ship and a claiming the invalidity of the contract refuses to pay the freight notwithstanding the fact that the goods had arrived safely since the purpose of the statutory regulation is to prevent in the interests of the safety of the ship and its crew overloading and not to prohibit contracts and this purpose is sufficiently achieved by the fining of b b may be granted the right to be paid the agreed freight for the carriage of the goods d seriousness of infringement another factor to be taken into consideration is the seriousness of the infringement thus remedies under the contract may be granted where the mandatory rule is of a purely technical nature and its infringement has no impact on the other party i l l u s t r a t i o n s 14 cattle farmer a in country x sells cattle to cattle farmer b in country y a statutory regulation in country y requires incoming cattle to be properly tagged and that the information contained on the tags also be set out in accompanying documents the cattle delivered is properly tagged but the accompanying documents are incomplete a may nevertheless be granted the right to payment of the price 15 a an exporter in country x enters into a contract with b a carrier from country y for the carriage of dangerous goods from country x to country y the contract country x has a statutory regulation requiring goods of the kind in question to be carried on a vehicle with particular safety requirements the statutory regulation provides a criminal sanction in case of violation but says nothing about the effects a violation would have on the individual contracts of carriage b carries the goods on a vehicle that does not meet the prescribed safety requirements a claiming the invalidity of the contract refuses to pay the freight notwithstanding the fact that the goods arrived safely since the purpose of the statutory regulations is the prevention of injury to third persons or damage to the art 331 unidroit principles 132 environment b irrespective of the imposition of the criminal sanction should not be granted the right to be paid the agreed freight e whether one or both parties knew or ought to have known of the infringement granting remedies under the contract may also depend on whether one or even both of the parties knew or ought to have known of the mandatory rule or of its infringement i l l u s t r a t i o n s 16 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b has paid the bribe to c and d who neither knew nor ought to have known of the bribe to c awarded the contract to a if d subsequently becomes aware of the payment of the bribe d may choose whether or not to treat the contract as effective if d chooses to treat the contract as effective a will be obliged to perform and d will have to pay the price subject to an appropriate adjustment taking into consideration the payment of the bribe if on the other hand d chooses to treat the contract as being of no effect neither of the parties has a remedy under the contract this is without prejudice to any restitutionary remedy that may exist 17 contractor a of country x enters into negotiations with d the minister of economics and development of country y with a view to conclude an agreement on a large infrastructure project the contract d requests the payment of a commission of 75 of the contract price in order to conclude the contract a pays the requested commission and the contract is concluded when a has already performed half of its obligations under the contract a new government comes to power in country y and the new minister of economics and development invoking the payment of the commission cancels the project and refuses to pay for the work already performed a is not entitled to any remedy under the contract this is without prejudice to any restitutionary remedy that may exist f whether the performance of the contract necessitates the infringement another factor to be taken into consideration is whether the performance of the contract necessitates the infringement thus if by its very terms the contract provides for or even only implicitly involves the violation of a statutory regulation it might be reasonable not to grant the parties any remedy under the contract illegality art 331 133 i l l u s t r a t i o n 18 company a of country x enters into a contract with company b of country y for the construction of a chemical fertiliser production plant in country y the contract the contract does not provide for the installation of the safety devices required by the environmental protection laws of country y and the parties deliberately agree on a price insufficient to cover the costs of the installation of the devices in question neither a nor b should be granted any remedy under the contract g the parties reasonable expectations if one of the parties on account of different legal or commercial culture could not have reasonably been aware of the infringement or as is more often the case one of the parties creates a legitimate expectation as to the enforceability of the contract or its individual terms and later invokes a statutory prohibition of its own law in order to nullify that expectation it might be reasonable to grant the other party the remedies available under the contract or its individual terms i l l u s t r a t i o n 19 company a of country x enters into an agreement with b the minister of economics and development of country y concerning an investment project in country y the agreement the agreement contains a clause providing that all disputes arising out of the agreement should be decided by arbitration to be held in country z in accordance with the uncitral arbitration rules if a dispute subsequently arises and a commences arbitration proceedings b with a view to avoiding arbitration cannot invoke a mandatory rule of country y according to which the domestic courts of country y have exclusive jurisdiction which may not be contractually excluded by an arbitration agreement for disputes relating to contracts of the type of the agreement h other criteria in addition to the criteria expressly listed in paragraph 3 of this article there are others which may be taken into consideration to determine the remedies available in the circumstances if any one criterion is the extent to which the contract infringes the mandatory rule if the contract infringes the mandatory rule only in part it may be reasonable to adapt the contract and grant the parties remedies under it art 332 unidroit principles 134 i l l u s t r a t i o n 20 the facts are the same as in illustration 5 except that only one specific type of toy ordered by a is manufactured by child labourers in their homes while all the other types are manufactured by workers lawfully employed by b in its factory under the circumstances it may be reasonable to adapt the manufacture agreement accordingly and grant the parties the ordinary remedies under the adapted manufacture agreement another factor is the timely withdrawal from the improper transaction thus if a party to a contract infringing a mandatory rule repents of its action before the unlawful purpose of the contract has been achieved that party may be granted the right to recover what it has performed i l l u s t r a t i o n 21 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that a after having paid b the agreed fee of usd 1000000 but before b pays c the usd 10000000 bribe decides no longer to pursue the illegal purpose and withdraws from the contract a may be granted the right to recover the fee from b article 332 restitution 1 where there has been performance under a contract infringing a mandatory rule under article 331 restitution may be granted where this would be reasonable in the circum stances 2 in determining what is reasonable regard is to be had with the appropriate adaptations to the criteria referred to in article 3313 3 if restitution is granted the rules set out in article 3215 apply with appropriate adaptations illegality art 332 135 comment 1 restitution under contracts infringing mandatory rules to be granted where reasonable under the circumstances even where as a consequence of the infringement of a mandatory rule the parties are denied any remedies under the contract it remains to be seen whether they may at least claim restitution of what they have rendered in performing the contract according to article 3311 the answer first of all depends on the mandatory rule itself which may or may not expressly address the issue see also comment 4 on article 331 if the mandatory rule is silent on the issue this article in line with the modern trend adopts a flexible approach and provides that where there has been performance under a contract infringing a mandatory rule restitution may be granted if this would be reasonable in the circumstances paragraph 1 in other words contrary to the traditional view that at least where both parties were aware or ought to have been aware of the infringement of the mandatory rule they should be left where they stand ie should not even be entitled to recover the benefits conferred under the principles restitution may or may not be granted depending on whether it is more appropriate to allow the recipient to keep what it has received or to allow the performer to reclaim it 2 criteria for determining whether granting of restitution reasonable the same criteria laid down in paragraph 3 of article 331 to determine if any contractual remedies are available in the circumstances if any apply to determine whether granting restitution under paragraph 1 of this article is reasonable however since the contractual and restitutionary remedies are different the same criteria may lead to different results under the same facts i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 in the comments on article 331 except that a having been awarded the contract had almost completed the construction of the power plant when in country y a new government comes to power which claims that the contract is invalid because of corruption and refuses to pay the outstanding 50 of the price under the circumstances it would not be fair to let d have the almost completed power plant for half the agreed price a may be granted an allowance in money for the work done corresponding to the value that the almost completed power art 332 unidroit principles 136 plant has for d and d may be granted restitution of any payment it has made exceeding this amount 2 contractor a of country x enters into negotiations with d the minister of economics and development of country y with a view of concluding an agreement on a large infrastructure project the contract d requests the payment of a commission of 75 of the contract price in order to conclude the contract a pays the requested commission and the contract is concluded after a has fulfilled all of its obligations under the contract a new government comes to power in country y and the new minister of economics and development invoking the payment of the commission refuses to pay the remaining contract price a may be granted an allowance in money for the work done corresponding to the value of the infrastructure project 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 15 in the comments on article 331 except that b given that the goods had arrived safely at destination claims the recovery of at least the value of its service under the circumstances ie in view of the seriousness of the violation and the necessity of preventing by all means the carriage of dangerous goods by vehicles lacking the required safety requirements b may not even be granted the right to recover the value of its service 3 rules governing restitution if granted if restitution is granted under this article it is governed by the rules set out in article 3215 on restitution in the context of avoidance these rules however need some adaptations in the sense that in paragraph 1 of article 3215 the reference to avoidance is to be understood as a reference to the case where the contract becomes ineffective as a result of the infringement of a mandatory rule and the reference to avoidance of part of the contract as a reference to the case where only part of the contract becomes ineffective as a result of the infringement of a mandatory rule for further explanation of the rules on restitution referred to in this article see the comments on article 3215 137 chapter 4 interpretation article 41 intention of the parties 1 a contract shall be interpreted according to the common intention of the parties 2 if such an intention cannot be established the contract shall be interpreted according to the meaning that reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties would give to it in the same circumstances comment 1 common intention of the parties to prevail paragraph 1 of this article lays down the principle that in determining the meaning to be attached to the terms of a contract preference is to be given to the intention common to the parties in consequence a contract term may be given a meaning which differs both from the literal sense of the language used and from the meaning which a reasonable person would attach to it provided that such a different understanding was common to the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract the practical importance of the principle should not be over estimated firstly because parties to commercial transactions are unlikely to use language in a sense entirely different from that usually attached to it and secondly because even if this were to be the case it would be extremely difficult once a dispute arises to prove that a particular meaning which one of the parties claims to have been their common intention was in fact shared by the other party at the time of the conclusion of the contract art 42 unidroit principles 138 2 recourse to the understanding of reasonable persons for those cases where the common intention of the parties cannot be established paragraph 2 provides that the contract shall be interpreted in accordance with the meaning which reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties would give to it in the same circumstances the test is not a general and abstract criterion of reasonableness but rather the understanding which could reasonably be expected of persons with for example the same linguistic knowledge technical skill or business experience as the parties 3 how to establish the common intention of the parties or to determine the understanding of reasonable persons in order to establish whether the parties had a common intention and if so what that common intention was regard is to be had to all the relevant circumstances of the case the most important of which are listed in article 43 the same applies to the determination of the understanding of reasonable persons when no common intention of the parties can be established 4 interpretation of standard terms both the subjective test laid down in paragraph 1 and the reasonableness test in paragraph 2 may not always be appropriate in the context of standard terms indeed given their special nature and purpose standard terms should be interpreted primarily in accordance with the reasonable expectations of their average users irrespective of the actual understanding which either of the parties to the contract concerned or reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties might have had for the definition of standard terms see article 21192 article 42 interpretation of statements and other conduct 1 the statements and other conduct of a party shall be interpreted according to that partys intention if the other party knew or could not have been unaware of that intention interpretation art 42 139 2 if the preceding paragraph is not applicable such statements and other conduct shall be interpreted according to the meaning that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would give to it in the same circumstances comment 1 interpretation of unilateral acts by analogy to the criteria laid down in article 41 with respect to the contract as a whole this article states that in the interpretation of unilateral statements or conduct preference is to be given to the intention of the party concerned provided that the other party knew or could not have been unaware of that intention and that in all other cases such statements or conduct are to be interpreted according to the understanding that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would have had in the same circumstances in practice the principal field of application of this article which corresponds almost literally to article 81 and 2 cisg will be in the process of the formation of contracts where parties make statements and engage in conduct the precise legal significance of which may have to be established in order to determine whether or not a contract is ultimately concluded there are however also unilateral acts performed after the conclusion of the contract which may give rise to problems of interpretation for example a notification of defects in goods notice of avoidance or of termination of the contract etc 2 how to establish the intention of the party performing the act or to determine the understanding of a reasonable person in applying both the subjective test laid down in paragraph 1 and the reasonableness test in paragraph 2 regard is to be had to all the relevant circumstances the most important of which are listed in article 43 art 43 unidroit principles 140 article 43 relevant circumstances in applying articles 41 and 42 regard shall be had to all the circumstances including a preliminary negotiations between the parties b practices which the parties have established between themselves c the conduct of the parties subsequent to the conclusion of the contract d the nature and purpose of the contract e the meaning commonly given to terms and expressions in the trade concerned f usages comment 1 circumstances relevant in the interpretation process this article indicates circumstances which have to be taken into consideration when applying both the subjective test and the reasonableness test in articles 41 and 42 the list mentions only those circumstances which are the most important and is in no way intended to be exhaustive 2 particular and general circumstances compared of the circumstances listed in this article some relate to the particular relationship which exists between the parties concerned while others are of a more general character although in principle all the circumstances listed may be relevant in a given case the first three are likely to have greater weight in the application of the subjective test i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a contract for the writing of a book between a and b a publisher indicates that the book should consist of about 300 pages during their negotiations b had assured a that an approximate indication of the number of pages was necessary for administrative reasons and that a was not bound to stick precisely to that number of pages but could exceed it substantially if need interpretation art 43 141 be a submits a manuscript of 500 pages in interpreting the meaning of about 300 pages due consideration should be given to these preliminary negotiations see article 43a 2 a a canadian manufacturer and b a united states retailer conclude a number of contracts for the delivery of optical lenses in which the price is always expressed in canadian dollars a makes b a new offer indicating the price in dollars without further specification but intending to refer again to canadian dollars in the absence of any indication to the contrary as intention will prevail see article 43b the remaining circumstances listed in this article ie the nature and purpose of the contract the meaning commonly given to terms and expressions in the trade concerned and usages are important primarily although not exclusively in the application of the reasonableness test the criteria in subparagraphs e and f may at first sight appear to overlap there is however a difference between them while the usages apply only if they meet the requirements laid down in article 19 the meaning commonly given in the trade concerned can be relevant even if it is peculiar to a trade sector to which only one or even neither party belongs provided that the expression or term concerned is one which is typical in that trade sector i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 a and b conclude a contract for the sale of a cargo of oil at usd 80 per barrel the parties subsequently disagree on the size of the barrel to which they had referred a having intended a barrel of 42 standard gallons and b one of 36 imperial gallons in the absence of any indications to the contrary as understanding prevails since in the international oil trade it is a usage to measure barrels in standard gallons see article 43f 4 a a shipowner concludes a charterparty agreement with b for the carriage of grain containing the standard term whether in berth or not with respect to the commencement of the laytime of the ship after its reaching the port of destination when it subsequently emerges that the parties attached different meanings to the term preference should in the absence of any indication to the contrary be given to the meaning commonly attached to it in the shipping trade since the term is typical in the shipping trade see article 43e art 43 unidroit principles 142 3 practices established between parties and conduct subsequent to the conclusion of the contract relevant particularly in interpretation of longterm contracts conduct subsequent to the conclusion of the contract can assist in determining what the parties intended their obligations to be this may be the case particularly in the context of longterm contracts which involve complex performance and are evolutionary in nature ie may require adaptations in the course of performance such contracts may involve repeated performance by one party with the opportunity for the other to assert that such performance does not conform to the contract as a rule the subsequent conduct of the parties can only be an interpretative tool ie be used to explain or amplify but not to contradict the terms of the contract as originally agreed between the parties i l l u s t r a t i o n s 5 supplier a enters into a fiveyear contract with shopping mall b to supply bs need for salt to clear ice in its parking lot and on its sidewalks for the first two winters a provides an icemelting substance which is not a salt with no objection being raised by b at the start of the next winter b objects that the substance is not a salt as stated in the contract the fact that for two winters both a and b performed as though the supplied substance satisfied the contract permits the inference that the parties intended the contracts reference to salt to include such an icemelting substance 6 contractor a agrees to provide client b with concrete slabs of a particular thickness in a building at a unit price of x without specifying whether that price applies to a square metre of those slabs or cubic metres of concrete the parties perform over several months without any objection as though the unit price applied to square metres of slabs a dispute subsequently arises regarding the proper unit of measure the fact that for several months a and b had performed as though the proper unit of measure was square metres of slabs permits the inference that the parties intended that to be the proper unit of measure interpretation art 43 143 to avoid any uncertainty as to the effects of subsequent conduct on the content of the contract the parties may wish to adopt particular mechanisms for possible variations and adjustments of the contract in the course of performance they may for instance provide for the issuance of variation orders by one party for acceptance by the other party eg in construction contracts the employers representative and the contractors representative respectively or establish special bodies composed of representatives of both parties or of independent experts socalled contract management committees auditing bodies or the like with the task of monitoring both parties performance and possibly also of suggesting adjustments to the contract so as to bring it in line with developments obviously the more precisely the parties regulate the procedure for adjustments to the contract the less relevant any informal conduct of the parties would be to the interpretation of the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n s 7 a construction contract between employer a and contractor b provides that as representative has the authority to give instructions regarding additions omissions or other changes in work to be performed by b so long as those additions omissions or other changes fall within the overall scope of work under the contract b will be bound to perform them and they will have the effect of changing the relevant work provided for in the original contract 8 contractor a enters into a design build and operate dbo contract with company b to design and build a factory and operate it for twenty years the contract provides for the parties to appoint jointly an independent and impartial auditing body whose purpose is to audit and monitor the compliance of each of the parties with the operation management requirements set out in the contract the contract may also provide that if the auditing body determines that a party has failed to comply that party must take appropriate corrective action therefore if in a given case the auditing body determines that a has not complied with its obligations under the contract a is bound to take the appropriate action art 44 unidroit principles 144 4 merger and no oral modification clauses parties to international commercial transactions in general and to complex longterm contracts in particular frequently include a provision indicating that the contract document completely embodies the terms on which they have agreed socalled merger or entire agreement clauses and that any modification to the contract or specific terms of it must be made in writing socalled no oral modification clauses for the effect of the former type of clauses in particular whether and to what extent they exclude the relevance of preliminary negotiations between the parties albeit only for the purpose of the interpretation of the contract see article 2117 as to the latter type of clauses see article 2118 and the limitation of the rule therein contained by virtue of the principle of prohibition of inconsistent behaviour laid down in article 18 i l l u s t r a t i o n 9 manufacturer a enters into an agreement with distributor b for the distribution of its products in country x the agreement expressly states that the distributorship is nonexclusive and in fact in country x as products are distributed also by distributor c the agreement between a and b also contains a nooral modification clause according to which any modification of its terms has to be in writing and approved by as parent company subsequently c ceases its activity and b acts to as knowledge as though it has become the exclusive distributor of as products in country x by among others things holding itself out as such to cs clients without any reaction on the part of a when a replaces c with a new distributor b may not object that by their conduct a and b have modified their original agreement turning it into an exclusive agreement article 44 reference to contract or statement as a whole terms and expressions shall be interpreted in the light of the whole contract or statement in which they appear interpretation art 45 145 comment 1 interpretation in the light of the whole contract or statement terms and expressions used by one or both parties are clearly not intended to operate in isolation but have to be seen as an integral part of their general context consequently they should be interpreted in the light of the whole contract or statement in which they appear i l l u s t r a t i o n a a licensee hears that despite a provision in their contract granting a an exclusive licence b the licensor has concluded a similar contract with c one of as competitors a sends b a letter complaining of bs breach and ending with the words your behaviour has clearly demonstrated that it was a mistake on our part to rely on your professional correctness we hereby avoid the contract we have with you despite the use of the term avoid as words interpreted in the light of the letter as a whole must be understood as a notice of termination 2 in principle no hierarchy among contract terms in principle there is no hierarchy among contract terms in the sense that their respective importance for the interpretation of the remaining part of the contract is the same regardless of the order in which they appear there are however exceptions to this rule firstly declarations of intent made in the preamble may or may not be of relevance for the interpretation of the operative provisions of the contract secondly it goes without saying that in cases of conflict provisions of a specific character prevail over provisions laying down more general rules finally the parties may themselves expressly establish a hierarchy among the different provisions or parts of their contract this is frequently the case with complex agreements consisting of different documents relating to the legal economic and technical aspects of the transaction article 45 all terms to be given effect contract terms shall be interpreted so as to give effect to all the terms rather than to deprive some of them of effect art 46 unidroit principles 146 comment it is to be expected that when drafting their contract parties do not use words to no purpose it is for this reason that this article lays down the rule that unclear contract terms should be interpreted so as to give effect to all the terms rather than to deprive some of them of effect the rule however comes into play only if the terms in question remain unclear notwithstanding the application of the basic rules of interpretation laid down in articles 41 to 43 i l l u s t r a t i o n a a commercial television network enters into an agreement with b a film distributor for the periodic supply of a certain number of films to be transmitted on as network in the afternoon when only those films that are admissible for all viewers may be transmitted according to the contract the films submitted must have passed the admission test of the competent censorship commission a dispute arises between a and b as to the meaning of this term b maintains that it implies only that the films must have been released for circulation even if they are xrated while a insists that they must have been classified as admissible for everybody if it is not possible otherwise to establish the meaning to be attached to the term in question as understanding prevails since bs interpretation would deprive the provision of any effect article 46 contra proferentem rule if contract terms supplied by one party are unclear an interpretation against that party is preferred comment a party may be responsible for the formulation of a particular contract term either because that party has drafted it or otherwise supplied it for example by using standard terms prepared by others such a party should bear the risk of possible lack of clarity of the formulation chosen it is for this reason that this article states that if contract terms supplied by one party are unclear there is a preference for their interpretation against that party the extent to which this rule applies will depend on the circumstances of the case the less the interpretation art 47 147 contract term in question was the subject of further negotiations between the parties the greater the justification for interpreting it against the party who included it in the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n a contract between a a contractor and b for the construction of an industrial plant contains a provision drafted by a and not discussed further stating that the contractor shall be liable for and shall indemnify the purchaser for all losses expenses and claims in respect of any loss of or damage to physical property other than the works death or personal injury caused by negligence of the contractor its employees and agents one of as employees plays around with some of bs equipment after working hours and damages it a denies liability contending that the provision in question covers only cases where as employees act within the scope of their employment in the absence of any indication to the contrary the provision will be interpreted in the manner which is less favourable to a ie as also covering cases where its employees are not acting within the scope of their employment article 47 linguistic discrepancies where a contract is drawn up in two or more language versions which are equally authoritative there is in case of discrepancy between the versions a preference for the interpretation according to a version in which the contract was originally drawn up comment international commercial contracts are often drawn up in two or more language versions which may diverge on specific points sometimes the parties expressly indicate which version shall prevail if all versions are equally authoritative the question arises of how possible discrepancies should be dealt with this article does not lay down a hard and fast rule but merely indicates that preference should be given to the version in which the contract was originally drawn up or should it have been drawn up in more than one original language version to one of those versions art 48 unidroit principles 148 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a and b neither of them a native english speaker negotiate and draw up a contract in english before translating it into their respective languages the parties agree that all three versions are equally authoritative in case of divergences between the texts the english version will prevail unless circumstances indicate the contrary a situation where a different solution may be preferable could arise where the parties have contracted on the basis of internationally and widely known instruments such as incoterms or the uniform customs and practices on documentary credits in case of divergences between the different versions used by the parties it may be preferable to refer to yet another version if that version is much clearer than the ones used i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a contract between a company from country x and a company from country y drawn up in three equally authoritative versions the language of country x the language of country y and english contains a reference to incoterms 2010 if the french version of incoterms is much clearer than the other three on a point in dispute that version might be referred to article 48 supplying an omitted term 1 where the parties to a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is important for a determination of their rights and duties a term which is appropriate in the circumstances shall be supplied 2 in determining what is an appropriate term regard shall be had among other factors to a the intention of the parties b the nature and purpose of the contract c good faith and fair dealing d reasonableness interpretation art 48 149 comment 1 supplying of omitted terms and interpretation articles 41 to 47 deal with the interpretation of contracts in the strict sense ie with the determination of the meaning which should be given to contract terms which are unclear this article addresses a different though related issue namely that of the supplying of omitted terms omitted terms or gaps occur when after the conclusion of the contract a question arises which the parties have not regulated in their contract at all either because they preferred not to deal with it or simply because they did not foresee it however in other cases the parties may intentionally leave open terms with the terms to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the parties or by a third person this will occur with particular frequency in longterm contracts if the parties fail to agree or the party or third person fails to determine the term article 2114 applies 2 when omitted terms are to be supplied in many cases of omitted terms or gaps in the contract the principles will themselves provide a solution to the issue see for example articles 516 determination of quality of performance 517 price determination 611 time of performance 614 order of performance 616 place of performance and 6110 currency not expressed see also in general article 512 on implied obligations however even when there are such gapfilling solutions which may be generally applicable they may not apply in a given case particularly in longterm contracts because they would not provide a solution appropriate in the circumstances in view of the expectations of the parties or the special nature of the contract this article then applies without prejudice to the application of article 512 where appropriate 3 criteria for the supplying of omitted terms the terms supplied under this article must be appropriate to the circumstances of the case particularly in relation to longterm contracts in order to determine what is appropriate regard is first of all to be had to the intention of the parties as inferred from among other factors the terms expressly stated in the contract any preamble to the contract art 48 unidroit principles 150 prior negotiations or any conduct subsequent to the conclusion of the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 the parties to a construction contract agree on a special interest rate to be paid by the purchaser in the event of delay in payment of the price before the beginning of the work the parties decide to terminate the contract when the constructor delays restitution of the advance payment the question arises of the applicable interest rate in the absence of an express term in the contract dealing with this question the circumstances may make it appropriate to apply the special interest rate agreed for delay in payment of the price by the purchaser also to delay in restitution by the constructor if the intention of the parties cannot be ascertained the term to be supplied may be determined in accordance with the nature and purpose of the contract and the principles of good faith and fair dealing and reasonableness i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a distribution franchise agreement provides that the franchisee may not engage in any similar business for a year after the termination of the agreement although the agreement is silent on the territorial scope of this prohibition it is in view of the particular nature and purpose of the franchise agreement appropriate that the prohibition be restricted to the territory where the franchisee had exploited the franchise 151 chapter 5 content third party rights and conditions section 1 content article 511 express and implied obligations the contractual obligations of the parties may be express or implied comment this provision restates the widely accepted principle according to which the obligations of the parties are not necessarily limited to that which has been expressly stipulated in the contract other obligations may be implicit see article 512 comments and illustrations close links exist between this article and some of the other provisions of the principles thus article 511 is a direct corollary of the rule according to which each party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing in international trade article 17 insofar as the rules on interpretation chapter 4 provide criteria for filling lacunae besides criteria for solving ambiguities those rules may assist in determining the precise content of the contract and therefore in establishing the terms which must be considered as implied article 512 implied obligations implied obligations stem from a the nature and purpose of the contract b practices established between the parties and usages c good faith and fair dealing d reasonableness art 513 unidroit principles 152 comment this article describes the sources of implied obligations different reasons may account for the fact that they have not been expressly stated the implied obligations may for example have been so obvious given the nature or the purpose of the obligation that the parties felt that the obligations went without saying alternatively they may already have been included in the practices established between the parties or prescribed by trade usages according to article 19 yet again they may be a consequence of the principles of good faith and fair dealing and reasonableness in contractual relations i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a rents a full computer network to b and installs it the contract says nothing as to as possible obligation to give b at least some basic information concerning the operation of the system this may however be considered to be an implied obligation since it is obvious and necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose of such a contract that the provider of sophisticated goods should supply the other party with a minimum of information see article 512a 2 a broker who has negotiated a charterparty claims the commission due although the brokerage contract is silent as to the time when the commission is due the usages of the sector can provide an implied term according to which the commission is due for example only when the hire is earned or alternatively when the charterparty was signed regardless of whether or not the hire will effectively be paid see article 512b 3 a and b who have entered into the negotiation of a co operation agreement conclude an agreement concerning a complex feasibility study which will be most timeconsuming for a long before the study is completed b decides that it will not pursue the negotiation of the cooperation agreement even though nothing has been stipulated regarding such a situation good faith requires b to notify a of its decision without delay see article 512c article 513 cooperation between the parties each party shall cooperate with the other party when such cooperation may reasonably be expected for the performance of that partys obligations content art 513 153 comment 1 duty of cooperation as an application of the general principle of good faith and fair dealing a contract is not merely a meeting point for conflicting interests but must also to a certain extent be viewed as a common project in which each party must cooperate this view is clearly related to the principle of good faith and fair dealing see article 17 which permeates the law of contract as well as to the obligation to mitigate harm in the event of nonperformance see article 748 this article states the parties duty to cooperate with each other to the extent that such cooperation may reasonably be expected for the performance of their respective obligations instances of such duty are expressly or implicitly provided for in the principles either in the black letter rules see articles 533 712 and 748 or in the comments see eg comment 3 on article 616 comment 3a on article 6114 and comment 10 on article 714 however there are many other instances in which the parties may be requested to cooperate with each other in the course of contract formation or contract performance the duty of cooperation must of course be confined within certain limits ie it only exists to the extent that cooperation may reasonably be expected to enable the other party to perform without upsetting the allocation of duties in the contract within these limits each party may be under a duty not only to refrain from hindering the other party from performing its obligations but also to take affirmative steps to enable the other partys performance i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a an art gallery in country x buys a sixteenth century painting from b a private collector in country y the painting may not be exported without a special authorisation and the contract requires b to apply for that permission b who has no experience of such formalities encounters serious difficulties with the application whereas a is familiar with such procedures in these circumstances and notwithstanding the contractual provision a can be expected to give at least some assistance to b 2 company a and company b enter into a contract for the sale of electricity by a to b the contract is not performed by b prompting a to sue b for breach of contract and damages b objects that the contract is null and void for lack of registration in the public art 513 unidroit principles 154 registry according to the applicable law the registration of the contract is a joint task of the parties since b has not done what it was required to do in order to obtain the registration such registration could not be accomplished b is not entitled to rely on the lack of registration of the contract as a defence to as claim 3 seller a situated in country x concludes with buyer b situated in country y a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered in instalments after the discovery by b of alleged defects in part of the goods delivered a agrees to a price reduction and an extension of payment dates but in turn asks b promptly to submit a formal notice of the defects together with other documents a needs to explain to the export and exchange control authorities of its country the reasons for the reduced price and the extended dates of payment so as to avoid severe penalties since b only gradually and partially meets as requests a informs b that it will make the remaining deliveries conditional upon bs submission of the requested documents and the prompt payment of the goods already delivered b may not object that in so doing a was breaching the contract and the subsequent agreement on the extension of payment since it was b who with its obstructionist behaviour had failed to observe its general duty of cooperation under the contract 2 cooperation between parties in the context of longterm contracts although this article states the duty of cooperation in general terms for all types of contract in practice cooperation may be particularly important in the context of longterm contracts particularly contracts involving performance of a complex nature may especially need co operation throughout the life of the contract in order for the transaction to work although always within the limit of reasonable expectations thus by way of example in a contract for the construction of industrial works the employer may be required to prevent interferences in the contractors work by other contractors it employs to carry out other works at the site likewise in a distributorship agreement the supplier is under a duty to abstain from any conduct that might hinder the distributor from achieving the contractuallyagreed minimum of orders or in a franchising agreement the franchisor may be prevented from setting up a competing business in the immediate neighbourhood of the franchisees business even if the franchise is not exclusive obviously also in the context of longterm contracts the parties duty to cooperate exists only within the limit of reasonable expectations content art 514 155 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 contractor a is awarded by b a governmental agency in country x a contract to build a 3000 house complex in country x since it is a greenfield project electricity and water also have to be brought in and the respective works have to be executed in a certain sequence so as not to conflict with each other b awards the electrical contracts to local contractors but then completely fails to coordinate their work with as work with the result that a repeatedly has to interrupt its work thereby causing a considerable loss b is liable for this loss since in the circumstances it should have actively coordinated the work of the local contractors so that as work would not be interrupted in such manner 5 company a situated in country x and company b situated in country y enter into a joint venture agreement for participation in a public bidding procedure in country x the contract is finally awarded to a third party the procedure was manifestly improper but b refuses to provide a with information necessary to appeal the award before the competent authority thereby hindering a from pursuing the appeal by its refusal b has breached its general duty of cooperation to a under the joint venture agreement article 514 duty to achieve a specific result duty of best efforts 1 to the extent that an obligation of a party involves a duty to achieve a specific result that party is bound to achieve that result 2 to the extent that an obligation of a party involves a duty of best efforts in the performance of an activity that party is bound to make such efforts as would be made by a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances art 514 unidroit principles 156 comment 1 distinction between the duty to achieve a specific result and the duty of best efforts the degree of diligence required of a party in the performance of an obligation varies considerably depending upon the nature of the obligation incurred sometimes a party is bound only by a duty of best efforts that party must then exert the efforts that a reasonable person of the same kind would exert in the same circumstances but does not guarantee the achievement of a specific result in other cases however the obligation is more onerous and such a specific result is promised the distinction between a duty to achieve a specific result and a duty of best efforts corresponds to two frequent and typical degrees of severity in the assumption of a contractual obligation although it does not encompass all possible situations obligations of both types may coexist in the same contract for instance a firm that repairs a defective machine may be considered to be under a duty of best efforts concerning the quality of the repair work in general and under a duty to achieve a specific result as regards the replacement of certain spare parts 2 distinction provides criteria for determining whether a party has performed its obligations taken together the two paragraphs of this article provide judges and arbitrators with criteria by which correct performance can be evaluated in the case of an obligation to achieve a specific result a party is bound simply to achieve the promised result failure to achieve which amounts in itself to nonperformance subject to the application of the force majeure provision see article 717 on the other hand the assessment of nonperformance of an obligation of best efforts calls for a less severe judgment based on a comparison with the efforts a reasonable person of the same kind would have made in similar circumstances this distinction signifies that more will be expected from a highly specialised firm selected for its expertise than from a less sophisticated partner i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a distributor promises that it will reach a quota of 15000 sales within a year in the contract zone if at the end of the period a has sold only 13000 items it has clearly failed to perform its obligation see article 5141 content art 515 157 2 b another distributor promises to use our best efforts to expand the sales of the product in the contract zone without any stipulation that it must reach a minimum quantity this provision creates an obligation of best efforts it obliges b to take all the steps that a reasonable person placed in similar circumstances nature of the product characteristics of the market importance and experience of the firm presence of competitors etc would take to promote the sales advertising visits to customers proper service etc b does not promise the specific result of selling a certain number of items per year but does undertake to do all that can be expected of it when acting as a reasonable person see article 5142 3 longterm contracts in international contract practice especially in the context of long term contracts when provision is made for parties to work together to resolve issues that may arise it is common to speak of a duty to use best efforts to resolve such issues rather than a duty to negotiate in good faith when the parties to a longterm contract have agreed on such a duty to use best efforts that duty may amount for all practical purposes to a duty to negotiate in good faith see article 2115 comment 3 article 515 determination of kind of duty involved in determining the extent to which an obligation of a party involves a duty of best efforts in the performance of an activity or a duty to achieve a specific result regard shall be had among other factors to a the way in which the obligation is expressed in the contract b the contractual price and other terms of the contract c the degree of risk normally involved in achieving the expected result d the ability of the other party to influence the performance of the obligation art 515 unidroit principles 158 comment 1 criteria for determining the nature of the obligation it is important to determine whether an obligation involves a duty to achieve a specific result or simply a duty of best efforts as the obligation is more onerous in the former case such a determination may sometimes be difficult this article therefore establishes criteria which may offer guidance to parties judges and arbitrators although the list is not exhaustive the problems involved are frequently matters of interpretation 2 nature of the obligation as expressed by the contract the way in which an obligation is expressed in the contract may often be of assistance in determining whether the parties intended to create a duty to achieve a specific result or a duty of best efforts i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a contractor agrees to build storage facilities for b who is most keen that the work be finished in an unusually short time if a undertakes that the work will be completed before 31 december it assumes an obligation to achieve the specific result of meeting that deadline if it merely undertakes to try to complete the work before 31 december its obligation involves a duty of best efforts to attempt to meet the deadline but no guarantee that it will definitely be met see article 515a 3 price or other terms of the contract the contractual price or other terms of the contract may also offer clues as to the nature of an obligation an unusually high price or another particular nonmonetary reciprocal obligation may indicate a duty to achieve a specific result in cases where a mere duty of best efforts would normally be assumed clauses linking payment of the price to the successful outcome of the operation penalty clauses applicable if the result is not achieved and hardship clauses enabling a party to adapt the contract if circumstances make it too harsh to perform as initially agreed are other examples of contractual terms which may in one way or another assist in determining the nature of the obligation in question see article 515b 4 degree of risk in performance of an obligation when a partys performance of an obligation normally involves a high degree of risk it is generally to be expected that that party does not content art 516 159 intend to guarantee a result and that the other party does not expect such a guarantee the opposite conclusion will be drawn when the desired result can as a rule be achieved without any special difficulty see article 515c i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 a space agency undertakes to put a telecommunication satellite into orbit the rate of failure of past launchings having been 22 the space agency cannot be expected to guarantee that the orbiting will be successful the obligation is merely to observe the degree of diligence required for such launchings in view of the present state of technology 3 a promises to deliver 20 tons of steel to b on 30 june such a relatively simple operation is subject to no special risk a is committed to the specific result of delivering the required quantity of steel on the date specified and not merely to attempting to do so 5 influence of obligee over performance of an obligation in some situations one party may have a degree of influence over the performance of the other partys obligations this fact may transform into duties of best efforts obligations which might otherwise be characterised as duties to achieve specific results i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a is prepared to provide b with the technical assistance necessary to apply a newly discovered chemical process and it is agreed that b will send some of its engineers to attend training sessions organised by a a cannot promise that the new process will be mastered by the other party since that result depends in part on bs effectively sending its engineers to the training sessions on those engineers competence and on their attentiveness at the sessions see article 515d article 516 determination of quality of performance where the quality of performance is neither fixed by nor determinable from the contract a party is bound to render a performance of a quality that is reasonable and not less than average in the circumstances art 516 unidroit principles 160 comment standards have been set in article 514 concerning the exercise of best efforts but quality of performance is a wider problem addressed by article 516 if goods are to be supplied or services rendered it is not sufficient to supply those goods or to render those services they must also be of a certain quality the contract will often be explicit as regards the quality due grade 1 oil or it will provide elements making that quality determinable in other cases the rule established by article 516 is that the quality must be reasonable and not less than average in the circumstances two criteria are thus combined i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a undertakes to build a hotel next to a busy railway station the contract provides for adequate sound isolation the quality of which is not more precisely determined it is however determinable from the contract that the sound isolation must meet the high standards needed in view of the hotels proximity to a railway station 1 performance must be of average quality the minimum requirement is that of providing goods of average quality the supplier is not bound to provide goods or services of superior quality if that is not required by the contract but neither may it deliver goods or services of inferior quality this average quality is determined according to the circumstances which normally means that which is available on the relevant market at the time of performance there may for example have been a recent technological advance other factors may also be of relevance such as the specific qualifications for which the performing party was chosen i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a buys 500 kgs of oranges from b if the contract says nothing more precise and no other circumstances call for a different solution those oranges may not be of less than average quality average quality will however suffice unless it is unreasonably defective content art 517 161 2 performance must be reasonable the additional reference to reasonableness is intended to prevent a party from claiming that it has performed adequately if it has rendered an average performance in a market where the average quality is most unsatisfactory and is intended to give the judge or arbitrator an opportunity to raise those insufficient standards i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 a company based in country x organises a banquet to celebrate its 50th anniversary since the cuisine in country x is mediocre the company orders the meal from a renowned restaurant in paris in these circumstances the quality of the food provided must not be less than the average standards of the parisian restaurant it would clearly not be sufficient simply to meet the average standards of country x article 517 price determination 1 where a contract does not fix or make provision for determining the price the parties are considered in the absence of any indication to the contrary to have made reference to the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such performance in comparable circumstances in the trade concerned or if no such price is available to a reasonable price 2 where the price is to be determined by one party and that determination is manifestly unreasonable a reasonable price shall be substituted notwithstanding any contract term to the contrary 3 where the price is to be fixed by one party or a third person and that party or third person does not do so the price shall be a reasonable price 4 where the price is to be fixed by ref erence to factors which do not exist or have ceased to exist or to be accessible the nearest equivalent factor shall be treated as a substitute art 517 unidroit principles 162 comment 1 general rule governing price determination a contract usually fixes the price to be paid or makes provision for its determination if however this is not the case paragraph 1 of this article presumes that the parties have made reference to the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such performance in comparable circumstances in the trade concerned all these qualifications are of course significant the provision also permits the rebuttal of the presumption if there is any indication to the contrary this article is inspired by article 55 cisg the rule has the necessary flexibility to meet the needs of international trade it is true that in some cases the price usually charged on the market may not satisfy the reasonableness test which prevails elsewhere in this article recourse would then have to be made to the general provision on good faith and fair dealing see article 17 or possibly to some of the provisions on mistake fraud and gross disparity see chapter 3 section 2 some international contracts relate to operations which are unique or at least very specific in respect of which it is not possible to refer to the price charged for similar performance in comparable circumstances according to paragraph 1 the parties are then deemed to have made reference to a reasonable price and the party in question will fix the price at a reasonable level subject to the possible review by courts or arbitral tribunals i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a firm specialised in express mailing throughout the world receives from b a parcel to be delivered as soon as possible from country x to country y nothing is said as to the price a should bill b with the price usually charged in the sector for such a service 2 the next order which a receives from b is one to deliver another parcel as soon as possible to remote and not easily accessible country z where a team of explorers is in need of urgent supplies again nothing is said as to price but since no possible market comparison can be made a must act reasonably when fixing the price 2 determination of price by one party in some cases the contract expressly provides that the price will be determined by one of the parties this happens frequently in several sectors for example the supply of services the price cannot easily be content art 517 163 determined in advance and the performing party is in the best position to place a value on what it has done in those cases where the parties have made such a provision for determining the price it will be enforced to avoid possible abuses however paragraph 2 enables judges or arbitrators to replace a mani festly unreasonable price by a reasonable one this provision is mandatory if the party does not determine the price paragraph 3 provides that the price possibly determined by judges or arbitrators shall be reasonable 3 determination of price by third person a provision that the price will be determined by a third person can give rise to serious difficulty if that third person is unable to accomplish the mission not being the expert he or she was thought to be or does not do so paragraph 3 provides that the price possibly determined by judges or arbitrators shall be reasonable if the third person determines the price in circumstances that may involve fraud threat or gross disparity article 3282 may apply the parties are free to fix the standards or procedure with which the third person must comply in determining the price the parties can challenge the determination if it does not comply with those standards or that procedure the parties may also set out the grounds on which the determination of a price by a third person can be challenged which may vary depending on the nature of the determination as an example if the agreed standard concerns an opinion as to market price the parties may agree that the price determined by an expert can be challenged on the basis that it is manifestly unreasonable in another case if the standard concerns the ascertainment of a fact such as midpoint of an index the parties may agree the price can be challenged if it is erroneous 4 determination of price by reference to external factors in some situations the price is to be fixed by reference to external factors typically a published index or quotations on a commodity exchange in cases where the reference factor ceases to exist or to be accessible paragraph 4 provides that the nearest equivalent factor shall be treated as a substitute art 518 unidroit principles 164 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the price of a construction contract is linked to several indexes including the official index of charges in the construction sector regularly published by the local government several instalments of the price still have to be calculated when that index ceases to be published the construction federation a private trade association decides however to start publishing a similar index to replace the former one and in these circumstances the new index will serve as a substitute article 518 termination of a contract for an indefinite period a contract for an indefinite period may be terminated by either party by giving notice a reasonable time in advance as to the effects of termination in general and as to restitution the provisions in articles 735 and 737 apply comment 1 contract for an indefinite period the duration of a contract is often specified by an express provision or it may be determined from the nature and purpose of the contract eg technical expertise provided in order to assist in performing specialised work however there are cases when the duration is neither determined nor determinable parties can also stipulate that their contract is concluded for an indefinite period the article provides that in such cases either party may terminate the contractual relationship by giving notice a reasonable time in advance what a reasonable time in advance will be depends on circumstances such as the period of time the parties have been cooperating the importance of their relative investments in the relationship the time needed to find new partners etc the rule can be understood as a gapfilling provision in cases where parties have failed to specify the duration of their contract more generally it also relates to the widely recognised principle that contracts may not bind the parties eternally and that they may always opt out of such contracts provided they give notice a reasonable time in advance content art 518 165 this situation is to be distinguished from the case of hardship which is covered by articles 621 to 623 hardship requires a fundamental change of the equilibrium of the contract and gives rise at least in the first instance to renegotiations the rule in this article requires no special condition to be met except that the duration of the contract be indefinite and that it permit unilateral termination i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a agrees to distribute bs products in country x the contract is concluded for an indefinite period either party may terminate the contract by giving the other party notice a reasonable time in advance 2 termination and its consequences the effects of termination in general are those set out in article 735 both parties are released from their obligation to render and to receive future performance the fact that by virtue of termination the contract is brought to an end does not deprive a party to the contract of its right to claim damages for any nonperformance i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 after the contract has been in operation for five years b gives notice of termination it is subsequently determined that for a period of six months during the year before b had given notice of termination a failed to discharge its obligations under the contract as a result b suffered a loss of income notwithstanding the termination b may claim damages under the rules set out in chapter 7 section 4 termination also does not affect any provision in the contract for the settlement of disputes or any other term of the contract which is to operate even after termination see comments 3 and 4 on article 735 performance of a contract for an indefinite period might have been made over a long period of time before the contract is terminated and it may thus be inconvenient to unravel such performance furthermore termination is a remedy with prospective effect only restitution can therefore be claimed only in respect of the period after termination this is set out in article 7371 with the consequence that as far as restitution has to be made the provisions of article 736 apply as set out in article 7372 art 519 unidroit principles 166 article 519 release by agreement 1 an obligee may release its right by agreement with the obligor 2 an offer to release a right gratuitously shall be deemed accepted if the obligor does not reject the offer without delay after having become aware of it comment an obligee may wish to release the obligor from its obligation or in case the obligor owes more than one obligation from more than one or from all its obligations the release may either be a separate act or constitute a part of a more complex transaction between the parties eg a compromise which settles a dispute between them this article provides that such renunciation of the obligees rights requires an agreement between the parties irrespective of whether the obligee renounces its rights for value or gratuitously in the latter case while the obligor should not be compelled to accept a benefit against its will it will normally consent to accepting the benefit for this reason paragraph 2 provides that a gratuitous offer shall be deemed accepted if the obligor does not reject the offer without delay after having become aware of it i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company a is in financial difficulties and needs the co operation of its creditors in order to survive bank b is prepared to renounce 50 of its claim against a and the interest that has fallen due on condition that a pay an interest of 9 instead of the 5 paid previously on the remaining debt b sends a notice to this effect on 15 january by 22 january a has not reacted to the notice bs renunciation will only be effective after a has accepted bs offer in accordance with article 216 et seq 2 company a is in financial difficulties and needs the co operation of its creditors in order to survive bank b is prepared to renounce 50 of its claim against a and the interest that has fallen due and sends a a notice to this effect on 15 january by 22 january a has not reacted to the notice bs offer is deemed to be accepted by a 167 section 2 third party rights article 521 contracts in favour of third parties 1 the parties the promisor and the promisee may confer by express or implied agreement a right on a third party the beneficiary 2 the existence and content of the beneficiarys right against the promisor are determined by the agreement of the parties and are subject to any conditions or other limitations under the agreement comment usually contracts are intended by the parties to create rights and obligations between themselves in such cases only the parties will acquire rights and duties under the contract the mere fact that a third party will benefit from the performance of the contract does not in itself give that third party any rights under the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 professor a makes a contract with the university of country x under which he agrees to give forty onehour lectures comparing the laws of contract of countries x and y a only appears for twenty lectures and does not mention the law of country y in the lectures t a student does not acquire rights under the contract between a and the university however third parties are not always left without rights the underlying principle is that of the autonomy of the parties who if they wish to create rights in a third party should be free to do so the parties may state expressly that this is their intention but this is not essential since the intention to benefit the third party may be implicit in the contract in cases where implied intention is alleged the decision will turn on all the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case the following are illustrations of implied intention art 521 unidroit principles 168 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 a takes out a policy of insurance on its fleet of lorries which are regularly driven by its employees the contract provides that the insurance company will cover anyone driving a lorry with as consent an employee t has an accident while driving the lorry t is covered in respect of its liability for the accident 3 a sells his business to b on the terms that b will pay a gbp 1000 a month for the rest of his life and will pay as wife t gbp 500 a month if a predeceases her a dies b refuses to pay t

erection of the library is made by b a company wholly owned by the university although the contractor well knows that when completed the library will be occupied and used by a the building has been badly built and it will cost usd 5000000 to complete it satisfactorily a can recover the cost of the remedial work 5 a the developer of a shopping mall concludes a contract with b a security firm to provide security at the mall both a and b know that the shops will be operated by tenants of a these tenants are told that one of the major attractions of the mall will be the high level of security provided by b it is a term of the contract between a and b that all employees of b working at the mall will be ex policemen personally selected by bs chief executive in fact selection is delegated to a consultancy firm which recruits many unsuitable people there are many thefts at the shops tenants who suffer losses will have contractual claims against b the following are illustrations where there is no such implied intention unless the circumstances clearly indicate otherwise i l l u s t r a t i o n s 6 a goes to an expensive furrier and selects and buys a coat a tells the assistant truthfully

contract right 8 a a company from country x sells materials to b a company from country y a knows that b plans to resell the materials to t a pharmaceutical company from country z which will use the materials for the manufacture of a new drug under a contract which will effectively limit bs liability to t to usd 1000000 the materials are defective and ts losses greatly exceed usd 1000000 t has no enforceable contract right against a the application of this article will often come up in the context of an associated claim in tort this possibility is outside the scope of the principles it follows from the scheme of this article that an express statement that the parties do not intend to create rights in a third party will be effective it also follows that the promisor and promisee enjoy broad powers to shape the rights created in favour of the beneficiary in this context the word rights should be interpreted liberally in principle a third party beneficiary will have the full range of contractual remedies including the right to performance and damages article 522 third party identifiable the beneficiary must be identifiable with adequate certainty by the contract but need not be in existence at the time the contract is made comment the parties may well wish to make a contract in which the identity of the third party is not known at the time the contract is made but a mechanism is provided by which it will become known by the time performance is due this might be by providing that the parties or one of them can identify the beneficiary at a later date or by choosing a definition of the beneficiary of which later circumstances will serve to make the identity clear art 523 unidroit principles 170 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a married man with children but no grandchildren makes a contract with the xyz insurance company under which a pays gbp 10 a month to the insurance company and they promise to pay gbp 10000 to each of his grandchildren on his death grandchildren born after the date of the contract but before as death are entitled to gbp 10000 2 company a launches a takeover bid for company b a public company the shares of which are traded on leading stock exchanges b engages c a leading firm of accountants to prepare a report on b for distribution to shareholders the contract between b and c requires c to produce an honest thorough and competent report owing to incompetence c produces a report that is much too favourable to b as a result the majority of shareholders vote to reject as offer some shareholders show copies of the report to friends who buy shares in b the old shareholders can acquire rights under the contract between b and c but the new shareholders cannot article 523 exclusion and limitation clauses the conferment of rights in the beneficiary includes the right to invoke a clause in the contract which excludes or limits the liability of the beneficiary comment contractual provisions limiting or excluding liability of those who are not parties to the contract are very common particularly in contracts of carriage where they often form part of a settled pattern of insurance perhaps the best known example is the socalled himalaya clause which in some form is frequently to be found in bills of lading in general the autonomy of the parties should be respected in this area too i l l u s t r a t i o n a the owner of goods makes a contract with a sea carrier to carry them from country x to country y the bill of lading is subject to the haguevisby rules and purports to exclude the liability of a the master and crew b stevedores employed in loading and unloading the cargo and c the owners of ships onto which the goods may be transhipped these exclusions will be effective third party rights art 524 171 another situation which would be covered by this article arises where the promisor and promisee agree that the beneficiary shall be released from an obligation which it owed the promisor article 524 defences the promisor may assert against the beneficiary all defences which the promisor could assert against the promisee comment under article 521 the content of the beneficiarys right may be made subject to any conditions or limitations devised by the parties the promisor and promisee may devise a contract in which the position of the beneficiary is significantly different from that of the promisee the parties autonomy is in principle unlimited but they may well not provide expressly for all possibilities the normal default rule will therefore be as stated in this article i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a takes out a policy of life insurance with insurance company b in favour of c the contract provides for the payment of premiums for 25 years but after 5 years a stops paying premiums the position of c will be modelled on that of a if the policy had been in as favour such policies do not usually deny all return on the premiums paid if however the policy had been liable to be set aside by the insurance company for instance because a had not made material disclosure then b would normally be entitled to raise this defence against c 2 company a takes out a policy of fidelity insurance with insurance company b to cover dishonest employees the insurance policy provides that b will indemnify in full customers who are defrauded by employees of a and that it will indemnify a only if a has not been negligent in the selection or supervision of the employees clearly in such a contract b will have defences against a which it cannot raise against the customers art 525 unidroit principles 172 article 525 revocation the parties may modify or revoke the rights conferred by the contract on the bene ficiary until the beneficiary has accepted them or reasonably acted in reliance on them comment it might be the rule that the promisor and promisee are free to revoke the third partys rights at any time or contrariwise that the third partys rights are immutable once the contract is concluded it appears that few systems adopt either of these extreme positions the solution adopted is that the third partys rights become irrevocable once the third party has either accepted the rights or has reasonably acted in reliance on them it will of course be open to the parties to provide for a different regime in the contract either by making the beneficiarys rights irrevocable sooner or by preserving a right of revocation even after the beneficiary has acted in reliance on the rights there may well be situations where a right of revocation is given only to one party for example in a contract of life insurance it might be provided that the insured can change the beneficiary there might be relevant usages which limit the possibility of revocation i l l u s t r a t i o n a the main contractor on a major construction contract takes out a policy of insurance with insurance company b to cover damage to the work in progress the policy is expressed to cover the interests of all subcontractors involved in the contract and the subcontractors are all told of the policy c a subcontractor does not take out any insurance itself but does not tell a or b absent clear words to the contrary cs reliance makes the contract between a and b irrevocable third party rights art 526 173 article 526 renunciation the beneficiary may renounce a right conferred on it comment the scheme of this section assumes that absent contrary provision the contract between promisor and promisee creates rights in the beneficiary at once without any need for acceptance by the beneficiary although the third party will usually welcome the benefit which the parties have conferred upon it it cannot be forced to accept it it follows that the third party may expressly or impliedly renounce the benefit however once the beneficiary has done something that amounts to acceptance it should not normally be entitled to renounce i l l u s t r a t i o n on the facts given in the illustration to article 525 c a sub contractor may not wish to take advantage of the insurance taken out by the main contractor because it already has relevant insurance in place and it knows that there will be difficulties if there are two insurances covering the same risk c is entitled to renounce 174 section 3 conditions article 531 types of condition a contract or a contractual obligation may be made conditional upon the occurrence of a future uncertain event so that the contract or the contractual obligation only takes effect if the event occurs suspensive condition or comes to an end if the event occurs resolutive condition comment 1 scope of this section parties to a contract may make their contract or one or several obligations arising under it dependent on the occurrence or non occurrence of a future uncertain event a provision to this effect is called a condition conditions governed by the principles include both those that determine whether a contract exists and those that determine obligations within a contract accordingly application of the principles may in some circumstances impose duties even in the absence of a contract see eg articles 533 and 534 a condition may refer to a range of events including natural events or acts of a third person this section only deals with conditions that originate in an agreement between the parties conditions imposed by law are not covered by this section unless they are incorporated into the contract by the parties thus a public permission requirement imposed by law is outside the scope of this section but may be governed by article 6114 however if the parties introduce a provision making the contract or their contractual obligations arising under it dependent upon a public permission being granted then that provision is a condition 2 notion of condition the word condition may have a number of meanings for instance in some jurisdictions condition means a major term of the contract that is not the sense in which the term condition is used in this section conditions art 531 175 some contracts may provide that the performance by one party is dependent upon the performance of the other party these provisions are not conditions they merely specify the obligations of both parties under their contract i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 in a share purchase and sale agreement concluded between seller a incorporated in country x and purchaser b incorporated in country y bs obligation to pay the agreed price is subject to as having performed all of its obligations hereunder to be performed on or before a certain date this performance is not a condition but a contractual obligation and as such is not an uncertain event the parties may also fix a specific date at which the contract or one or several of the obligations arising under it is to take effect or is to come to an end in many jurisdictions these provisions are referred to as terms they are not conditions under this section the same holds true when the parties include a provision in their contract that makes the contract or one or several of the obligations arising under the contract dependent upon the occurrence of a future event that is bound to happen i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 a contract of sale is concluded on 2 october with the delivery of the goods to be made on 10 october the obligation to deliver is not conditional because it is not subject to a future uncertain event 3 architect a who intends to renovate her offices borrows money from a bank and the loan agreement provides that title to a particular property a owns will pass to the bank on as death this is not a condition since as death is certain to occur the parties may in their contract provide for a time by which the condition has to occur i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a share purchase agreement is concluded between a and b it will take effect if all necessary authorisations are received by 30 january the agreement is conditional and it includes a date by which the condition has to occur if the parties obligations are to come into effect if the contract does not state a specific time by which the condition must occur in appropriate circumstances the time may be implied on the basis of an interpretation of the intentions of the parties under chapter 4 art 531 unidroit principles 176 3 suspensive and resolutive conditions a contract or contractual obligation can be made to depend upon the occurrence of a future uncertain event so that it takes effect only if the event occurs under the principles this is a suspensive condition in some jurisdictions it is known as condition precedent i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a merger contract is concluded between a and b subject to as having received the necessary antitrust clearance for the transaction from the relevant authorities before a specific date a contract or a contractual obligation can be made to come to an end upon the occurrence of a future uncertain event under the principles this is a resolutive condition in some jurisdictions it is known as condition subsequent i l l u s t r a t i o n 6 a contract appointing b as a fund manager to manage the investments of a company provides that the agreement is to come to an end if b loses its licence to conduct the fund management business instead of agreeing on a resolutive condition the parties to a contract may agree that one or both of them may under certain circumstances have the right to terminate the contract 4 condition entirely dependent on the will of the obligor sometimes the contract or contractual obligation is made dependent upon an event which is entirely in the discretion of the obligor in this case the question is of whether the obligor really wants to be bound this is a question of interpretation if it appears that there is no intention to be bound there is no contract nor is there any contractual obligation i l l u s t r a t i o n 7 a document drawn up between a and b contains a list of provisions one of them states that a contract of sale will come into being if a decides to sell certain goods a is under no obligation not even a conditional one in view of the fact that it is within as unfettered discretion to decide whether or not a wants to sell the goods the fact that a may be under a precontractual obligation not to act in bad faith is irrelevant in this case in some cases there is a conditional obligation in spite of the fact that one party has a choice whether or not to conclude the contract this conditions art 531 177 holds true when the freedom of choice is in actual fact dependent upon external factors i l l u s t r a t i o n 8 an international merger agreement provides for the merger within a certain period of time of two subsidiaries of a parent company subject to approval by the board of directors of one of the companies under the applicable law the approval cannot be unreasonably withheld there is a conditional obligation since the condition is not entirely dependent on the will of one of the parties 5 closing parties to complex and highvalue business transactions that involve prolonged negotiations frequently provide for a socalled closing procedure ie the formal acknowledgement closing at a certain point in time closing date that on or before that date all the stipulated conditions conditions precedent have been satisfied normally but not necessarily on the closing date the parties will sign a document which confirms that no condition precedent survives or if some conditions have not been satisfied that they have been waived despite the terminology used by the parties not all the events referred to as conditions precedent are conditions as defined by this article in actual practice there are mixed provisions thus for instance events such as the receipt of all necessary antitrust clearances the admittance to trading on a stock exchange the granting of an export licence and the obtaining of a bank loan may be true suspensive conditions because they are events that are not certain to occur other terms such as the accuracy of one partys representations or warranties the commitment to perform or abstain from some specific acts and the submission of a tax certificate that evidences that no taxes are due by the party concerned are in fact obligations that the parties have agreed to fulfil before the formal conclusion completion of the transaction these are not events that are uncertain to occur and therefore these provisions are not conditions under the principles also with respect to the effects of a closing there is no clearcut rule as to whether or not a term is a condition in practice it is difficult to derive a logical answer from the clauses themselves in particular clauses named conditions precedent often mix up real conditions and specific matters that still need to be agreed upon or real obligations that the parties must fulfil in the course of the negotiations see article 2113 art 532 unidroit principles 178 i l l u s t r a t i o n 9 a share capital increase agreement negotiated between issuer a and lead manager b under the heading conditions precedent provides as follows the obligation of the lead manager at the closing date to subscribe for the shares is subject to the realisation of the following conditions precedent on or prior to the closing date a accuracy of representations and warranties b performance of undertakings the issuer has performed all of those of its obligations hereunder to be performed on or before the closing date c admittance to trading on stock exchange d delivery of any and all closing documents the lead manager shall have received the following documents on or before the closing date if any one of the above conditions has not been satisfied at the time it should have been satisfied pursuant to this section the obligations of the lead manager may be terminated by the lead manager in this illustration the contract consists of a mixture of legal obligations and suspensive conditions item c is a suspensive condition as it is outside the control of the parties items a and b embody contractual obligations and item d embodies a contractual obligation as regards the documents a party is under an obligation to procure but a suspensive condition as regards other documents article 532 effect of conditions unless the parties otherwise agree a the relevant contract or contractual obligation takes effect upon fulfilment of a suspensive condition b the relevant contract or contractual obligation comes to an end upon fulfilment of a resolutive condition conditions art 533 179 comment 1 a general default rule under the principles unless the parties otherwise agree the fulfilment of a condition has prospective effect only it does not operate retroactively parties are encouraged to express whether a condition operates retroactively or prospectively 2 no retroactive effect in the case of a suspensive condition the contract or contractual obligation automatically becomes effective from the moment the future uncertain event occurs i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 the facts are the same as in illustration 5 to article 531 the contract takes effect if and when the necessary antitrust clearance is obtained in the case of a resolutive condition the contract or contractual obligation comes to an end from the moment the future uncertain event occurs i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 6 to article 531 the contract comes to an end if and when b loses its licence article 533 interference with conditions 1 if fulfilment of a condition is prevented by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of cooperation that party may not rely on the nonfulfilment of the condition 2 if fulfilment of a condition is brought about by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of cooperation art 533 unidroit principles 180 that party may not rely on the fulfilment of the condition comment this article on interference with conditions is a specific application of the general rules on good faith and fair dealing see article 17 inconsistent behaviour see article 18 and cooperation between the parties see article 513 under this article the party is not under an obligation to use all reasonable efforts to bring about the fulfilment of the condition this article merely states that the party who contrary to the duties of good faith and fair dealing or cooperation prevents the condition from being fulfilled may not rely on the nonfulfilment of the condition if on the contrary the party brings about the fulfilment of a condition contrary to the duties of good faith and fair dealing or cooperation that party may not rely on the fulfilment of the condition whether or not a party is under an obligation to use all reasonable efforts to bring about the fulfilment of a condition is a matter of interpretation in commercial practice the parties themselves may expressly provide for the observance of the principle of good faith as regards all the events upon which completion of the transaction is conditional or go beyond this minimum standard and impose a duty to use their best efforts to bring about the fulfilment of the conditions as soon as practicable these clauses may also be imposed on one party only see article 514 the available remedies right to performance or damages are to be determined in accordance with the contractual provisions and the general rules on these remedies as well as with the particular circumstances of the case four factual situations can be distinguished to illustrate the operation of this article a where the fulfilment of a suspensive condition is prevented by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of cooperation that party may not rely on the nonfulfilment of the condition i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 the licensing of software by b to a is agreed by the parties to be dependent upon the professional approval of the software by an independent computer engineer c who is nominated by b b regrets the bargain and bribes c not to approve the software because of the conditions art 533 181 bribe c states that it does not approve the software b is not allowed to rely on the nonfulfilment of the condition ie b cannot refuse to perform the obligation under the contract when asked by a to do so b where the fulfilment of a resolutive condition is prevented by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of cooperation that party may not rely on the nonfulfilment of the condition i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a hires earthmoving equipment from b for the time necessary for a to purchase its own equipment as a commercial favour to a the rate of hire is below the market rate bs obligation to make the earthmoving equipment available is subject to the resolutive condition that it comes to an end if a acquires its own earthmoving equipment a turns down very attractive offers in order to continue benefiting from the favourable rate of hire a may not rely on the nonfulfilment of the condition c where the fulfilment of a suspensive condition is brought about by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of cooperation that party may not rely on the fulfilment of the condition i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b bribes c to give its approval of the software despite cs professional misgivings about the software b is not allowed to rely on the fulfilment of the condition ie b cannot ask a to perform the contract d where the fulfilment of a resolutive condition is brought about by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of cooperation that party may not rely on the fulfilment of the condition i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a appoints b as its agent for the promotion and sale of as products the agreement is to come to an end if the gross amount of sales made by b fails to reach eur 1000000 by 31 december the second year a who has found another party willing to act as agent on terms more favourable to a than b withholds supplies to b with the result that by the above date bs gross sales fall well short of eur 1000000 a may not rely on this to treat the agreement with b as having come to an end art 534 unidroit principles 182 article 534 duty to preserve rights pending fulfilment of a condition a party may not contrary to the duty to act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing act so as to prejudice the other partys rights in case of fulfilment of the condition comment this article only relates to the acts performed during the period that precedes the time when the condition is fulfilled it does not concern acts which amount to an interference with conditions these acts are dealt with by article 533 the situation in which fulfilment of the condition is pending is specific and deserves special treatment in application of the general principle of good faith and fair dealing see article 17 indeed a person who would benefit from the fulfilment of a condition has a conditional right which deserves protection particularly in the case of a suspensive condition during the period pending fulfilment of the condition one partys actions may detrimentally affect the other partys position this article assumes that it is generally better to prevent such actions than to cure their effects this article is also important as a reminder to the parties to consider this issue and even state expressly what measures the person who would benefit from the fulfilment of the condition might take in order to preserve its rights in commercial practice parties may draft a specific provision sometimes known as covenant of ordinary course of business that produces effects between the date of signature and the closing date and restricts the parties right to dispose of assets only to those transactions that fall within the ordinary course of business i l l u s t r a t i o n a share purchase agreement entered into between the seller a and the purchaser b provides that the transaction will be completed only if at the closing date all the conditions have been met including bs having obtained the necessary credit from its banks a is bound to restrict its activity to ordinary business management and b is under a conditions art 535 183 duty of confidentiality as to any information concerning the company that it has received in the course of negotiations article 535 restitution in case of fulfilment of a resolutive condition 1 on fulfilment of a resolutive condition the rules on restitution set out in articles 736 and 737 apply with appropriate adaptations 2 if the parties have agreed that the resolutive condition is to operate retroactively the rules on restitution set out in article 3215 apply with appropriate adaptations comment when a contract subject to a resolutive condition comes to an end as a result of the fulfilment of the resolutive condition the parties will often have performed fully or in part their obligations under the contract the question then arises whether and if so under which rules the parties have to make restitution of what they have received under the principles the fulfilment of a resolutive condition normally has prospective effects only for this reason restitution will have to follow the regime set out in articles 736 and 737 on restitution following the termination of a contract which also operates only prospectively the specificity of this restitution regime visvis the restitution regime set out in article 3215 is that for contracts to be performed over a period of time restitution cannot be claimed for the period prior to the moment when the contract came to an end however under the principles parties are free to determine that a resolutive condition is to operate retroactively under these circumstances it appears to be appropriate to apply the restitution regime set out in article 3215 restitution following avoidance since avoidance also operates retroactively there is no special rule for restitution in the case of contracts performed over a period of time 184 chapter 6 performance section 1 performance in general article 611 time of performance a party must perform its obligations a if a time is fixed by or determinable from the contract at that time b if a period of time is fixed by or determinable from the contract at any time within that period unless circumstances indicate that the other party is to choose a time c in any other case within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract comment with a view to determining when a contractual obligation is to be performed this article which is inspired by article 33 cisg distin guishes three situations the first is where the contract stipulates the precise time for performance or makes it determinable if the contract does not specify a precise moment but a period of time for performing any time during that period chosen by the performing party will be acceptable unless circumstances indicate that the other party is to choose the time finally in all other cases performance is due within a reasonable time i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a offers to advise b in the latters plans to buy computer equipment and software and it is agreed that as experts will visit b in may it is in principle for a to announce when precisely in performance in general art 612 185 may that visit will take place the circumstances may however leave the option to b as would be the case if the contract expressly left to b the choice of the precise dates or where for example it was understood that some of bs staff who are often absent on business trips must be present when as experts arrive see article 611b 2 a a building contractor encounters unusual difficulties when excavating a site and needs special equipment to continue the work which it does not have a immediately telephones b another contractor who has the necessary equipment and agrees to lend it to a nothing however is said as to when the equipment should be delivered to a performance is then to take place within a reasonable time in the circumstances since the work has been interrupted because of the abovementioned difficulties a urgently needs to receive the equipment and in such a case within a reasonable time probably means that performance is due almost immediately see article 611c article 612 performance at one time or in instalments in cases under article 611b or c a party must perform its obligations at one time if that performance can be rendered at one time and the circumstances do not indicate otherwise comment a partys performance is of necessity sometimes rendered at one time eg delivery of a single object or alternatively must take place over a period of time eg construction there are however also cases where it can be rendered either at one time or in instalments eg delivery of quantities of goods this article addresses the latter situation in circumstances where there is no contractual provision as to how such performance should be rendered or where it is not de terminable from the contract the principle stated is that performance is due at one time unless the circumstances indicate otherwise i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a promises to deliver 100 tons of coal to b in march it would be materially possible and perhaps convenient for a to deliver the 100 tons in instalments for instance 25 tons each week art 613 unidroit principles 186 of the month in principle however according to article 612 a must deliver the 100 tons at one time 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b needs the coal gradually to meet the needs of its operations b also has limited storage facilities and could not cope adequately with a consignment of 100 tons at any one time a knows of bs specific needs here the circumstances suggest that a should deliver in instalments during the month of march article 613 partial performance 1 the obligee may reject an offer to perform in part at the time performance is due whether or not such offer is coupled with an assurance as to the balance of the performance unless the obligee has no legitimate interest in so doing 2 additional expenses caused to the obli gee by partial performance are to be borne by the obligor without prejudice to any other remedy comment 1 partial performance distinguished from performance at one time or in instalments the situation covered by this article should be distinguished from that of article 612 article 612 attempts to solve a preliminary question which concerns only certain special cases if a partys performance can be rendered at one time or in instalments and if the contract does not make it clear or determinable how that party is to perform it must in principle perform at one time this article has a more general scope it provides that at the time performance is due the obligee may in principle reject an offer of partial performance this applies at maturity irrespective of whether what is due then is a global performance or an instalment of a wider obligation which in some cases has been previously determined on the basis of article 612 performance in general art 613 187 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a owes usd 1000000 to a bank and it has been agreed that a will pay back usd 100000 on the first day of each month starting in january on 1 april a offers to reimburse only usd 50000 and the balance two weeks later in principle the bank is entitled to refuse as proposal 2 obligee entitled in principle to reject partial performance when performance is due at maturity be it the whole performance or an instalment that which is due must be performed completely in principle the obligee may reject an offer of partial performance whether or not it is coupled with an assurance as to the balance of the performance since it is entitled to receive the whole of what was stipulated subject to what will be said below partial performance normally constitutes a breach of contract a party who does not obtain full performance at maturity may resort to the available remedies as a rule the obligee has a legitimate interest in requiring full performance of what was promised at the time that performance is due the obligee may of course also refrain from rejecting the offer to perform in part while reserving its rights as to the breach or may accept it without any reservation in which case partial performance can no longer be treated as a nonperformance i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a wishes to open a branch office in country x and rents the necessary office space in a building under construction due to be finished in time for the move on 1 september on that date only four of the ten offices are made available to a with an assurance that the remaining six will be ready in one month in principle a may refuse to move into those four offices 3 obligees right to reject partial performance conditional on its legitimate interest in so doing there may be situations where the obligees legitimate interest in receiving full performance is not apparent and where temporary acceptance of partial performance will not cause any significant harm to the obligee if the party tendering partial performance proves this to be the case the obligee cannot then refuse such partial performance subject to paragraph 2 and there is no nonperformance in such cases this may be seen as a consequence of the general principle of good faith and fair dealing enunciated in article 17 art 614 unidroit principles 188 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 an airline promises to transport 10 automobiles from italy to brazil in one single consignment due to be delivered on a definite date when performance is due some circumstances make it difficult although not impossible for the airline to find sufficient space in a single aircraft the airline suggests making two successive deliveries within a week it is established that this will cause no inconvenience to the purchaser of the cars which will not actually be used before the following month in such a case the obligee has no legitimate interest in refusing partial performance 4 additional expenses entailed by partial performance to be borne by obligor if partial performance is accepted it may entail additional expenses for the obligee in all cases such expenses are to be borne by the other party if partial performance amounts to a nonperformance as it usually does these expenses will be part of the damages without prejudice to any other available remedy if partial performance does not amount to a nonperformance the obligee has been shown not to have any legitimate interest in rejecting the offer of partial performance or has found the offer to be acceptable without reservation it will only be entitled to those expenses i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 if the purchaser has to meet additional expenses on account of having to make double arrangements for picking up the cars at the airport those extra costs will be borne by the airline article 614 order of performance 1 to the extent that the performances of the parties can be rendered simultaneously the parties are bound to render them simultaneously unless the circumstances indicate otherwise 2 to the extent that the performance of only one party requires a period of time that party is bound to render its performance first unless the circumstances indicate otherwise performance in general art 614 189 comment in bilateral contracts where each of the parties has an obligation towards the other the basic but complex question arises of which party is to perform first if the parties have not made any specific arrangements then in practice much will depend on usages and it must also be recalled that there are often several obligations on each side which may have to be performed at different times this article states two broad principles while recognising that in both cases the circumstances may indicate otherwise in effect the main purpose of this article is to draw the parties attention to the problem of order of performance and to encourage them where necessary to draft appropriate contractual provisions a distinction is drawn between cases where the parties performances can be rendered simultaneously and those where the performance of only one party requires a period of time 1 simultaneous performance to be made when possible in the first situation the rule is that the parties are bound to perform simultaneously paragraph 1 a seller is entitled to payment on delivery but circumstances may indicate otherwise for example any exception originating from the terms of the contract or from usages which may allow a party to perform some time after the other i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a and b agree to barter a certain quantity of oil against a certain quantity of cotton unless circumstances indicate otherwise the commodities should be exchanged simultaneously 2 exception where performance requires a period of time if the performance of only one partys obligation by its very nature requires a period of time for example in construction and most service contracts the rule established in paragraph 2 is that that party is bound to render its performance first circumstances may frequently however indicate the contrary thus insurance premiums are normally paid in advance as also are rent and freight charges in construction contracts payments are usually made in agreed instalments throughout the duration of the work art 615 unidroit principles 190 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a promises to write a legal opinion to assist b in an arbitration if no arrangement is made as to when a should be paid for the services a must prepare the opinion before asking to be paid 3 relation of order of performance to withholding of performance this article sets out the rules which will condition the application of article 713 concerning the withholding of performance article 615 earlier performance 1 the obligee may reject an earlier performance unless it has no legitimate interest in so doing 2 acceptance by a party of an earlier performance does not affect the time for the performance of its own obligations if that time has been fixed irrespective of the performance of the other partys obligations 3 additional expenses caused to the obligee by earlier performance are to be borne by the obligor without prejudice to any other remedy comment 1 obligee in principle entitled to reject earlier performance when performance is due at a certain moment to be determined in accordance with article 611 it must take place at that time and in principle the obligee may reject an earlier performance usually the time set for performance is geared to the obligees activities and earlier performance may cause it inconvenience the obligee has therefore a legitimate interest in refusing it earlier performance in principle constitutes nonperformance of the contract performance in general art 615 191 the obligee may of course also abstain from rejecting an earlier performance while reserving its rights as to the nonperformance it may also accept such performance without reservation in which case earlier performance can no longer be treated as nonperformance i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a agrees to carry out the annual maintenance of all lifts in bs office building on 15 october as employees arrive on 14 october a day on which important meetings with many visitors are taking place in the building b is entitled to refuse such earlier performance which would cause it obvious inconvenience 2 obligees right to reject earlier performance conditional on its legitimate interest in so doing situations may arise in which the obligees legitimate interest in timely performance is not apparent and when its accepting earlier performance will not cause it any significant harm if the party offering earlier performance proves this to be the case the other party cannot reject earlier performance i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that neither 14 nor 15 october has any special significance a can probably prove that b has no legitimate interest in refusing the earlier performance 3 effect of acceptance by obligee on its own performance of earlier performance of the other partys obligations if one party accepts earlier performance by the other the question arises of whether this affects the time for performance of its own obligations paragraph 2 deals with cases where obligations are due at a certain time which is not linked to the performance of the other partys obligations that time for performance remains unchanged this provision does not however deal with the converse case where the performances are linked in time several situations may then arise this circumstance may in itself establish the obligees legitimate interest in rejecting earlier performance if earlier performance is thus rejected the obligees time of performance is unaffected if earlier performance is accepted with all due reservations as to the non performance involved the obligee may also reserve its rights as to its art 615 unidroit principles 192 time for performance if earlier performance is acceptable to the obligee it may at the same time decide whether or not to accept the consequences as regards its own obligations i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 b undertakes to deliver goods to a on 15 may and a to pay the price on 30 june b wishes to deliver the goods on 10 may and a has no legitimate interest in refusing such earlier performance this will however have no effect on the time agreed for payment of the price which was determined irrespective of the date of delivery 4 b undertakes to deliver goods to a on 15 may and a to pay the price on delivery if b tenders the goods on 10 may a depending on the circumstances may reject such earlier performance claiming that it is not in a position to pay at that date take delivery of the goods subject to observing the original deadline for payment of the price or decide to accept the goods and pay for them immediately 4 additional expenses entailed by earlier performance to be borne by the performing party if earlier performance is accepted it may entail additional expenses for the obligee in all cases such expenses are to be borne by the other party if earlier performance amounts to nonperformance the normal case those expenses will be part of the damages without prejudice to any other remedy available if earlier performance does not amount to nonperformance the obligee has been shown not to have any legitimate interest in rejecting the offer of earlier performance or has found that offer to be acceptable without reservation the obligee will only be entitled to those expenses i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a has no legitimate interest in refusing delivery of goods on 10 may instead of 15 may but some additional storage fees are payable for those five extra days those costs will be borne by b performance in general art 616 193 article 616 place of performance 1 if the place of performance is neither fixed by nor determinable from the contract a party is to perform a a monetary obligation at the obligees place of business b any other obligation at its own place of business 2 a party must bear any increase in the expenses incidental to performance which is caused by a change in its place of business subsequent to the conclusion of the contract comment 1 place of performance fixed by or determined from the contract when possible the place where an obligation is to be performed is often determined by an express term of the contract or is determinable from it it is obvious for instance that an obligation to build must be performed on the construction site and that an obligation to transport goods must be performed in accordance with the agreed route 2 need for suppletive rules rules are however needed to cover cases in which the contract is silent on the matter and circumstances do not indicate where performance should take place paragraph 1 provides two solutions the general rule is that a party is to perform its obligations at its own place of business the second rule is specific to monetary obligations where the converse solution applies namely that the obligor is to perform its obligations at the obligees place of business subject to the application of article 618 concerning payments by funds transfers these solutions may not be the most satisfactory in all cases but they do reflect the need for rules where the parties have not made any other arrangement or where the circumstances do not indicate otherwise art 616 unidroit principles 194 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a wishes some of its engineers to learn the language of country x where they will be employed for some time it agrees with b a language school for a series of intensive lessons if nothing else is stipulated the lessons are to take place at bs place of business see article 6161b 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 the language school sends its bill to a the cost of the lessons must in principle be paid at bs place of business see article 6161a 3 consequences of change in a partys place of business subsequent to conclusion of contract in view of the importance of the parties respective places of business for the application of paragraph 1 it is necessary to cater for the situation where a party changes its location after the conclusion of the contract a move which may involve additional expense for the performing party the rule established in paragraph 2 is that each party must bear any such increase of expenses occasioned by a change in its place of business it is moreover possible that a partys move may entail other inconvenience for the other party the obligation to act in good faith article 17 and the duty to cooperate article 513 will often impose on the moving party an obligation to inform the other party in due time so as to enable the latter to make such arrangements as may be necessary i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 a enters into a technical assistance agreement with b under the terms of which a undertakes to train ten of bs engineers for a period of two months on as premises the engineers are to be accommodated at a local hotel which offers very reasonable rates on account of as location in a rural area after the agreement has been concluded but before bs engineers arrive a notifies b that it has moved to the capital city where hotel rates are much higher irrespective of whether the initial costs of accommodation were to be paid by a or by b the additional costs will be borne by a 4 each year on 3 may a must pay royalties to b at bs place of business b moves to another country to which it takes some time eg two months for a payment to arrive a formerly gave its bank the transfer order on or about 15 april but from now on the order must be given towards the end of march at the latest if a performance in general art 617 195 wishes to avoid late payment b is under a duty to inform a of its new place of business in sufficient time to permit a to make the necessary arrangements for payment and b will bear the additional costs article 617 payment by cheque or other instrument 1 payment may be made in any form used in the ordinary course of business at the place for payment 2 however an obligee who accepts either by virtue of paragraph 1 or voluntarily a cheque any other order to pay or a promise to pay is presumed to do so only on condition that it will be honoured comment discharge of monetary obligations is frequently made by cheques or similar instruments or by transfers between financial institutions the problems involved have however very seldom been the subject of codification one notable exception being the uncitral model law on international credit transfers without attempting to provide a detailed regulation which would not be compatible with the very rapid evolution of techniques in this field articles 617 and 618 establish some basic principles which should be of assistance in regard to international payments 1 general rule regarding form of payment paragraph 1 allows for payment to be made in any form that is usual at the place for payment subject to the reservation contained in paragraph 2 the obligor may for instance pay in cash by cheque bankers draft a bill of exchange credit card or in any other form such as the newly developing electronic means of payment provided it chooses a mode that is usual at the place for payment ie normally at the obligees place of business in principle the obligee should be satisfied to receive payment in a form that is customary at its place of business art 618 unidroit principles 196 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a an importer in luxembourg receives a bill for goods bought from b a firm in central america and sends a eurocheque in payment b may reject this mode of payment if the banks in its country are not familiar with eurocheques 2 presumption that payment will be honoured a condition for acceptance paragraph 2 states the generally recognised principle according to which the obligees acceptance of an instrument that has to be honoured by a financial institution or another person a third person or the obligor itself is given only on condition that the instrument will actually be honoured the presumption can sometimes be overturned by usages there are for instance countries where delivery of instruments such as certified cheques bankers drafts and cashiers cheques is considered as being equivalent to payment by the obligor with the consequence that the risk of the banks insolvency is transferred to the obligee in such countries the rule in article 6172 would apply only to socalled personal cheques i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a a contractor must pay b a subcontractor for work completed by the latter on a building site a is experiencing a cash flow crisis as its client c is late in paying the first instalment due c has however given a a set of promissory notes up to the amount of its debt a offers to pay b by assigning a sufficient number of promissory notes if b accepts them in this case it probably does not have to do so as this is not a usual form of payment the effectiveness of the payment by a to b is conditional on cs honouring the promissory notes at maturity article 618 payment by funds transfer 1 unless the obligee has indicated a particular account payment may be made by a transfer to any of the financial institutions in which the obligee has made it known that it has an account performance in general art 618 197 2 in case of payment by a transfer the obligation of the obligor is discharged when the transfer to the obligees financial institution becomes effective comment 1 admissibility of funds transfers although the principle enunciated in article 616 that payment of a monetary obligation should be made at the obligees place of business still stands paragraph 1 of this article provides that it can also be made to one of the financial institutions in which the obligee has made it known that it keeps an account if however the obligee has indicated a particular account payment should then be made to that account naturally the obligee can also make it known that it does not wish payment to be made by transfer i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a shipyard established in country x repairs a ship belonging to b a company from country y and the bill is sent on a letterhead that mentions a bank account in country x and another in country y unless a states that payment has to be made to the account in country x or by a means other than a bank transfer b is entitled to make payment to the account in country y 2 time at which the obligors obligation is discharged by a funds transfer paragraph 2 of this article deals with the difficult question of determining when a payment by funds transfer is to be considered as completed ie when the obligors obligation is discharged this matter is of importance for example when deciding whether a payment was made in time or in the event of one of the banks not forwarding the funds it has received the choice of a satisfactory solution has been the centre of considerable controversy in many countries and international fora various possible times have been suggested such as that of the debiting of the account of the transferor the crediting to the account of the transferee bank the notice of credit to that account the decision of the transferee bank to accept a credit transfer the entry of credit to the transferees account the notice of credit to the transferee etc the matter is further complicated by the changes in the procedures for the transfer of funds entailed by new electronic transfer mechanisms art 619 unidroit principles 198 while bank practices may also differ from one case to another this uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to establish a definite rule providing when payment by a transfer is completed paragraph 2 of this article nevertheless serves a useful purpose in that it states the basic principle which will permit the finding of a more precise rule in each case such a payment will be effective when the transfer to the obligees financial institution becomes effective a solution founded on the notion that the institution acts as the obligees agent this means that the payment will not be effective simply because an order has been given to the transferors financial institution and the transferors account has been debited however payment is effective before the transferee is notified or credited with it by its financial institution although the precise moment at which payment to the obligees financial institution can be considered as being effective will depend on banking practices in the case concerned i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a a licensee gives its bank c a transfer order for usd 5000 royalties due to b a licensor who has an account with bank d c debits as account but fails to forward the funds to d and becomes bankrupt a has not effectively paid b article 619 currency of payment 1 if a monetary obligation is expressed in a currency other than that of the place for payment it may be paid by the obligor in the currency of the place for payment unless a that currency is not freely convertible or b the parties have agreed that payment should be made only in the currency in which the monetary obligation is expressed 2 if it is impossible for the obligor to make payment in the currency in which the monetary obligation is expressed the obligee may require payment in the currency of the place for payment even in the case referred to in paragraph 1b performance in general art 619 199 3 payment in the currency of the place for payment is to be made according to the applicable rate of exchange prevailing there when payment is due 4 however if the obligor has not paid at the time when payment is due the obligee may require payment according to the applicable rate of exchange prevailing either when payment is due or at the time of actual payment comment monetary obligations are usually expressed in a certain currency currency of account and payment must normally be made in the same currency however when the currency of the place for payment is different from the currency of account paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article provide for those cases where the obligor may or must make payment in the former currency 1 monetary obligation expressed in currency different from that of place for payment as a general rule the obligor is given the alternative of paying in the currency of the place for payment which may have definite practical advantages and if that currency is freely convertible this should cause no difficulty to the obligee if however the currency of the place for payment is not freely convertible the rule does not apply parties may also exclude the application of the rule by agreeing that payment is to be made only in the currency in which the monetary obligation is expressed effectivo clause if it has an interest in the payment actually being made in the currency of account the obligee should specify this in the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a company from country x receives an order for machinery from a buyer from country y the price being expressed in us dollars according to article 616 payment of that monetary obligation must in principle be made at the obligees place of business ie country x if the company from country y finds it more convenient it may pay the price in euro which is the currency of x see article 6191 2 the same company from country x frequently needs to buy from suppliers in country z certain parts to be included in the machines and has stipulated that the buyer from country y should art 619 unidroit principles 200 pay only in us dollars in this case payment may only be made in dollars see article 6191b 3 the same company from country x has a plant in country w where the machines will be assembled the contract provides that the buyer from country y has to pay the price to the firms subsidiary in country w since the currency of country w is not convertible payment may only be made in dollars see article 6191a 2 impossibility for obligor to make payment in currency in which obligation is expressed in some instances the obligor may find it impossible to make payment in the currency in which the obligation was expressed this may be the result of the application of exchange regulations or other mandatory rules or due to any other cause preventing the obligor from obtaining that currency in sufficient quantity paragraph 2 gives the obligee the option of requiring payment in the currency of the place for payment even if the contract contains an effectivo clause this is an additional option open to the obligee who may find it acceptable or even advantageous in the circumstances it does not preclude the exercise of any available remedy in the event of the obligors inability to pay in the currency of account amounting to a nonperformance of the contract eg damages i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a a swiss bank lends usd 1000000 to b to be reimbursed in geneva at maturity b is unable to find the necessary us dollars a which knows that b has deposits in swiss francs with another local bank may require payment in swiss francs even though the loan agreement stipulated that reimbursement was to be made only in us dollars see article 6192 3 determination of applicable rate of exchange paragraphs 3 and 4 deal with the problem of the determination of the rate of exchange to be chosen when payment is made in the currency of the place for payment rather than in a different currency stipulated in the contract this may occur when the obligor avails itself of paragraph 1 or the obligee the provisions of paragraph 2 performance in general art 6110 201 two widely accepted solutions are offered in normal cases the rate of exchange is that prevailing when payment is due if however the obligor is in default the obligee is given an option between the rate of exchange prevailing when payment was due or the rate at the time of actual payment the double reference to the applicable rate is justified by the fact that there may be different rates of exchange depending on the nature of the operation i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 4 a chooses to be reimbursed in swiss francs chf and payment which was due on 10 april actually takes place on 15 september the rate of exchange on 10 april was 2 swiss francs to 1 us dollar by 15 september it has become chf 215 to usd 1 a is entitled to apply the latter rate if the us dollar had depreciated rather than increased in value a would have chosen the rate applicable on 10 april article 6110 currency not expressed where a monetary obligation is not expressed in a particular currency payment must be made in the currency of the place where payment is to be made comment determining the currency of payment gives rise to a special problem if the contract does not state the currency in which a monetary obligation is due although such cases may be infrequent they do exist a contract may for example state that the price will be the current price or that it will be determined by a third person or that some expenses or costs will be reimbursed by one party to the other without specifying in which currency those sums are due the rule laid down in article 6110 is that in such situations payment must be made in the currency of the place where payment is to be made article 6110 is not concerned with the currency in which damages are to be assessed a matter dealt with in article 7412 in the context of nonperformance art 6111 unidroit principles 202 i l l u s t r a t i o n a a japanese client instructs its broker b to buy shares on the shanghai stock exchange if b pays for them in chinese yuan renminbi cny should a be billed in yuan renminbi or in japanese yen if a is to pay b in japan it will pay in yen article 6111 costs of performance each party shall bear the costs of performance of its obligations comment the performance of obligations often entails costs which may be of different kinds transportation costs in delivering goods bank commission in making a monetary transfer fees to be paid when applying for a permission etc in principle such costs are to be borne by the performing party other arrangements may of course be made by the parties and there is nothing to prevent the performing party from including those costs in advance in the price it quotes the rule set out in article 6111 applies in the absence of such arrangements the provision states who shall bear the costs not who shall pay them usually it will be the same party but there may be different situations for example where tax regulations place the burden of payment on a specific party in such cases if the person who has to pay is different from the person who must bear the costs under article 6111 the latter must reimburse the former i l l u s t r a t i o n a a consultant agrees to send five experts to perform an audit of bs company nothing is said concerning the experts travel expenses and a does not take those costs into account when determining its fees a may not add the travel expenses to the bill performance in general art 6112 203 article 6112 imputation of payments 1 an obligor owing several monetary obligations to the same obligee may specify at the time of payment the debt to which it intends the payment to be applied however the payment discharges first any expenses then interest due and finally the principal 2 if the obligor makes no such specif ication the obligee may within a reasonable time after payment declare to the obligor the obligation to which it imputes the payment provided that the obligation is due and undisputed 3 in the absence of imputation under paragraphs 1 or 2 payment is imputed to that obligation which satisfies one of the following criteria in the order indicated a an obligation which is due or which is the first to fall due b the obligation for which the obligee has least security c the obligation which is the most burdensome for the obligor d the obligation which has arisen first if none of the preceding criteria applies payment is imputed to all the obligations proportionally comment articles 6112 and 6113 deal with the problem of imputation of payments if an obligor owes several monetary obligations at the same time to the same obligee and makes a payment the amount of which is not sufficient to discharge all those debts the question arises of the debts to which that payment applies article 6112 offers the obligor the possibility of imputing its payment to a particular debt provided that any expenses and interest due are discharged before the principal in the absence of any imputation by the obligor this provision enables the obligee to impute the payment received although not to a disputed debt paragraph 3 lays down criteria which will govern in the absence of any imputation by either party art 6113 unidroit principles 204 i l l u s t r a t i o n a receives under separate contracts three loans each of usd 100000 from bank b payment of which is due on 31 december b receives usd 100000 from a on 2 january with the imprecise message reimbursement of the loan b pays little attention to the matter and at first does not react but three months later sues a for payment of the remaining usd 200000 and the parties disagree as to which of the loans had been reimbursed by the january payment b had similar security in each case but the interest rates were not the same 8 on the first loan 850 on the second and 9 on the third the january payment will be imputed to the third loan article 6113 imputation of nonmonetary obligations article 6112 applies with appropriate adaptations to the imputation of performance of nonmonetary obligations comment the problem of imputation of payments normally concerns monetary obligations but similar difficulties may sometimes occur in relation to obligations of a different nature article 6113 provides that the rules governing monetary obligations will apply with appropriate adaptations also to these cases i l l u s t r a t i o n a is performing construction work on several sites in an african country and through five separate and successive contracts with b purchases different quantities of cement all to be delivered in antwerp on the same date and to be loaded on the same ship the contracts are similar except that the third and fifth contracts stipulate very high liquidated damages in the event of late delivery on account of certain difficulties b can only deliver part of what it was supposed to upon delivery b is entitled to specify that the quantities delivered are to be imputed to the third and fifth contracts performance in general art 6114 205 article 6114 application for public permission where the law of a state requires a public permission affecting the validity of the contract or its performance and neither that law nor the circumstances indicate otherwise a if only one party has its place of business in that state that party shall take the measures necessary to obtain the permission b in any other case the party whose performance requires permission shall take the necessary measures comment if the validity or the performance of a contract is subject to compliance with public permission requirements several issues arise as to who has the burden of filing the application see article 6114 the time for filing see article 6115 the legal consequences of failure to obtain an administrative decision in due time see article 6116 and the rejection of the application see article 6117 1 scope of the permission requirement the principles do not deal with the relevance of public permission requirements what kind of public permission is required if any is to be determined under the applicable law including the rules of private international law courts tend to give effect only to the public permission requirements of the lex fori and sometimes to those prescribed by the lex contractus arbitral tribunals may enjoy wider discretion than courts in deciding which public permissions are relevant to the contract under the relevant conflict of laws rules public permission requirements of the law of other jurisdictions connected with the contract may also come into play see article 93 of ec regulation no 5932008 rome i article 112 of the 1994 interamerican convention on the law applicable to international contracts long arm statutes in some jurisdictions too may impose public permission requirements on licensees or subsidiaries of companies located abroad this article assumes that the requirements prescribed by the applicable law are to be observed art 6114 unidroit principles 206 a broad notion of public permission the term public permission is to be given a broad interpretation it includes all permission requirements established pursuant to a concern of a public nature such as health safety or particular trade policies it is irrelevant whether a required licence or permit is to be granted by a governmental or by a nongovernmental institution to which governments have delegated public authority for a specific purpose thus the authorisation of payments by a private bank pursuant to foreign exchange regulations is in the nature of a public permission for the purposes of this article b timing of public permission the provisions on public permissions refer primarily to those required by the applicable law or by a regulation in force at the time of the conclusion of the contract however these provisions may also apply to public permissions that may be introduced after the conclusion of the contract c public permission may affect the contract in whole or in part the provisions on public permissions apply both to those requirements affecting the contract as a whole and to those merely affecting individual terms of the contract however where the legal consequences of failing to obtain a public permission differ according to whether such permission affects the contract in whole or in part different rules are established see articles 61162 and 6117 d public permission may affect the validity or performance of a contract the absence of the required permission may affect the validity of a contract or render its performance impossible notwithstanding differences in the legal consequences of failing to obtain a required public permission the problems raised in connection with the application for or the obtaining of a public permission are the same as to the further consequences article 61172 provides that the rules on nonperformance apply to a situation where the refusal of a permission makes the performance of a contract impossible in whole or in part 2 duty to inform of the existence of a public permission requirement there is as a rule no duty to provide information concerning the requirement to obtain a public permission however the existence of performance in general art 6114 207 such a requirement must be disclosed by the party upon whom rests the burden of obtaining a public permission when such permission is required under rules which are not generally accessible thus the overriding principle of good faith and fair dealing see article 17 may require the party whose place of business is located in the state requiring a public permission to inform the other party of the existence of that requirement failure to do so may lead a court to disregard the permission requirement altogether or to conclude that the party who failed to communicate the existence of the requirement implicitly guaranteed that it would be obtained 3 which party is bound to take measures to obtain a public permission a party with place of business in state requiring public permission the rule set out in subparagraph a of this article which places the burden to apply on the party who has its place of business in the state which requires the relevant public permission reflects current international trade practices it is that party who is in the best position to apply promptly for a public permission since it is probably more familiar with the application requirements and procedures if a party needs further information from the other to file an application eg information relating to the final destination of the goods or information as to the purpose or subject matter of the contract the other party must furnish such information pursuant to the duty of cooperation see article 513 should that party not furnish such information it may not rely on the obligation of the first party this duty to cooperate with the other party applies even if the contract stipulates that one of the parties bears the burden of applying for a public permission thus if the parties have incorporated in their contract the term ex works which imposes farreaching obligations on the buyer the seller is nevertheless bound to render the buyer at the latters request risk and expense every assistance in obtaining any export licence or other official authorisation necessary for the export of the goods incoterms 2010 a 2 see also b 2 b party whose performance requires public permission subparagraph b of this article contemplates those cases where none of the parties has a place of business in the state requiring the permission it also envisions a contract which is truly international notwithstanding the fact that both parties have their places of business in that state in either case the party whose performance requires the art 6114 unidroit principles 208 public permission is bound to take the necessary measures to obtain such a permission i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a contractor whose place of business is located in country x sells a plant on a turnkey basis to b whose place of business is located in country y acceptance is to take place after performance tests in country y on the one hand a has to apply for all public permissions required in country x as well as for permissions in third countries transit subdeliveries on the other b has to apply for import licences as well as for all other permissions relating to the site the use of local services and the technology imported into country y a is also bound to furnish the information and documentation needed by b to obtain import licences and other permissions related to bs performance a is not responsible for applying for public permissions in country y unless this is agreed in the contract or is required explicitly or implicitly by the applicable law or the circumstances of the case eg the applicable law may require certain technical permits in country y to be applied for by the licensor c suppletory nature of provisions on public permissions the purpose of this article is to determine the party who must apply for a public permission in those cases where it is not clear who is to bear that burden it is a suppletory rule to be applied when neither the contract nor the law requiring the permission or the circumstances specify which party is under an obligation to apply for the required public permission i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the law of country x subordinates the granting of an export licence for computers to a sworn declaration indicating the country where the computers will ultimately be sent however neither the contract nor the law of country x indicates which party bears the burden of applying for a licence since it is reasonable to suppose that only the buyer knows what it plans to do with the computers the policy behind the rule imposing the permission requirement leads to the conclusion that it is the buyer who has to file the application performance in general art 6115 209 4 nature of obligation to take the necessary measures the party who has to apply for the permission must take the necessary measures to obtain such permission but is not responsible for the outcome of the application that party is bound to exhaust available local remedies to obtain the permission provided that they have a good chance of success and that resorting to local remedies appears reasonable in view of the circumstances of the case eg the value of the transaction time constraints which measures have to be taken depends on the relevant regulations and the procedural mechanisms available in the state where the permission is to be granted the obligation is in the nature of an obligation of best efforts see article 5142 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 a a principal whose place of business is in country x enters into a contract with b a selfemployed agent whose place of business is in country y b who has no authority to conclude contracts is to represent a in countries y and z among other duties b must exhibit as goods at a fair which is to take place in country z b must apply for all permissions which are required to undertake these professional activities in countries y and z bs duty to take necessary measures includes that of applying for public permissions required to import as goods temporarily into countries y and z as well as any other public permission that would enable b to participate in the fair however unless otherwise agreed b is not required to apply for public permissions required for goods imported through b by customers located in countries y and z article 6115 procedure in applying for permission 1 the party required to take the measures necessary to obtain the permission shall do so without undue delay and shall bear any expenses incurred 2 that party shall whenever appropriate give the other party notice of the grant or refusal of such permission without undue delay art 6115 unidroit principles 210 comment 1 time for filing an application the party under an obligation to obtain a public permission must take action immediately after the conclusion of the contract and pursue this action as necessary under the circumstances 2 expenses according to article 6111 each party shall bear the costs of performance of its obligations this rule has been restated in paragraph 1 of this article for the sake of clarity 3 duty to give prompt notice of the grant or refusal of the permission the parties to the contract need to know as soon as possible whether the permission can be obtained accordingly paragraph 2 of this article provides that the party required to take the necessary measures must inform the other of the outcome of the application this duty of information extends to other relevant facts such as for example the timing and outcome of the application whether a refusal is subject to appeal and whether an appeal is to be lodged 4 duty to give notice whenever appropriate the appropriateness of giving notice of the grant or refusal refers to the need to give notice and the manner of providing it the necessity of giving notice obviously exists where such notice is required by law but may also be inferred from the mere fact that a permission requirement is referred to in the contract the appropriateness of the duty to give notice is also related to the relevance of the information to be provided accordingly the applying party is not bound to inform the other party of the outcome of that application in cases where the latter party obtains the information from the granting authority or where applications for permissions are regularly granted the fact that the permission is contrary to normal practice refused in a given case makes the obligation to inform more compelling this article does not establish particular requirements concerning the formalities relating to the communication see article 110 performance in general art 6115 211 5 consequences of the failure to inform failure to provide information regarding the grant or refusal of the permission amounts to nonperformance accordingly the general consequences of nonperformance as set forth in chapter 7 apply the duty to give notice of the grant of the public permission is a contractual obligation arising at the time the contract comes into existence the duty to give notice of the refusal of the permission is part of the duty to take the necessary measures to obtain the permission under article 6114 see comment 4 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a whose place of business is in country x and b a contractor enter into a contract for the construction of a plant in country x the parties agree that b is not bound to begin the construction and as advance payments are not due until the grant of a permission by the authorities of country x a applies for and obtains the permission but fails to inform b that the permission has been granted two months later b learns through inquiries with the authorities of country x that the permission has been granted and begins work on the construction of the plant although the parties had agreed that their performances were due as of the time of the granting of the permission as failure to inform b that the permission has been granted precludes a from relying on bs failure to perform as of that date see article 712 thus the contractual period begins to run for b as from when it learns of the granting of the permission moreover b may also claim damages if it is able to establish for example damage resulting from failure to use its production capacity additional costs arising from storing raw materials during that twomonth period etc see article 741 et seq a who from the very beginning had notice of the grant of the permission must observe the original date of its performance as provided for in the contract if a fails to make an advance payment due four weeks after the granting of the permission a must pay interest as from that date 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the proper authority simultaneously informs a and b that the permission has been granted b may not avail itself of as failure to inform in order to postpone its performance nor is it entitled to damages for as failure to inform art 6116 unidroit principles 212 article 6116 permission neither granted nor refused 1 if notwithstanding the fact that the party responsible has taken all measures re quired permission is neither granted nor refused within an agreed period or where no period has been agreed within a reasonable time from the conclusion of the contract either party is entitled to terminate the contract 2 where the permission affects some terms only paragraph 1 does not apply if having regard to the circumstances it is reason able to uphold the remaining contract even if the permission is refused comment whereas articles 6114 and 6115 are concerned with the duties of the contracting parties articles 6116 and 6117 deal with the legal consequences in cases respectively where there has been no decision on the application within a given period or where the public permission has been refused 1 no decision taken as regards the permission paragraph 1 of this article deals with the nothing happens situation that is to say a situation where permission has neither been granted nor refused within the agreed period or where no period has been agreed within a reasonable time from the conclusion of the contract the reasons for the absence of a pronouncement may vary for example the slow pace of processing the application a pending appeal etc in any event there is no longer any reason to keep the parties waiting and either party is entitled to terminate the contract 2 termination of the contract remedies other than termination may be appropriate depending on the legal role played by the permission in the creation of the contractual obligations this is in particular the case where the granting of the performance in general art 6116 213 public permission is a condition for the validity of the contract since in the absence of the permission either party may simply disregard the contract the reason why this article provides also in these cases for the termination of the contract is that the parties are with a view to obtaining the permission under a number of obligations which cannot be allowed to exist indefinitely the entitlement of the party responsible for obtaining the permission to terminate the contract under this article is conditional on that partys having taken the necessary measures to that effect i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a situated in country x sells rifles to b for resale by b in the hunting season starting in four months the validity of the sale is subject to a public permission to be granted by the authorities of country x no period is agreed for obtaining that permission notwithstanding the fact that a takes all the necessary measures to obtain the permission after three months no decision has yet been taken on as application either party may terminate the contract the termination envisaged under this article has no consequences for the expenses so far incurred by the parties for the purpose of obtaining the permission the expenses will be borne by the party who has assumed the risk of not obtaining the permission 3 permission affecting individual terms only where the permission affects some terms only of the contract paragraph 2 of this article excludes the right of termination in cases where even if the permission had been refused it would according to article 61171 nevertheless be reasonable to uphold the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a situated in country x enters into a contract with b which contains a penalty clause for delay the validity of which is subject to a public permission to be granted by the authorities of country x notwithstanding the fact that a takes all the necessary measures to obtain the permission time continues to pass without any decision being taken it would be reasonable in the circumstances to uphold the contract even if the permission were to have been refused neither party may terminate the contract art 6117 unidroit principles 214 article 6117 permission refused 1 the refusal of a permission affecting the validity of the contract renders the contract void if the refusal affects the validity of some terms only only such terms are void if having regard to the circumstances it is reasonable to uphold the remaining contract 2 where the refusal of a permission renders the performance of the contract impossible in whole or in part the rules on non performance apply comment 1 application for permission rejected this article contemplates the situation where the application for a permission is expressly refused the nature of the obligation imposed on the responsible party with respect to the application for the permission is such that a refusal under this article is one which is not subject to an appeal which has a reasonable prospect of success see comment 4 on article 6114 moreover means of recourse against the refusal need not be exhausted whenever a final decision on the permission would be taken only after the time at which the contract could meaningfully be performed 2 legal consequences of a refusal of permission the consequences of a refusal to grant the permission vary depending on whether the permission affects the validity of the contract or its performance a refusal of permission affecting validity of the contract where the permission affects the validity of the whole contract a refusal renders the whole contract void ie the contract is considered as never having come into being performance in general art 6117 215 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a situated in country x enters into a contract with b the validity of which is subject to a public permission to be granted by the authorities of country x notwithstanding the fact that a takes all the necessary measures to obtain the permission as application is refused the contract is considered never to have come into existence where on the other hand a refusal affects the validity of some terms only of the contract only such terms are void while the remaining part of the contract may be upheld provided that such a result is reasonable in the circumstances i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a situated in country x enters into a contract with b which contains a penalty clause for delay the validity of which is subject to a public permission to be granted by the authorities of country x notwithstanding the fact that a takes all the necessary measures to obtain the permission as application is refused if it is reasonable in the circumstances the contract will be upheld without the penalty clause b refusal rendering performance of the contract impossible if the refusal of the permission renders the performance impossible in whole or in part paragraph 2 of this article refers to the rules on nonperformance embodied in chapter 7 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 under a contract entered into with b a owes b usd 100000 the transfer of the sum from country x where a is situated to bs bank account in country y is subject to a permission by the central bank of country x notwithstanding the fact that a takes all the necessary measures to obtain the permission as application is refused the refusal of the permission renders it impossible for a to pay b the consequences of as nonperformance are determined in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 the refusal of the permission may render the performance of a party impossible only in the state imposing the permission requirement while it may be possible for that party to perform the same obligation elsewhere in such cases the general principle of good faith and fair dealing see article 17 will prevent that party from relying on the refusal of the permission as an excuse for nonperformance art 6117 unidroit principles 216 i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 except that a has sufficient funds to pay b in country z where no such permission requirement exists a may not rely on the refusal of the permission by the authorities of country x as an excuse for not paying b 217 section 2 hardship article 621 contract to be observed where the performance of a contract becomes more onerous for one of the parties that party is nevertheless bound to perform its obligations subject to the following provisions on hardship comment 1 binding character of the contract the general rule the purpose of this article is to make it clear that as a consequence of the general principle of the binding character of the contract see article 13 performance must be rendered as long as it is possible and regardless of the burden it may impose on the performing party in other words even if a party experiences heavy losses instead of the expected profits or the performance has become meaningless for that party the terms of the contract must nevertheless be respected i l l u s t r a t i o n a a forwarding agent enters into a twoyear shipping contract with b a carrier under the contract b is bound to ship certain goods from country x to country y at a fixed rate on a monthly basis throughout the twoyear period two years later alleging a substantial increase in the price of fuel in the aftermath of a political crisis in the region b requests a five per cent increase in the rate b is not entitled to such an increase because b bears the risk of its performance becoming more onerous 2 change in circumstances relevant only in exceptional cases the principle of the binding character of the contract is not however an absolute one when supervening circumstances are such that they lead to a fundamental alteration of the equilibrium of the contract they create an exceptional situation referred to in the principles as hardship and dealt with in the following articles of this section art 622 unidroit principles 218 the phenomenon of hardship has been acknowledged by various legal systems under the guise of other concepts such as frustration of purpose wegfall der geschftsgrundlage imprvision eccessiva onerosit sopravvenuta etc the term hardship was chosen because it is widely known in international trade practice as confirmed by the inclusion in many international contracts of socalled hardship clauses article 622 definition of hardship there is hardship where the occurrence of events fundamentally alters the equilibrium of the contract either because the cost of a partys performance has increased or because the value of the performance a party receives has diminished and a the events occur or become known to the disadvantaged party after the conclusion of the contract b the events could not reasonably have been taken into account by the disadvantaged party at the time of the conclusion of the contract c the events are beyond the control of the disadvantaged party and d the risk of the events was not assumed by the disadvantaged party comment 1 hardship defined this article defines hardship as a situation where the occurrence of events fundamentally alters the equilibrium of the contract provided that those events meet the requirements which are laid down in sub paragraphs a to d 2 fundamental alteration of equilibrium of the contract since the general principle is that a change in circumstances does not affect the obligation to perform see article 621 it follows that hardship art 622 219 hardship may not be invoked unless the alteration of the equilibrium of the contract is fundamental whether an alteration is fundamental in a given case will of course depend upon the circumstances i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 in september 1989 a a dealer in electronic goods situated in the former german democratic republic purchases stocks from b situated in country x also a former socialist country the goods are to be delivered by b in december 1990 in november 1990 a informs b that the goods are no longer of any use to it claiming that after the unification of the german democratic republic and the federal republic of germany and the opening of the former german democratic republic to the international market there is no longer any market for such goods imported from country x unless the circumstances indicate otherwise a is entitled to invoke hardship a increase in cost of performance in practice a fundamental alteration in the equilibrium of the contract may manifest itself in two different but related ways the first is characterised by a substantial increase in the cost for one party of performing its obligation this party will normally be the one who is to perform the nonmonetary obligation the substantial increase in the cost may for instance be due to a dramatic rise in the price of the raw materials necessary for the production of the goods or the rendering of the services or to the introduction of new safety regulations requiring far more expensive production procedures b decrease in value of the performance received by one party the second manifestation of hardship is characterised by a substantial decrease in the value of the performance received by one party including cases where the performance no longer has any value at all for the receiving party the performance may relate either to a monetary or a nonmonetary obligation the substantial decrease in the value or the total loss of any value of the performance may be due either to drastic changes in market conditions eg the effect of a dramatic increase in inflation on a contractually agreed price or the frustration of the purpose for which the performance was required eg the effect of a prohibition to build on a plot of land acquired for building purposes or the effect of an export embargo on goods acquired with a view to their subsequent export naturally the decrease in value of the performance must be capable of objective measurement a mere change in the personal opinion of the receiving party as to the value of the performance is of no relevance as art 622 unidroit principles 220 to the frustration of the purpose of the performance this can only be taken into account when the purpose in question was known or at least ought to have been known to both parties 3 additional requirements for hardship to arise a events occur or become known after conclusion of the contract according to subparagraph a of this article the events causing hardship must take place or become known to the disadvantaged party after the conclusion of the contract if that party had known of those events when entering into the contract it would have been able to take them into account at that time in such a case that party may not subsequently rely on hardship b events could not reasonably have been taken into account by disadvantaged party even if the change in circumstances occurs after the conclusion of the contract subparagraph b of this article makes it clear that such circumstances cannot cause hardship if they could reasonably have been taken into account by the disadvantaged party at the time the contract was concluded i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a agrees to supply b with crude oil from country x at a fixed price for the next five years notwithstanding the acute political tensions in the region two years after the conclusion of the contract a war erupts between contending factions in neighbouring countries the war results in a world energy crisis and oil prices increase drastically a is not entitled to invoke hardship because such a rise in the price of crude oil was not unforeseeable sometimes the change in circumstances is gradual but the final result of those gradual changes may constitute a case of hardship if the change began before the contract was concluded hardship will not arise unless the pace of change increases dramatically during the life of the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 in a sales contract between a and b the price is expressed in the currency of country x a currency the value of which was already depreciating slowly against other major currencies before the conclusion of the contract one month thereafter a political crisis in country x leads to a massive devaluation of its currency of the order hardship art 622 221 of 80 unless the circumstances indicate otherwise this constitutes a case of hardship since such a dramatic acceleration of the loss of value of the currency of country x was not foreseeable c events beyond the control of disadvantaged party under subparagraph c of this article a case of hardship can only arise if the events causing the hardship are beyond the control of the disadvantaged party d risks must not have been assumed by disadvantaged party under subparagraph d there can be no hardship if the disadvan taged party had assumed the risk of the change in circumstances the word assumption makes it clear that the risks need not have been taken over expressly but that this may follow from the very nature of the contract a party who enters into a speculative transaction is deemed to accept a certain degree of risk even though it may not have been fully aware of that risk at the time it entered into the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a an insurance company specialised in the insurance of shipping risks requests an additional premium from those of its customers who have contracts which include the risks of war and civil insurrection so as to meet the substantially greater risk to which it is exposed following upon the simultaneous outbreak of war and civil insurrection in three countries in the same region a is not entitled to such an adaptation of the contract since by the war and civil insurrection clauses insurance companies assume these risks even if three countries are affected at the same time 4 hardship relevant only to performance not yet rendered by its very nature hardship can only become of relevance with respect to performances still to be rendered once a party has performed it is no longer entitled to invoke a substantial increase in the costs of its performance or a substantial decrease in the value of the performance it receives as a consequence of a change in circumstances which occurs after such performance if the fundamental alteration in the equilibrium of the contract occurs at a time when performance has been only partially rendered hardship can be of relevance only to the parts of the performance still to be rendered art 622 unidroit principles 222 i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a enters into a contract with b a waste disposal company in country x for the purpose of arranging the storage of its waste the contract provides for a fouryear term and a fixed price per ton of waste two years after the conclusion of the contract the environ mental movement in country x gains ground and the government of country x prescribes prices for storing waste which are ten times higher than before b may successfully invoke hardship only with respect to the two remaining years of the life of the contract 5 hardship normally relevant to longterm contracts although this article does not expressly exclude the possibility of hardship being invoked in respect of other kinds of contract hardship will normally be of relevance to longterm contracts 6 hardship and force majeure in view of the definitions of hardship in this article and force majeure in article 717 under the principles there may be factual situations which can at the same time be considered as cases of hardship and of force majeure if this is the case it is for the party affected by these events to decide which remedy to pursue if it invokes force majeure it is with a view to its nonperformance being excused if on the other hand a party invokes hardship this is in the first instance for the purpose of renegotiating the terms of the contract so as to allow the contract to be kept alive although on revised terms 7 hardship and contract practice the definition of hardship in this article is necessarily of a rather general character international commercial contracts often contain much more precise and elaborate provisions in this regard the parties may therefore find it appropriate to adapt the content of this article so as to take account of the particular features of the specific transaction hardship art 623 223 article 623 effects of hardship 1 in case of hardship the disadvantaged party is entitled to request renegotiations the request shall be made without undue delay and shall indicate the grounds on which it is based 2 the request for renegotiation does not in itself entitle the disadvantaged party to withhold performance 3 upon failure to reach agreement within a reasonable time either party may resort to the court 4 if the court finds hardship it may if reasonable a terminate the contract at a date and on terms to be fixed or b adapt the contract with a view to restoring its equilibrium comment 1 disadvantaged party entitled to request renegotiations since hardship consists in a fundamental alteration of the equilibrium of the contract paragraph 1 of this article in the first instance entitles the disadvantaged party to request the other party to enter into renegotiation of the original terms of the contract with a view to adapting them to the changed circumstances i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a construction company situated in country x enters into a lump sum contract with b a governmental agency for the erection of a plant in country y most of the sophisticated machinery has to be imported from abroad due to an unexpected devaluation of the currency of country y which is the currency of payment the cost of the machinery increases dramatically a is entitled to request b to renegotiate the original contract price so as to adapt it to the changed circumstances a request for renegotiations is not admissible where the contract itself already incorporates a clause providing for the automatic art 623 unidroit principles 224 adaptation of the contract eg a clause providing for automatic indexation of the price if certain events occur i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the contract contains a price indexation clause relating to variations in the cost of materials and labour a is not entitled to request a renegotiation of the price however even in such a case renegotiation on account of hardship would not be precluded if the adaptation clause incorporated in the contract did not contemplate the events giving rise to hardship i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 except that the substantial increase in as costs is due to the adoption of new safety regulations in country y a is entitled to request b to renegotiate the original contract price so as to adapt it to the changed circumstances 2 request for renegotiations without undue delay the request for renegotiations must be made as quickly as possible after the time at which hardship is alleged to have occurred paragraph 1 the precise time for requesting renegotiations will depend upon the circumstances of the case it may for instance be longer when the change in circumstances takes place gradually see comment 3b on article 622 the disadvantaged party does not lose its right to request renegotiations simply because it fails to act without undue delay the delay in making the request may however affect the finding as to whether hardship actually existed and if so its consequences for the contract 3 grounds for request for renegotiations paragraph 1 of this article also imposes on the disadvantaged party a duty to indicate the grounds on which the request for renegotiations is based so as to permit the other party better to assess whether or not the request for renegotiations is justified an incomplete request is to be considered as not being raised in time unless the grounds of the alleged hardship are so obvious that they need not be spelt out in the request failure to set forth the grounds on which the request for renegotiations is based may have similar effects to those resulting from undue delay in making the request see comment 2 on this article hardship art 623 225 4 request for renegotiations and withholding of performance paragraph 2 of this article provides that the request for renego tiations does not of itself entitle the disadvantaged party to withhold performance the reason for this lies in the exceptional character of hardship and in the risk of possible abuses of the remedy withholding performance may be justified only in extraordinary circumstances i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a enters into a contract with b for the construction of a plant the plant is to be built in country x which adopts new safety regu lations after the conclusion of the contract the new regulations require additional apparatus and thereby fundamentally alter the equilibrium of the contract making as performance substantially more onerous a is entitled to request renegotiations and may with hold performance in view of the time it needs to implement the new safety regulations but it may also withhold the delivery of the additional apparatus for as long as the corresponding price adaptation is not agreed 5 renegotiations in good faith although nothing is said in this article to that effect both the request for renegotiations by the disadvantaged party and the conduct of both parties during the renegotiation process are subject to the general principle of good faith and fair dealing see article 17 and to the duty of co operation see article 513 thus the disadvantaged party must honestly believe that a case of hardship actually exists and not request renegotiations as a purely tactical manoeuvre similarly once the request has been made both parties must conduct the renegotiations in a constructive manner in particular by refraining from any form of obstruction and by providing all the necessary information 6 resort to the court upon failure to reach an agreement if the parties fail to reach agreement on the adaptation of the contract to the changed circumstances within a reasonable time paragraph 3 of this article authorises either party to resort to the court such a situation may arise either because the nondisadvantaged party completely ignored the request for renegotiations or because the renegotiations although conducted by both parties in good faith did not have a positive outcome how long a party must wait before resorting to the court will depend on the complexity of the issues to be settled and the particular circumstances of the case art 623 unidroit principles 226 7 court measures in case of hardship according to paragraph 4 of this article a court which finds that a hardship situation exists may react in a number of different ways a first possibility is for it to terminate the contract however since termination in this case does not depend on nonperformance by one of the parties its effects on the performances already rendered might be different from those provided for by the rules governing termination in general see articles 731 et seq accordingly paragraph 4a provides that termination shall take place at a date and on terms to be fixed by the court another possibility would be for a court to adapt the contract with a view to restoring its equilibrium paragraph 4b in so doing the court will seek to make a fair distribution of the losses between the parties this may or may not depending on the nature of the hardship involve a price adaptation however if it does the adaptation will not necessarily reflect in full the loss entailed by the change in circumstances since the court will for instance have to consider the extent to which one of the parties has taken a risk and the extent to which the party entitled to receive a performance may still benefit from that performance paragraph 4 of this article expressly states that the court may terminate or adapt the contract only when this is reasonable the circumstances may even be such that neither termination nor adaptation is appropriate and in consequence the only reasonable solution will be for the court either to direct the parties to resume negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on the adaptation of the contract or to confirm the terms of the contract as they stand i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a an exporter undertakes to supply b an importer in country x with beer for three years two years after the conclusion of the contract new legislation is introduced in country x prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks b immediately invokes hardship and requests a to renegotiate the contract a recognises that hardship has occurred but refuses to accept the modifications of the contract proposed by b after one month of fruitless discussions b resorts to the court if b has the possibility to sell the beer in a neighbouring country although at a substantially lower price the court may decide to uphold the contract but to reduce the agreed price if on the contrary b has no such possibility it may be reasonable for the court to terminate the contract at the same time however requiring b to pay a for the last consignment still en route 227 chapter 7 nonperformance section 1 nonperformance in general article 711 nonperformance defined nonperformance is failure by a party to perform any of its obligations under the contract including defective performance or late performance comment this article defines nonperformance for the purpose of the principles particular attention should be drawn to two features of the definition the first is that nonperformance is defined so as to include all forms of defective performance as well as complete failure to perform thus it is nonperformance for a builder to erect a building which is partly in accordance with the contract and partly defective or to complete the building late the second feature is that for the purposes of the principles the concept of nonperformance includes both nonexcused and excused nonperformance nonperformance may be excused by reason of the conduct of the other party to the contract see articles 712 interference by the other party and 713 withholding performance and comments or because of unexpected external events see article 717 force majeure and comment a party is not entitled to claim damages or specific performance for an excused nonperformance of the other party but a party who has not received performance will as a rule be entitled to terminate the contract whether or not the nonperformance is excused see article 731 et seq and comment art 712 unidroit principles 228 there is no general provision dealing with cumulation of remedies the assumption underlying the principles is that all remedies which are not logically inconsistent may be cumulated so in general a party who successfully insists on performance will not be entitled to damages but there is no reason why a party may not terminate a contract for non excused nonperformance and simultaneously claim damages see articles 725 change of remedy 735 effects of termination in general and 741 right to damages article 712 interference by the other party a party may not rely on the non performance of the other party to the extent that such nonperformance was caused by the first partys act or omission or by another event for which the first party bears the risk comment 1 nonperformance caused by act or omission of the party alleging nonperformance this article can be regarded as providing two excuses for non performance however conceptually it goes further than this when the article applies the relevant conduct does not become excused non performance but loses the quality of nonperformance altogether it follows for instance that the other party will not be able to terminate for nonperformance two distinct situations are contemplated in the first one party is unable to perform either wholly or in part because the other party has done something which makes performance in whole or in part impossible i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a agrees to perform building work on bs land beginning on 1 february if b locks the gate to the land and does not allow a entry b cannot complain that a has failed to begin work bs conduct will often amount to nonexcused nonperformance either because of an express provision entitling a to access the land or because bs conduct infringes the obligations of good faith and cooperation nonperformance in general art 713 229 this result does not however depend on bs nonperformance being nonexcused the result will be the same where bs nonperformance is excused for instance because access to the land is barred by strikers the principles contemplate the possibility that one partys inter ference result only in a partial impediment to performance by the other party in such cases it will be necessary to decide the extent to which nonperformance was caused by the first partys interference and that to which it was caused by other factors 2 nonperformance caused by event for which party alleging non performance bears the risk another possibility is that nonperformance may result from an event the risk of which is expressly or impliedly allocated by the contract to the party alleging nonperformance i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a a builder concludes a construction contract to be performed on the premises of b who already has many buildings on those premises which are the subject of an insurance policy covering any damage to the buildings if the parties agree that the risk of accidental damage is to fall on b as the person insured there would normally be no reason to reject the parties allocation of risk since risks of this kind are normally covered by insurance even therefore if a fire were to be caused by as negligence the risk may be allocated to b although it would clearly need more explicit language to carry this result than would be the case if the fire which destroyed the building were the fault of neither party article 713 withholding performance 1 where the parties are to perform simultaneously either party may withhold performance until the other party tenders its performance 2 where the parties are to perform consecutively the party that is to perform later may withhold its performance until the first party has performed art 714 unidroit principles 230 comment this article must be read together with article 614 order of performance this article is concerned with remedies and corresponds in effect to the civil law concept of exceptio non adimpleti contractus i l l u s t r a t i o n a agrees to sell b a thousand tons of white wheat payment to be made by confirmed letter of credit opened on a bank from country x a is not obliged to ship the goods unless and until b opens the letter of credit in conformity with its contractual obligations the text does not explicitly address the question which arises where one party performs in part but does not perform completely in such a case the party entitled to receive performance may be entitled to withhold performance but only where in normal circumstances this is consonant with good faith and fair dealing see article 17 article 714 cure by nonperforming party 1 the nonperforming party may at its own expense cure any nonperformance provided that a without undue delay it gives notice indicating the proposed manner and timing of the cure b cure is appropriate in the circum stances c the aggrieved party has no legitimate interest in refusing cure and d cure is effected promptly 2 the right to cure is not precluded by notice of termination 3 upon effective notice of cure rights of the aggrieved party that are inconsistent with the nonperforming partys performance are suspended until the time for cure has expired 4 the aggrieved party may withhold performance pending cure nonperformance in general art 714 231 5 notwithstanding cure the aggrieved party retains the right to claim damages for delay as well as for any harm caused or not prevented by the cure comment 1 general principle paragraph 1 of this article provides that if certain conditions are met the nonperforming party may cure by correcting the non performance in effect by meeting these conditions the nonperforming party is able to extend the time for performance for a brief period beyond that stipulated in the contract unless timely performance is required by the agreement or the circumstances this article thus favours the preservation of the contract it also reflects the policy of minimising economic waste as incorporated in article 748 mitigation of harm and the basic principle of good faith stated in article 17 this article is related to the cure provisions contained in articles 37 and 48 cisg and in some domestic laws governing contracts and sales even many of those legal systems that do not have a rule permitting cure would normally take a reasonable offer of cure into account in assessing damages 2 notice of cure cure may be effected only after the nonperforming party gives notice of cure the notice must be reasonable with regard to its timing and content as well as to the manner in which it is communicated notice of cure must be given without undue delay after the non performing party learns of the nonperformance to the extent information is then available the notice must indicate how cure is to be effected and when notice must also be communicated to the aggrieved party in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances notice of cure is considered to be effective when the requirements of paragraph 1a c have been met 3 appropriateness of cure whether cure is appropriate in the circumstances depends on whether it is reasonable given the nature of the contract to permit the non performing party to make another attempt at performance as indicated in paragraph 2 cure is not precluded merely because the failure to perform amounts to a fundamental nonperformance the factors to be art 714 unidroit principles 232 considered in determining the appropriateness of cure include whether the proposed cure promises to be successful in resolving the problem and whether the necessary or probable delay in effecting cure would be unreasonable or would itself constitute a fundamental nonperformance however the right to cure is not defeated by the fact that the aggrieved party subsequently changes its position if the nonperforming party gives effective notice of cure the aggrieved partys right to change position is suspended nonetheless the situation may be different if the aggrieved party has changed position before receiving notice of cure 4 the aggrieved partys interest the nonperforming party may not cure if the aggrieved party can demonstrate a legitimate interest in refusing cure however if notice of cure is properly given and if cure is appropriate in the circumstances it is presumed that the nonperforming party should be permitted to cure a legitimate interest may arise for example if it is likely that when attempting cure the nonperforming party will cause damage to person or property on the other hand a legitimate interest is not present if on the basis of the nonperformance the aggrieved party has simply decided that it does not wish to continue contractual relations i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a agrees to construct a road on bs property when the road is complete b discovers that the road grade is steeper than the contract permits b also discovers that during construction as trucks caused damage to bs timber a gives notice of cure to regrade the road even if cure would otherwise be appropriate in the circumstances bs desire to prevent further damage to the timber may provide a legitimate interest for refusing cure 5 timing of cure cure must be effected promptly after notice of cure is given time is of the essence in the exercise of the right to cure the nonperforming party is not permitted to lock the aggrieved party into an extended waiting period the lack of inconvenience on the part of the aggrieved party does not justify the nonperforming party in delaying cure 6 proper forms of cure cure may include repair and replacement as well as any other activities that remedy the nonperformance and give to the aggrieved party all that it is entitled to expect under the contract repairs constitute cure only when they leave no evidence of the prior nonperformance nonperformance in general art 714 233 and do not threaten the value or the quality of the product as a whole it is left to the courts to determine the number of times the nonperforming party may attempt a cure i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a agrees to install an assembly line for high temperature enamel painting in bs factory the motors are installed with insufficient lubricant and as a result lock up after a few hours of operation a replaces the motors in a timely fashion but refuses to examine and test the rest of the equipment to ensure that other parts of the line have not been damaged a has not effectively cured 7 suspension of other remedies when the nonperforming party has given effective notice of cure the aggrieved party may in accordance with paragraph 4 withhold its own performance but pursuant to paragraph 3 may not exercise any remedies inconsistent with the nonperforming partys right to cure until it becomes clear that a timely and proper cure has not been or will not be effected inconsistent remedies include giving notice of termination entering into replacement transactions and seeking damages or restitution 8 effect of a notice of termination if the aggrieved party has rightfully terminated the contract pursuant to articles 7311 and 7321 the effects of termination see articles 735 736 and 737 are also suspended by an effective notice of cure if the nonperformance is cured the notice of termination is inoperative on the other hand termination takes effect if the time for cure has expired and any fundamental nonperformance has not been cured 9 right of aggrieved party to damages under paragraph 5 of this article even a nonperforming party who successfully cures is liable for any harm that before cure was occasioned by the nonperformance as well as for any additional harm art 715 unidroit principles 234 caused by the cure itself or by the delay or for any harm which the cure does not prevent the principle of full compensation for damage suffered as provided in article 742 is fundamental to the principles 10 the aggrieved partys obligations the decision to invoke this article rests on the nonperforming party once the aggrieved party receives effective notice of cure it must permit cure and as provided in article 513 cooperate with the non performing party for example the aggrieved party must permit any inspection that is reasonably necessary for the nonperforming party to effect cure if the aggrieved party refuses to permit cure when required to do so any notice of termination is ineffective moreover the aggrieved party may not seek remedies for any nonperformance that could have been cured i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 a agrees to construct a shed on bs property in order to protect bs machinery from the weather the roof is constructed in a defective manner during a storm water leaks into the shed and bs machinery is damaged b gives notice of termination a gives timely notice of cure b does not wish to deal further with a and refuses the cure if cure is appropriate in the circumstances and the other conditions for cure are met b cannot invoke remedies for the faulty construction but can recover for damage caused to the machinery before the cure was to be effected if cure is inappropriate in the circumstances or if the proposed cure would not have solved the problem the contract is terminated by bs notice article 715 additional period for performance 1 in a case of nonperformance the aggrieved party may by notice to the other party allow an additional period of time for performance 2 during the additional period the aggrieved party may withhold performance of its own reciprocal obligations and may claim damages but may not resort to any other remedy if it receives notice from the other party nonperformance in general art 715 235 that the latter will not perform within that period or if upon expiry of that period due performance has not been made the aggrieved party may resort to any of the remedies that may be available under this chapter 3 where in a case of delay in perform ance which is not fundamental the aggrieved party has given notice allowing an additional period of time of reasonable length it may terminate the contract at the end of that period if the additional period allowed is not of reasonable length it shall be extended to a reasonable length the aggrieved party may in its notice provide that if the other party fails to perform within the period allowed by the notice the contract shall automatically terminate 4 paragraph 3 does not apply where the obligation which has not been performed is only a minor part of the contractual obligation of the nonperforming party comment this article deals with the situation where one party performs late and the other party is willing to give extra time for performance it is inspired by the german concept of nachfrist although similar results are obtained by different conceptual means in other legal systems 1 special characteristics of late performance the article recognises that late performance is significantly different from other forms of defective performance late performance can never be remedied since once the date for performance has passed it will not occur again but nevertheless in many cases the party who is entitled to performance will much prefer even a late performance to no performance at all secondly at the moment when a party fails to perform on time it is often unclear how late performance will in fact be the commercial interest of the party receiving performance may often therefore be that a reasonably speedy completion although late will be perfectly acceptable but that a long delayed completion will not the procedure enables that party to give the performing party a second chance without prejudicing its other remedies art 715 unidroit principles 236 2 effects of granting extension of time for performance the party who grants the extension of time cannot terminate or seek specific performance during the extension time the right to recover damages arising from late performance is not affected the position at the end of the period of extension depends on whether the late performance was already fundamental at the time when the extension was granted in this situation if the contract is not completely performed during the extension the right to terminate for fundamental nonperformance simply springs into life again as soon as the extension period expires on the other hand if the late performance was not yet fundamental termination would only be possible at the end of the period of extension if the extension was reasonable in length i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a agrees to construct a special bulletproof body for bs mercedes the contract provides that the body is to be finished by 1 february so that the car can be shipped to bs country of residence on 31 january the car is needed but not yet quite finished a assures b that it will be able to complete the work if given another week and b agrees to a weeks extension of time if the car is finished within the week b must accept it but may recover any damages for example extra shipping charges if the work is not finished within the week b may refuse to accept delivery and terminate the contract 2 a a company in country x concludes a contract with b a company in country y to build 100 km of motorway in the latter country the contract provides that the motorway will be finished within two years from the start of the work after two years a has in fact built 85 km and it is clear that it will take at least three more months to finish the motorway b gives a notice to complete within a further month b is not entitled to terminate at the end of the month because the additional period of time is not reasonable it shall be extended to the reasonable period of three months nonperformance in general art 716 237 article 716 exemption clauses a clause which limits or excludes one partys liability for nonperformance or which permits one party to render performance sub stantially different from what the other party reasonably expected may not be invoked if it would be grossly unfair to do so having regard to the purpose of the contract comment 1 the need for a special rule on exemption clauses the principles contain no general rule permitting a court to strike down abusive or unconscionable contract terms apart from the principle of good faith and fair dealing see article 17 which may exceptionally be invoked in this respect there is only one provision permitting the avoidance at any time of the contract as a whole as well as of any of its individual terms when they unjustifiably give one party an excessive advantage see article 327 the reason for the inclusion of a specific provision on exemption clauses is that they are particularly common in international contract practice and tend to give rise to much controversy between the parties ultimately this article has opted in favour of a rule which gives the court a broad discretionary power based on the principle of fairness terms regulating the consequences of nonperformance are in principle valid but the court may ignore clauses which are grossly unfair 2 exemption clauses defined for the purpose of this article exemption clauses are in the first instance those terms which directly limit or exclude the nonperforming partys liability in the event of nonperformance such clauses may be expressed in different ways eg fixed sum ceiling percentage of the performance in question deposit retained exemption clauses are further considered to be those which permit a party to render a performance substantially different from what the other party reasonably expected in practice clauses of this kind are in particular those the purpose or effect of which is to allow the performing party unilaterally to alter the character of the performance art 716 unidroit principles 238 promised in such a way as to transform the contract such clauses are to be distinguished from those which are limited to defining the performance undertaken by the party in question i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a tour operator offers at a high price a tour providing for accommodation in specifically designated luxury hotels a term of the contract provides that the operator may alter the accommodation if the circumstances so require if the operator puts up its clients in second class hotels it will be liable to them notwithstanding the contractual term since the clients expected to be accommodated in hotels of a category similar to that which had been promised 2 a hotelkeeper exhibits a notice to the effect that the hotel is responsible for cars left in the garage but not for objects contained in the cars this term is not an exemption clause for the purpose of this article since its purpose is merely that of defining the scope of the hotelkeepers obligation 3 exemption clauses to be distinguished from forfeiture clauses exemption clauses are to be distinguished from forfeiture clauses which permit a party to withdraw from a contract on payment of an indemnity in practice however there may be forfeiture clauses which are in reality intended by the parties to operate as disguised exemption clauses 4 exemption clauses and agreed payment for nonperformance a contract term providing that a party who does not perform is to pay a specified sum to the aggrieved party for such nonperformance see article 7413 may also have the effect of limiting the compensation due to the aggrieved party in such cases the non performing party may not be entitled to rely on the term in question if the conditions laid down in this article are satisfied i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 a enters into a contract with b for the building of a factory the contract contains a penalty clause providing for payment of australian dollars aud 10000 for each week of delay the work is not completed within the agreed period because a deliberately suspends the work for another project which was more lucrative for it and in respect of which the penalty for delay was higher the actual harm suffered by b as a result of the delay amounts to aud 20000 per week a is not entitled to rely on the penalty clause and b may recover full compensation of the actual harm sustained as the nonperformance in general art 716 239 enforcement of that clause would in the circumstances be grossly unfair in view of as deliberate nonperformance 5 cases where exemption clauses may not be relied upon following the approach adopted in most national legal systems this article starts out from the assumption that in application of the doctrine of freedom of contract see article 11 exemption clauses are in principle valid a party may not however invoke such a clause if it would be grossly unfair to do so this will above all be the case where the term is inherently unfair and its application would lead to an evident imbalance between the performances of the parties moreover there may be circumstances in which even a term that is not in itself manifestly unfair may not be relied upon for instance where the nonperformance is the result of grossly negligent conduct or where the aggrieved party could not have obviated the consequences of the limitation or exclusion of liability by taking out appropriate insurance in all cases regard must be had to the purpose of the contract and in particular to what a party could legitimately have expected from the performance of the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 a an accountant undertakes to prepare bs accounts the contract contains a term excluding any liability of a for the consequences arising from any inaccuracy whatsoever in as performance of the contract as a result of a serious mistake by a b pays 100 more taxes than were due a may not rely on the exemption clause which is inherently unfair 5 a a warehouse operator enters into a contract with b for the surveillance of its premises the contract contains a term limiting bs liability thefts occur in the terminal resulting in loss exceeding the amount of the limitation although the term agreed upon by two professional parties is not inherently unfair it may not be relied upon by b if the thefts were committed by bs servants in the course of their employment 6 consequence of inability to rely on exemption clauses if a party is not entitled to rely on an exemption clause its liability is unaffected and the aggrieved party may obtain full compensation for the nonperformance contrary to the rule laid down with respect to agreed payment for nonperformance in article 7413 the court has no power to modify the exemption clause art 717 unidroit principles 240 article 717 force majeure 1 nonperformance by a party is excused if that party proves that the nonperformance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences 2 when the impediment is only tempo rary the excuse shall have effect for such period as is reasonable having regard to the effect of the impediment on the performance of the contract 3 the party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on its ability to perform if the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment it is liable for damages resulting from such nonreceipt 4 nothing in this article prevents a party from exercising a right to terminate the contract or to withhold performance or request interest on money due comment 1 the notion of force majeure this article covers the ground covered in common law systems by the doctrines of frustration and impossibility of performance and in civil law systems by doctrines such as force majeure unmglichkeit etc but it is identical with none of these doctrines the term force majeure was chosen because it is widely known in international trade practice as confirmed by the inclusion in many international contracts of socalled force majeure clauses nonperformance in general art 717 241 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a manufacturer in country x sells a nuclear power station to b a utility company in country y under the terms of the contract a undertakes to supply all the power stations requirements of uranium for ten years at a price fixed for that period expressed in us dollars and payable in new york the following separate events occur i after five years the currency of country y collapses to 1 of its value against the dollar at the time of the contract b is not discharged from liability as the parties have allocated this risk by the payment provisions ii after five years the government of country y imposes foreign exchange controls which prevent b paying in any currency other than that of country y b is excused from paying in us dollars a is entitled to terminate the contract to supply uranium iii after five years the world uranium market is cornered by a group of speculators the price of uranium on the world market rises to ten times the contract figure a is not excused from delivering uranium as this is a risk which was foreseeable at the time of making the contract 2 effects of force majeure on the rights and duties of the parties the article does not restrict the rights of the party who has not received performance to terminate if the nonperformance is fundamental what it does do where it applies is to excuse the non performing party from liability in damages in some cases the impediment will prevent any performance at all but in many others it will simply delay performance and the effect of the article will be to give extra time for performance it should be noted that in this event the extra time may be greater or less than the length of the interruption because the crucial question will be what is the effect of the interruption on the progress of the contract i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a contracts to lay a natural gas pipeline across country x climatic conditions are such that it is normally impossible to work between 1 november and 31 march the contract is timed to finish on 31 october but the start of work is delayed for a month by a civil war in a neighbouring country which makes it impossible to bring in all the piping on time if the consequence is reasonably to prevent the completion of the work until its resumption in the following spring a may be entitled to an extension of five months even though the delay was itself of one month only art 717 unidroit principles 242 3 force majeure and hardship this article must be read together with chapter 6 section 2 of the principles dealing with hardship see comment 6 on article 622 4 force majeure and contract practice the definition of force majeure in paragraph 1 of this article is necessarily of a rather general character international commercial contracts often contain much more precise and elaborate provisions in this regard the parties may therefore find it appropriate to adapt the content of this article so as to take account of the particular features of the specific transaction 5 longterm contracts force majeure like hardship is typically relevant in longterm contracts see comment 5 on article 622 and the same facts may present both hardship and force majeure see comment 6 on article 622 in the case of hardship the principles encourage negotiation between the parties to the end of continuing the relationship rather than dissolving it see article 623 similarly in the case of force majeure parties to longterm contracts can anticipate that in light of the duration and nature of the relationship and possibly large initial investments whose value would be realised only over time they would have an interest in continuing rather than terminating their business relationship accordingly the parties may wish to provide in their contract for the continuation whenever feasible of the business relationship even in the case of force majeure and envisage termination only as a last resort such provisions can take a number of forms i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 a longterm contract contains a provision to the effect that except where it is clear from the outset that an impediment to a partys performance is of a permanent nature the obligations of the party affected by the impediment are temporarily suspended for the length of the impediment but for no more than 30 days and any right of either party to terminate the contract is similarly suspended the provision also states that at the end of that time period if the impediment continues the parties will negotiate with a view to agreeing to prolong the suspension on terms that are mutually agreed it also states that if such agreement cannot be reached disputed matters will be referred to a dispute board pursuant to the icc dispute board rules the parties are bound by that procedure 243 section 2 right to performance article 721 performance of monetary obligation where a party who is obliged to pay money does not do so the other party may require payment comment this article reflects the generally accepted principle that payment of money which is due under a contractual obligation can always be demanded and if the demand is not met enforced by legal action before a court the term require is used in this article to cover both the demand addressed to the other party and the enforcement whenever necessary of such a demand by a court the article applies irrespective of the currency in which payment is due or may be made in other words the right of the obligee to require payment extends also to cases of payment in a foreign currency for the determination of the currency in which a monetary obligation is due or payment may be made see articles 619 6110 and 7412 exceptionally the right to require payment of the price of the goods or services to be delivered or rendered may be excluded this is in particular the case where a usage requires a seller to resell goods which are neither accepted nor paid for by the buyer for the applicability of usages see article 19 article 722 performance of nonmonetary obligation where a party who owes an obligation other than one to pay money does not perform the other party may require performance unless a performance is impossible in law or in fact b performance or where relevant enforcement is unreasonably burdensome or expensive art 722 unidroit principles 244 c the party entitled to performance may reasonably obtain performance from another source d performance is of an exclusively personal character or e the party entitled to performance does not require performance within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become aware of the nonperformance comment 1 right to require performance of nonmonetary obligations in accordance with the general principle of the binding character of the contract see article 13 each party should as a rule be entitled to require performance by the other party not only of monetary but also of nonmonetary obligations assumed by that party while this is not controversial in civil law countries common law systems allow enfor cement of nonmonetary obligations only in special circumstances following the basic approach of cisg article 46 this article adopts the principle of specific performance subject to certain qualifications the principle is particularly important with respect to contracts other than sales contracts unlike the obligation to deliver something contractual obligations to do something or to abstain from doing something can often be performed only by the other contracting party itself in such cases the only way of obtaining performance from a party who is unwilling to perform is by enforcement 2 remedy not discretionary while cisg provides that a court is not bound to enter a judgement for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law in respect of similar contracts of sale not governed by the convention article 28 under the principles specific performance is not a discretionary remedy ie a court must order performance unless one of the exceptions laid down in this article applies 3 exceptions to the right to require performance a impossibility a performance which is impossible in law or in fact cannot be required subparagraph a however impossibility does not nullify a right to performance art 722 245 contract other remedies may be available to the aggrieved party see articles 313 and 7174 the refusal of a public permission which is required under the applicable domestic law and which affects the validity of the contract renders the contract void see article 61171 with the consequence that the problem of enforceability of the performance cannot arise when however the refusal merely renders the performance impossible without affecting the validity of the contract see article 61172 sub paragraph a of this article applies and performance cannot be required b unreasonable burden in exceptional cases particularly when there has been a drastic change of circumstances after the conclusion of a contract performance although still possible may have become so onerous that it would run counter to the general principle of good faith and fair dealing see article 17 to require it i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 an oil tanker has sunk in coastal waters in a heavy storm although it would be possible to lift the ship from the bottom of the sea the shipper may not require performance of the contract of carriage if this would involve the shipowner in expense vastly exceeding the value of the oil see article 722b the words where relevant enforcement take account of the fact that in common law systems it is the courts and not the obligees who supervise the execution of orders for specific performance as a consequence in certain cases especially those involving performances extended in time courts in those countries refuse specific performance if supervision would impose undue burdens upon courts as to other possible consequences arising from drastic changes of circumstances amounting to a case of hardship see articles 621 et seq c replacement transaction many goods and services are of a standard kind ie the same goods or services are offered by many suppliers if a contract for such staple goods or standard services is not performed most customers will not wish to waste time and effort extracting the contractual performance from the other party instead they will go into the market obtain substitute goods or services and claim damages for nonperformance in view of this economic reality subparagraph c excludes specific performance whenever the party entitled to performance may reasonably art 722 unidroit principles 246 obtain performance from another source that party may terminate the contract and conclude a replacement transaction see article 745 the word reasonably indicates that the mere fact that the same performance can be obtained from another source is not in itself suffi cient since the aggrieved party could not in certain circumstances reasonably be expected to have recourse to an alternative supplier i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a situated in a developing country where foreign exchange is scarce buys a machine of a standard type from b a manufacturer situated in country x a developed country in compliance with the contract a pays the price of usd 100000 before delivery b does not deliver although a could obtain the machine from another source in country x it would be unreasonable in view of the scarcity and high price of foreign exchange in its home country to require a to take this course a is therefore entitled to require delivery of the machine from b d performance of an exclusively personal character where performance has an exclusively personal character enforce ment would interfere with the personal freedom of the obligor moreover enforcement of performance often impairs its quality the supervision of a very personal performance may also give rise to insuperable practical difficulties as is shown by the experience of countries which have saddled their courts with this kind of respons ibility for all these reasons subparagraph d excludes enforcement of performance of an exclusively personal character the precise scope of this exception depends essentially upon the meaning of the phrase exclusively personal character the modern tendency is to confine this concept to performances of a unique character the exception does not apply to obligations undertaken by a company nor are ordinary activities of a lawyer a surgeon or an engineer covered by the phrase for they can be performed by other persons with the same training and experience a performance is of an exclusively personal character if it is not delegable and requires individual skills of an artistic or scientific nature or if it involves a confidential and personal relationship right to performance art 723 247 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 an undertaking by a firm of architects to design a row of ten buildings can be specifically enforced as the firm can delegate the task to one of the partners or employ an outside architect to perform it 4 by contrast an undertaking by a worldfamous architect to design a new city hall embodying the idea of a city of the 21st century cannot be enforced because it is highly unique and calls for the exercise of very special skills the performance of obligations to abstain from doing something does not fall under subparagraph d e request within reasonable time performance of a contract often requires special preparation and efforts by the obligor if the time for performance has passed but the obligee has failed to demand performance within a reasonable time the obligor may be entitled to assume that the obligee will not insist upon performance if the obligee were to be allowed to leave the obligor in a state of uncertainty as to whether performance will be required the risk might arise of the obligees speculating unfairly to the detriment of the obligor upon a favourable development of the market for these reasons subparagraph e excludes the right to perform ance if it is not required within a reasonable time after the obligee has become or ought to have become aware of the nonperformance for a similar rule concerning the loss of the right to terminate the contract see article 7322 article 723 repair and replacement of defective performance the right to performance includes in appropriate cases the right to require repair replacement or other cure of defective perform ance the provisions of articles 721 and 722 apply accordingly art 723 unidroit principles 248 comment 1 right to performance in case of defective performance this article applies the general principles of articles 721 and 722 to a special yet very frequent case of nonperformance ie defective performance for the sake of clarity the article specifies that the right to require performance includes the right of the party who has received a defective performance to require cure of the defect 2 cure of defective performance under the principles cure denotes the right both of the non performing party to correct its performance see article 714 and of the aggrieved party to require such correction by the nonperforming party this article deals with the latter right the article expressly mentions two specific examples of cure namely repair and replacement repairing defective goods or making good an insufficient service is the most common case and replacement of a defective performance is also frequent the right to require repair or replacement may also exist with respect to the payment of money for instance in case of an insufficient payment or of a payment in the wrong currency or to an account different from that agreed upon by the parties apart from repair and replacement there are other forms of cure such as the removal of the rights of third persons over goods or the obtaining of a necessary public permission 3 restrictions the right to require cure of a defective performance is subject to the same limitations as the right to performance in general most of the exceptions to the right to require performance that are set out in article 722 are easily applicable to the various forms of cure of a defective performance only the application of subparagraph b calls for specific comment in many cases involving small insignificant defects both replacement and repair may involve unreasonable effort or expense and are therefore excluded i l l u s t r a t i o n a new car is sold which has a small painting defect which decreases the value of the car by 001 of the purchase price repainting would cost 05 of the purchase price a claim for repair is excluded but the buyer is entitled to require a reduction in the purchase price right to performance art 724 249 article 724 judicial penalty 1 where the court orders a party to perform it may also direct that this party pay a penalty if it does not comply with the order 2 the penalty shall be paid to the aggrieved party unless mandatory provisions of the law of the forum provide otherwise payment of the penalty to the aggrieved party does not exclude any claim for damages comment 1 judicially imposed penalty experience in some legal systems has shown that the threat of a judicially imposed penalty for disobedience is a most effective means of ensuring compliance with judgments ordering the performance of contractual obligations other systems on the contrary do not provide for such sanctions because they are considered to constitute an inadmissible encroachment upon personal freedom this article takes a middle course by providing for monetary but not for other forms of penalty applicable to all kinds of orders for performance including those for payment of money 2 imposition of penalty at discretion of the court the use of the word may in paragraph 1 of this article makes it clear that the imposition of a penalty is a matter of discretion for the court its exercise depends upon the kind of obligation to be performed in the case of money judgments a penalty should be imposed only in exceptional situations especially where speedy payment is essential for the aggrieved party the same is true for obligations to deliver goods obligations to pay money or to deliver goods can normally be easily enforced by ordinary means of execution by contrast in the case of obligations to do or to abstain from doing something which moreover cannot easily be performed by a third person enforcement by means of judicial penalties is often the most appropriate solution 3 beneficiary legal systems differ as to the question of whether judicial penalties should be paid to the aggrieved party to the state or to both some art 724 unidroit principles 250 systems regard payment to the aggrieved party as constituting an unjustified windfall benefit which is contrary to public policy while rejecting this latter view and indicating the aggrieved party as the beneficiary of the penalty the first sentence of paragraph 2 of this article expressly mentions the possibility of mandatory provisions of the law of the forum not permitting such a solution and indicating other possible beneficiaries of judicial penalties 4 judicial penalties distinguished from damages and from agreed payment for nonperformance the second sentence of paragraph 2 makes it clear that a judicial penalty paid to the aggrieved party does not affect its claim for damages payment of the penalty is regarded as compensating the aggrieved party for those disadvantages which cannot be taken into account under the ordinary rules for the recovery of damages moreover since payment of damages will usually occur substantially later than payment of a judicial penalty courts may to some degree be able in measuring the damages to take the payment of the penalty into account judicial penalties are moreover to be distinguished from agreed payments for nonperformance which are dealt with in article 7413 although the latter fulfil a function similar to that of the former if the court considers that the contractual stipulation of the payment of a sum in case of nonperformance already provides a sufficient incentive for performance it may refuse to impose a judicial penalty 5 form and procedure a judicial penalty may be imposed in the form of a lump sum payment or of a payment by instalments the procedure relating to the imposition of a judicial penalty is governed by the lex fori 6 penalties imposed by arbitrators since according to article 111 court includes an arbitral tribunal the question arises of whether arbitrators might also be allowed to impose a penalty while a majority of legal systems seems to deny such a power to arbitrators some modern legislation and recent court practice have recognised it this solution which is in keeping with the increasingly important role of arbitration as an alternative means of dispute right to performance art 725 251 resolution especially in international commerce is endorsed by the principles since the execution of a penalty imposed by arbitrators can only be effected by or with the assistance of a court appropriate supervision is available to prevent any possible abuse of the arbitrators power 7 recognition and enforcement of decisions imposing penalties attention must be drawn to the problems of recognition and enforcement in countries other than the forum state of judicial decisions and of arbitral awards imposing penalties special rules on this matter are sometimes to be found in national law and to some extent in international treaties article 725 change of remedy 1 an aggrieved party who has required performance of a nonmonetary obligation and who has not received performance within a period fixed or otherwise within a reasonable period of time may invoke any other remedy 2 where the decision of a court for performance of a nonmonetary obligation cannot be enforced the aggrieved party may invoke any other remedy comment 1 aggrieved party entitled to change of remedy this article addresses a problem which is peculiar to the right to require performance the aggrieved party may abandon the remedy of requiring performance of a nonmonetary obligation and opt instead for another remedy or remedies this choice is permitted on account of the difficulties usually involved in the enforcement of nonmonetary obligations even if the aggrieved party first decides to invoke its right to require performance it would not be fair to confine that party to this single option the non performing party may subsequently become unable to perform or its inability may only become evident during the proceedings art 725 unidroit principles 252 2 voluntary change of remedy two situations must be addressed in the first case the aggrieved party has required performance but changes its mind before execution of a judgment in its favour perhaps because it has discovered the nonperforming partys inability to perform the aggrieved party now wishes to invoke one or more other remedies such a voluntary change of remedy can only be admitted if the interests of the nonperforming party are duly protected it may have prepared for performance invested effort and incurred expense for this reason paragraph 1 of this article makes it clear that the aggrieved party is entitled to invoke another remedy only if it has not received performance within a fixed period or otherwise within a reasonable period of time how much additional time must be made available to the non performing party for performance depends upon the difficulty which the performance involves the nonperforming party has the right to perform provided it does so before the expiry of the additional period for similar conditions which restrict the right of termination in case of delay in performance see article 7322 3 unenforceable decision paragraph 2 addresses the second and less difficult case in which the aggrieved party has attempted without success to enforce a judicial decision or arbitral award directing the nonperforming party to perform in this situation it is obvious that the aggrieved party may immediately pursue other remedies 4 time limits in the event of a subsequent change of remedy the time limit provided for a notice of termination under article 7322 must of course be extended accordingly the reasonable time for giving notice begins to run in the case of a voluntary change of remedy after the aggrieved party has or ought to have become aware of the non performance at the expiry of the additional period of time available to the nonperforming party to perform and in the case of paragraph 2 of this article it will begin to run after the aggrieved party has or ought to have become aware of the unenforceability of the decision or award requiring performance 253 section 3 termination article 731 right to terminate the contract 1 a party may terminate the contract where the failure of the other party to perform an obligation under the contract amounts to a fundamental nonperformance 2 in determining whether a failure to perform an obligation amounts to a fundamental nonperformance regard shall be had in particular to whether a the nonperformance substantially deprives the aggrieved party of what it was entitled to expect under the contract unless the other party did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen such result b strict compliance with the obligation which has not been performed is of essence under the contract c the nonperformance is intentional or reckless d the nonperformance gives the aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot rely on the other partys future performance e the nonperforming party will suffer disproportionate loss as a result of the preparation or performance if the contract is terminated 3 in the case of delay the aggrieved party may also terminate the contract if the other party fails to perform before the time allowed it under article 715 has expired comment 1 termination even if nonperformance is excused the rules set out in this section are intended to apply both to cases where the nonperforming party is liable for the nonperformance and to those where the nonperformance is excused so that the aggrieved party art 731 unidroit principles 254 can claim neither specific performance nor damages for non performance i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a company located in country x buys wine from b in country y the government of country x subsequently imposes an embargo upon the import of agricultural products from country y although the impediment cannot be attributed to a b may terminate the contract 2 right to terminate the contract dependent on fundamental non performance whether in a case of nonperformance by one party the other party should have the right to terminate the contract depends upon the weighing of a number of considerations on the one hand performance may be so late or so defective that the aggrieved party cannot use it for its intended purpose or the behaviour of the nonperforming party may in other respects be such that the aggrieved party should be permitted to terminate the contract on the other hand termination will often cause serious detriment to the nonperforming party whose expenses in preparing and tendering performance may not be recovered for these reasons paragraph 1 of this article provides that an aggrieved party may terminate the contract only if the nonperformance of the other party is fundamental ie material and not merely of minor importance see also articles 733 and 734 3 circumstances of significance in determining whether non performance is fundamental paragraph 2 of this article lists a number of circumstances which are relevant to the determination of whether in a given case failure to perform an obligation amounts to fundamental nonperformance a nonperformance substantially depriving the other party of its expectations the first factor referred to in paragraph 2a is that the non performance is so fundamental that the aggrieved party is substantially deprived of what it was entitled to expect at the time of the conclusion of the contract termination art 731 255 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 on 1 may a contracts to deliver standard software before 15 may to b who has requested speedy delivery if a tenders delivery on 15 june b may refuse delivery and terminate the contract the aggrieved party cannot terminate the contract if the non performing party can show that it did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen that the nonperformance was fundamental for the other party i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 a undertakes to remove waste from bs site within thirty days without specifying the exact date of commencement b fails to inform a that b has hired excavators at high cost to begin work on the site on 2 january b cannot terminate its contract with a on the ground that a had not cleared the site on 2 january b strict performance of contract of essence paragraph 2b looks not at the actual gravity of the non performance but at the nature of the contractual obligation for which strict performance might be of essence such obligations of strict performance are not uncommon in commercial contracts for example in contracts for the sale of commodities the time of delivery is normally considered to be of the essence and in a documentary credit transaction the documents tendered must conform strictly to the terms of the credit c intentional nonperformance paragraph 2c deals with the situation where the nonperformance is intentional or reckless it may however be contrary to good faith see article 17 to terminate a contract if the nonperformance even though committed intentionally is insignificant d no reliance on future performance under paragraph 2d the fact that nonperformance gives the aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot rely on the other partys future performance is of significance if a party is to make its performance in instalments and it is clear that a defect found in one of the earlier performances will be repeated in all performances the aggrieved party may terminate the contract even if the defects in the early instalment would not of themselves justify termination sometimes an intentional breach may show that a party cannot be trusted art 732 unidroit principles 256 i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a the agent of b who is entitled to reimbursement for expenses submits false vouchers to b although the amounts claimed are insignificant b may treat as behaviour as a funda mental nonperformance and terminate the agency contract e disproportionate loss paragraph 2e deals with situations in which a party who fails to perform has relied on the contract and has prepared or tendered performance in these cases regard is to be had to the extent to which that party suffers disproportionate loss if the nonperformance is treated as fundamental nonperformance is less likely to be treated as fundamental if it occurs late after the preparation of performance than if it occurs early before such preparation whether a performance tendered or rendered can be of any benefit to the nonperforming party if it is refused or has to be returned to that party is also of relevance i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 on 1 may a undertakes to deliver software which is to be produced specifically for b it is agreed that delivery shall be made before 31 december a tenders delivery on 31 january at which time b still needs the software which a cannot sell to other users b may claim damages from a but cannot terminate the contract 4 termination after nachfrist paragraph 3 makes reference to article 715 paragraph 3 of which provides that the aggrieved party may use the nachfrist procedure to terminate a contract which may not otherwise be terminated in case of delay see comment 2 on article 715 article 732 notice of termination 1 the right of a party to terminate the contract is exercised by notice to the other party termination art 732 257 2 if performance has been offered late or otherwise does not conform to the contract the aggrieved party will lose its right to terminate the contract unless it gives notice to the other party within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become aware of the offer or of the non conforming performance comment 1 the requirement of notice paragraph 1 of this article reaffirms the principle that the right of a party to terminate the contract is exercised by notice to the other party the notice requirement will permit the nonperforming party to avoid any loss due to uncertainty as to whether the aggrieved party will accept the performance at the same time it prevents the aggrieved party from speculating on a rise or fall in the value of the performance to the detriment of the nonperforming party 2 performance overdue when performance is due but has not been made the aggrieved partys course of action will depend upon its wishes and knowledge it may be the case that the aggrieved party does not know whether the other party intends to perform and either no longer wants the performance or is undecided in this case the aggrieved party may wait and see whether performance is ultimately tendered and make up its mind if and when this happens paragraph 2 alternatively it may still want the other party to perform in which case it must seek performance within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become aware of the nonperformance see article 722e this article does not deal with the situation where the non performing party asks the aggrieved party whether it will accept late performance nor does it deal with the situation where the aggrieved party learns from another source that the nonperforming party intends nevertheless to perform the contract in such cases good faith and fair dealing see article 17 may require that the aggrieved party inform the other party if it does not wish to accept the late performance if it does not do so it may be held liable in damages art 733 unidroit principles 258 3 reasonable time an aggrieved party who intends to terminate the contract must give notice to the other party within a reasonable time after it becomes or ought to have become aware of the nonperformance paragraph 2 what is reasonable depends upon the circumstances in situations where the aggrieved party may easily obtain a substitute performance and may thus speculate on a rise or fall in the price notice must be given without delay when it must make enquiries as to whether it can obtain substitute performance from other sources the reasonable period of time will be longer 4 notice must be received the notice to be given by the aggrieved party becomes effective when the nonperforming party receives it see article 110 article 733 anticipatory nonperformance where prior to the date for performance by one of the parties it is clear that there will be a fundamental nonperformance by that party the other party may terminate the contract comment this article establishes the principle that a nonperformance which is to be expected is to be equated with a nonperformance which occurred at the time when performance fell due it is a requirement that it be clear that there will be nonperformance a suspicion even a well founded one is not sufficient furthermore it is necessary that the non performance be fundamental and that the party who is to receive performance give notice of termination an example of anticipatory nonperformance is the case where one party declares that it will not perform the contract however the circumstances also may indicate that there will be a fundamental non performance termination art 734 259 i l l u s t r a t i o n a promises to deliver oil to b by ms paul at the terminal in country x on 3 february on 25 january ms paul is still 2000 kilometres from the terminal at the speed it is making it will not arrive on 3 february but at the earliest on 8 february as time is of the essence a substantial delay is to be expected and b may terminate the contract before 3 february article 734 adequate assurance of due performance a party who reasonably believes that there will be a fundamental nonperformance by the other party may demand adequate assurance of due performance and may meanwhile withhold its own performance where this assurance is not provided within a reasonable time the party demanding it may terminate the contract comment 1 reasonable expectation of fundamental nonperformance this article protects the interest of a party who has reason to believe that the other will be unable or unwilling to perform the contract at the due date but who cannot invoke article 733 since there is still a possibility that the other party will or can perform in the absence of the rule laid down in this article the former party would often be in a dilemma if it were to wait until the due date of performance and this did not take place it might incur loss if on the other hand it were to terminate the contract and it then became apparent that the contract would have been performed by the other party its action will amount to nonperformance of the contract and it will be liable in damages 2 right to withhold performance pending adequate assurance of performance consequently this article enables a party who reasonably believes that there will be a fundamental nonperformance by the other party to demand an assurance of performance from the other party and in the art 735 unidroit principles 260 meantime to withhold its own performance what constitutes an adequate assurance will depend upon the circumstances in some cases the other partys declaration that it will perform will suffice while in others a request for security or for a guarantee from a third person may be justified i l l u s t r a t i o n a a boatbuilder with only one berth promises to build a yacht for b to be delivered on 1 may and no later soon afterwards b learns from c that a has promised to build a yacht for c during the same period b is entitled to ask a for an adequate assurance that the yacht will be delivered on time and a will then have to give b a satisfactory explanation of how it intends to perform its contract with b 3 termination of the contract if adequate assurance of due performance is not given the other party may terminate the contract article 735 effects of termination in general 1 termination of the contract releases both parties from their obligation to effect and to receive future performance 2 termination does not preclude a claim for damages for nonperformance 3 termination does not affect any provision in the contract for the settlement of dis putes or any other term of the contract which is to operate even after termination comment 1 termination extinguishes future obligations paragraph 1 of this article states the general rule that termination has effects for the future in that it releases both parties from their duty to effect and to receive future performance termination art 735 261 2 claim for damages not affected the fact that by virtue of termination the contract is brought to an end does not deprive the aggrieved party of its right to claim damages for nonperformance in accordance with the rules laid down in section 4 of this chapter i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a sells b specified production machinery after b has begun to operate the machinery serious defects in it lead to a shutdown of bs assembly plant b declares the contract terminated but may still claim damages see article 7352 3 contract provisions not affected by termination notwithstanding the general rule laid down in paragraph 1 there may be provisions or obligations which survive termination this is the case in particular with provisions or obligations relating to dispute settlement and governing law but there may be other provisions or obligations which by their very nature are intended to continue to operate even after termination or to operate only upon termination they may relate to provisions on confidentiality noncompetition payment of interest or unwinding of the contractual relationship eg return of inventory documents or advertising materials return of media or documents containing confidential information indemnities treatment of intellectual property rights or databases exit costs etc i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that a discloses to b confidential information which is necessary for the production and which b agrees not to disclose for as long as it does not become public knowledge the contract further contains a clause referring disputes to the courts of as country even after termination of the contract by b b remains under a duty not to disclose the confidential information and any dispute relating to the contract and its effects is to be settled by the courts of as country see article 7353 3 a an equipment leasing company established in country x leases a commercial aircraft to b an airline operating regional flights in country z the aircraft is registered for nationality purposes in country z in the name of b as operator as international aviation regulation prevents the redeployment of the aircraft without it being deregistered from z b has contractually agreed to procure that de registration upon termination b decides to standardise its fleet and art 735 unidroit principles 262 terminates the lease there is no power of attorney previously issued to a to arrange for the deregistration and export of the aircraft b has a duty to cooperate with a in obtaining the deregistration and necessary administrative authorisations that will allow a to relocate the aircraft to another country 4 posttermination obligations in longterm contracts the issue of posttermination obligations is particularly relevant for longterm contracts in relation to surviving provisions the parties should consider addressing the following issues which provisions are to survive termination whether such provisions are binding on one or both parties after termination how long they survive who will bear the cost which remedies are available in case of nonperformance etc surviving provisions may be dealt with in various ways by a general clause stating that all provisions which by their nature are intended to operate even after termination will remain in force by listing the specific provisions intended to survive or by stating in the provision concerned that it is to remain in force notwithstanding termination contract drafters should pay close attention to the compatibility of the surviving duties with mandatory domestic law eg limitations on prohibitions to compete i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 the contract between a and b contains an indemnification clause by the latter in favour of the former for losses attributable to the delay in deregistration of the aircraft which is expressed to survive contractual termination that indemnification clause operates and is enforceable independent of any damage claim under the terminated contract though the payment thereof would impact the calculation of damages under such contract 5 consultant a undertakes to provide consultancy services for a new product to client b for an indefinite period intellectual property rights arising out of as services remain at all times with b with royalties being payable for a period of fifteen years from the date of first sale five years after the duty to pay royalties by b to a has arisen the contract is terminated pursuant to article 518 bs obligation to pay royalties will survive termination during the remaining period of ten years 6 client a and provider b are parties to an agreement under which a telecommunication system is to be provided by b to a according to the agreement b shall upon termination assist a in termination art 736 263 the migration of the services to an alternative provider and a is to pay the exit costs the agreement is terminated b is under a duty to assist a in migrating the system with a paying the exit costs article 736 restitution with respect to contracts to be performed at one time 1 on termination of a contract to be performed at one time either party may claim restitution of whatever it has supplied under the contract provided that such party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received under the contract 2 if restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable 3 the recipient of the performance does not have to make an allowance in money if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attributable to the other party 4 compensation may be claimed for expenses reasonably required to preserve or maintain the performance received comment 1 contracts to be performed at one time paragraph 1 of this article refers only to contracts to be performed at one time or under which at least the characteristic performance has to be made at one time while a different rule applies to longterm contracts see article 7371 the most common example of a contract to be performed at one time is an ordinary contract of sale where the entire object of the sale has to be transferred at one particular moment under a commercial contract one party will usually have to pay money for the performance received that obligation is not the one that is characteristic of the contract thus a contract of sale where the purchase price has to be paid in instalments will fall under this article provided that the sellers performance is to be made at one time art 736 unidroit principles 264 2 right of parties to restitution on termination paragraph 1 of this article gives each party a right to claim the return of whatever the party has supplied under the contract provided that that party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 in the process of a takeover of a company controlling shareholder a agrees to sell and transfer to b shares for gbp 1000000 b only pays gbp 600000 after the shares have been transferred and a therefore terminates the contract a can claim back the shares at the same time a has to return the gbp 600000 received from b this rule also applies when the aggrieved party has made a bad bargain if in the case mentioned in illustration 1 the real market value of the shares is gbp 1200000 a may still require the return of the shares this article also applies to the situation where the aggrieved party has supplied money in exchange for property services or other performances which the party has not received or which are defective i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 art dealer a sells a constable painting to art dealer b for eur 600000 b only pays eur 200000 for the painting and a therefore terminates the contract subsequently it turns out that the painting is not a constable but a copy on termination of the contract b can reclaim the purchase price and must return the painting to a as regards the costs involved in making restitution article 6111 applies 3 restitution in kind not possible or appropriate restitution must normally be made in kind there are however instances where instead of restitution in kind an allowance in money has to be made this is the case first of all where restitution in kind is not possible the allowance will normally amount to the value of the performance received i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 company a which has contracted to excavate company bs site leaves it after only part of the work has been done b which then terminates the contract will have to pay a a sum in compensation for the work done measured by the value that work termination art 736 265 has for b at the same time b will have a claim against a for whatever damages b may have suffered as a result of as breach of contract see article 7352 4 company a charters a ship for a company cruise for its employees which is to take them up the australian coral reef half way the cruise ship breaks down and cannot continue the cruise a terminates the contract with b the owner of the business organising the cruise and decides to fly its employees home if a had already paid the price a can now claim it back at the same time a owes b an allowance amounting to the value of the cruise so far in addition a can claim damages for the loss suffered as a result of bs non performance see article 7352 an allowance is further envisaged by paragraph 2 of this article whenever restitution in kind would not be appropriate this is so in particular when returning the performance in kind would cause unreasonable effort or expense the standard in that respect is the same as under article 722b i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a an artist sells 200 silverplated rings to dealer b b fails to pay for the rings and a thereupon terminates the contract it turns out that b has in the meantime attempted to ship the rings to his business premises however the boat on which they had been stored has sunk although it would be possible at great expense to rescue the rings from the wrecked ship this cannot be expected of b b has to pay a reasonable sum to a measured by the value of the rings the purpose of specifying that an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable is to make it clear that an allowance only has to be made if and to the extent that the performance has conferred a benefit on its recipient that is not the case for example where the defect which gives the recipient of the performance a right to terminate has only become apparent in the course of processing the object of that performance i l l u s t r a t i o n 6 company a hires company b to develop a specialised software to improve its existing internal communication system once b has developed and installed the software the software does not perform the functions it was intended to a can terminate the contract and re claim the price paid but since the installed system has no value for a it would not be reasonable to expect a to pay b an allowance for the installed software art 736 unidroit principles 266 4 the allocation of risk the rule contained in paragraph 2 implies an allocation of risk it imposes a liability on the recipient of the performance to make good the value of that performance if it is unable to make restitution in kind the rule in paragraph 2 applies even if the recipient was responsible for the deterioration or destruction of what it had received such allocation of the risk of deterioration or destruction is justified in particular because the risk should lie with the person in control of the performance on the contrary there is no liability to make good the value where the deterioration or destruction is attributable to the other party either because it was due to the other partys fault or because it was due to a defect inherent in the performance hence the rule in paragraph 3 i l l u s t r a t i o n 7 manufacturer a sells and delivers a luxury car to company b the car has defective brakes due to this defect it crashes into another car and is totally destroyed since the car was unfit to be used for its intended purpose b can terminate the contract and reclaim the purchase price b does not have to make an allowance for not being able to return the car the recipients liability to make good the value of the performance received is not excluded in cases where the deterioration or destruction would also have occurred had the performance not been rendered i l l u s t r a t i o n 8 manufacturer a sells and delivers a car to company b after delivery has taken place the car is totally destroyed by a hurricane flooding the properties of both a and b b terminates the contract because of a defect attaching to the car b can reclaim the purchase price but at the same time has to make an allowance for the value of the car prior to its destruction the question of the recipients liability to pay the value of the performance only arises in cases where the deterioration or destruction occurs before termination of the contract if what has been performed deteriorates or is destroyed after termination of the contract the normal rules on nonperformance apply as after termination the recipient of the performance is under a duty to return what the recipient has received any nonperformance of that duty gives the other party a right to claim damages according to article 741 unless the nonperformance is excused under article 717 termination art 736 267 i l l u s t r a t i o n 9 company a sells and delivers to company b a limousine with a leaking roof since the limousine is unfit to be used for its intended purpose b can terminate the contract as a result b can reclaim the purchase price but is under a duty to return the limousine before b can return the car it is totally destroyed by a thunderstorm a cannot claim damages because b is excused under article 717 5 compensation for expenses the recipient of a performance may have incurred expenses for the preservation or maintenance of the object of the performance it is reasonable to allow the recipient to claim compensation for these expenses where the contract has been terminated and where therefore the parties have to return what they have received i l l u s t r a t i o n 10 company a has sold and delivered a race horse to company b some time later it becomes apparent that the horse is not as a had promised a descendant of a particular stallion b terminates the contract b can claim compensation for the costs incurred in feeding and caring for the horse this rule applies only to reasonable expenses what is reasonable depends on the circumstances of the case in illustration 10 it would matter whether the horse had been sold as a race horse or as an ordinary farm horse compensation cannot be claimed for other expenses linked to the performance received even if they are reasonable i l l u s t r a t i o n 11 company a has sold and delivered a software package to company b b then discovers that the software is lacking a certain functionality it was supposed to have b therefore asks software expert c to check whether that functionality can still be imple mented since that turns out not to be possible b terminates the contract b cannot recover the fee paid to c as expenses under paragraph 4 from a 6 benefits the principles do not take a position concerning benefits that have been derived from the performance or interest that has been earned in commercial practice it will often be difficult to establish the value of the art 737 unidroit principles 268 benefits received by the parties as a result of the performance furthermore often both parties will have received such benefits 7 rights of third persons not affected in common with other articles of the principles this article deals with the relationship between the parties and not with any rights on the goods concerned that third persons may have acquired whether for instance an obligee of the buyer the buyers receivers in bankruptcy or a purchaser in good faith may oppose the restitution of goods sold is to be determined by the applicable law article 737 restitution with respect to longterm contracts 1 on termination of a longterm contract restitution can only be claimed for the period after termination has taken effect provided the contract is divisible 2 as far as restitution has to be made the provisions of article 736 apply comment 1 longterm contracts unlike the rule in paragraph 1 of article 736 with respect to contracts to be performed at one time paragraph 1 of this article provides that on termination of a longterm contract restitution can only be claimed for the period after termination has taken effect provided the contract is divisible indeed because under such contracts performance might have been made over a long period of time before the contract is terminated it may be inconvenient to unravel that performance furthermore termination is a remedy with prospective effect only see article 735 restitution can therefore only be claimed in respect of the period after termination i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a contracts to service bs computer hardware and software for a period of five years after three years of regular service a is obliged by illness to discontinue the services and the contract is terminated b who has paid a for the fourth year can claim termination art 737 269 restitution of the advance payment for that year but not for the money paid for the three years of regular service since contracts are terminated only for the future any outstanding payments for past performance can still be claimed this article does not prevent a claim for damages being brought i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 company a leases equipment to company b for three years at a rental of eur 10000 a month b pays punctually for the first two months but then fails to make any further payments despite repeated requests by a after a lapse of five months a terminates the lease a is entitled to retain the eur 20000 already received see article 7371 and to recover the eur 50000 accrued due on the basis of the contract of lease which is terminated only for the future together with whatever damages for breach it has sustained see article 7352 3 a a hospital engages b to carry out cleaning services for the hospital the contract to run for three years after a year b informs a that it cannot continue with the cleaning services unless the price is doubled a refuses to agree and b ceases to provide the service on terminating the contract a can recover damages for any additional expense it incurs in hiring another cleaning firm see article 741 in conjunction with article 7352 while b is entitled to retain the payments it has received for services already provided see article 7371 the rule that restitution can only be claimed for the period after termination has taken effect does not apply if the contract is indivisible i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a undertakes to paint ten pictures depicting one and the same historical event for bs festival hall after delivering and having been paid for five paintings a abandons the work in view of the fact that the decoration of the hall is supposed to consist of ten paintings to be painted by the same painter and showing different aspects of one historical event b can claim the return of the advances paid to a and must return the five paintings to a 2 restitution this article is a special rule which for longterm contracts excludes restitution for performance made in the past to the extent that there is restitution under this article it is governed by the provisions of article 736 270 section 4 damages article 741 right to damages any nonperformance gives the aggrieved party a right to damages either exclusively or in conjunction with any other remedies except where the nonperformance is excused under these principles comment 1 right to damages in general this article establishes the principle of a general right to damages in the event of nonperformance except where the nonperformance is excused under the principles as in the case of force majeure see article 717 or of an exemption clause see article 716 hardship see article 621 et seq does not in principle give rise to a right to damages the article recalls that the right to damages like other remedies arises from the sole fact of nonperformance it is enough for the aggrieved party simply to prove the nonperformance ie that it has not received what it was promised in particular it is not necessary in addition to prove that the nonperformance was due to the fault of the nonperforming party the degree of difficulty in proving the non performance will depend upon the content of the obligation and in particular on whether the obligation is one of best efforts or one to achieve a specific result see article 514 the right to damages exists in the event of failure to perform any of the obligations which arise from the contract thus it is not necessary to draw a distinction between principal and accessory obligations 2 damages may be combined with other remedies this article also states that the aggrieved party may request damages either as an exclusive remedy for example damages for delay in the case of late performance or for defective performance accepted by the aggrieved party damages in the event of impossibility of performance for which the nonperforming party is liable or in conjunction damages art 742 271 with other remedies thus in the case of termination of the contract damages may be requested to compensate the loss arising from such termination or again in the case of specific performance to compensate for the delay with which the aggrieved party receives performance and for any expenses which might have been incurred damages may also be accompanied by other remedies cure publication in newspapers of for example an admission of error etc 3 damages and precontractual liability the right to damages may arise not only in the context of non performance of the contract but also during the precontractual period see for instance article 2115 in case of negotiations in bad faith article 2116 in the event of breach of the duty of confidentiality or article 3216 in the case of mistake fraud threat or gross disparity the rules governing damages for nonperformance as laid down in this section may be applied by analogy to those situations article 742 full compensation 1 the aggrieved party is entitled to full compensation for harm sustained as a result of the nonperformance such harm includes both any loss which it suffered and any gain of which it was deprived taking into account any gain to the aggrieved party resulting from its avoidance of cost or harm 2 such harm may be nonpecuniary and includes for instance physical suffering or emotional distress comment 1 aggrieved party entitled to full compensation paragraph 1 of this article establishes the principle of the aggrieved partys entitlement to full compensation for the harm it has sustained as a result of the nonperformance of the contract it further affirms the need for a causal link between the nonperformance and the art 742 unidroit principles 272 harm see also comment 3 on article 743 nonperformance must be a source neither of gain nor of loss for the aggrieved party the solution to be found in some legal systems which allows the court to reduce the amount of damages having regard to the circumstances has not been followed since in international situations it could risk creating a considerable degree of uncertainty and its application might moreover vary from one court to another 2 damages cover loss suffered including loss of profit in specifying the harm for which damages are recoverable paragraph 1 of this article following the rule laid down in article 74 cisg states that the aggrieved party is entitled to compensation in respect not only of loss which it has suffered but also of any gain of which it has been deprived as a consequence of the nonperformance the notion of loss suffered must be understood in a wide sense it may cover a reduction in the aggrieved partys assets or an increase in its liabilities which occurs when an obligee not having been paid by its obligor must borrow money to meet its commitments the loss of profit or as it is sometimes called consequential loss is the benefit which would normally have accrued to the aggrieved party if the contract had been properly performed the benefit will often be uncertain so that it will frequently take the form of the loss of a chance see article 7432 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a national library sends a rare manuscript by special courier abroad for an exhibition the manuscript is irreparably damaged during transport its loss in value is estimated at eur 100000 and it is this sum which is due by the courier 2 a who has not been paid by b under the terms of their contract must borrow money from its bank at a high rate of interest b must compensate a for the interest due by the latter to its bank 3 a a construction company hires a crane from company b the boom of the crane which has been poorly maintained breaks and in falling crushes the architects car and results in an interruption of work on the site for eight days for which a must pay a penalty for delay of eur 50000 to the owner b must reimburse a for the expenses incurred as a consequence of the interruption of the work the amount of the penalty and the cost of repairing the architects car which a has had to pay 4 a a singer cancels an engagement with b an impresario a must pay damages to b in respect not only of the expenses incurred damages art 742 273 by b in preparing the concert but also of the loss of profit resulting from the cancellation of the concert 3 damages must not enrich the aggrieved party however the aggrieved party must not be enriched by damages for nonperformance it is for this reason that paragraph 1 also provides that account must be taken of any gain resulting to the aggrieved party from the nonperformance whether that be in the form of expenses which it has not incurred eg it does not have to pay the cost of a hotel room for an artist who fails to appear or of a loss which it has avoided eg in the event of nonperformance of what would have been a losing bargain for it i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a rents out excavating machinery to b for two years at a monthly rental of eur 10000 the contract is terminated after six months for nonpayment of the rentals six months later a succeeds in renting out the same machinery at a monthly charge of eur 11000 the gain of eur 12000 realised by a as a result of the re letting of the machinery for the remainder of the initial contract that is to say one year should be deducted from the damages due by b to a 4 damages in case of changes in the harm in application of the principle of full compensation regard is to be had to any changes in the harm including its expression in monetary terms which may occur between the time of the nonperformance and that of the judgment the rule however is not without exceptions for example if the aggrieved party has itself already made good the harm at its own expense the damages awarded will correspond to the amount of the sums disbursed 5 compensation of nonmaterial harm paragraph 2 of this article expressly provides for compensation also of nonpecuniary harm this may be pain and suffering loss of certain amenities of life aesthetic prejudice etc as well as harm resulting from attacks on honour or reputation art 743 unidroit principles 274 the rule might find application in international commerce in regard to contracts concluded by artists outstanding sportsmen or women and consultants engaged by a company or by an organisation in these cases also the requirement of the certainty of harm must be satisfied see article 743 together with the other conditions for entitlement to damages i l l u s t r a t i o n 6 a a young architect who is beginning to build up a certain reputation signs a contract for the modernisation of a municipal fine arts museum the appointment receives wide press coverage the municipal authorities subsequently decide to engage the services of a more experienced architect and terminate the contract with a a may obtain compensation not only for the material loss suffered but also for the harm to as reputation and the loss of the chance of becoming better known which the commission would have provided the compensation of nonmaterial harm may assume different forms and it is for the court to decide which of them whether taken alone or together best assures full compensation the court may not only award damages but also order other forms of redress such as the publication of a notice in newspapers designated by it eg in case of breach of a clause prohibiting competition or the reopening of a business defamation etc article 743 certainty of harm 1 compensation is due only for harm including future harm that is established with a reasonable degree of certainty 2 compensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence 3 where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty the assessment is at the discretion of the court damages art 743 275 comment 1 occurrence of harm must be reasonably certain this article reaffirms the wellknown requirement of certainty of harm since it is not possible to require the nonperforming party to compensate harm which may not have occurred or which may never occur paragraph 1 permits the compensation also of future harm ie harm which has not yet occurred provided that it is sufficiently certain paragraph 2 in addition covers loss of a chance obviously only in proportion to the probability of its occurrence thus the owner of a horse which arrives too late to run in a race as a result of delay in transport cannot recover the whole of the prize money even though the horse was the favourite 2 determination of extent of harm certainty relates not only to the existence of the harm but also to its extent there may be harm the existence of which cannot be disputed but which it is difficult to quantify this will often be the case in respect of loss of a chance there are not always odds as there are for a horse for example for an engineering company preparing for the making of a bid or of compensation for nonmaterial harm detriment to someones reputation pain and suffering etc i l l u s t r a t i o n a entrusts a file to b an express delivery company in response to an invitation to submit tenders for the construction of an airport b undertakes to deliver the file before the closing date for tenders but delivers it after that date and as application is refused the amount of compensation will depend upon the degree of probability of as tender having been accepted and calls for a comparison of it with the applications which were admitted for consideration the compensation will therefore be calculated as a proportion of the profit which a might have made according to paragraph 3 where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty then rather than refuse any compensation or award nominal damages the court is empowered to make an equitable quantification of the harm sustained art 744 unidroit principles 276 3 harm must be a direct consequence of nonperformance as well as certain there is a clear connection between the certainty and the direct nature of the harm although the latter requirement is not expressly dealt with by the principles it is implicit in article 7421 which refers to the harm sustained as a result of the nonperformance and which therefore presupposes a sufficient causal link between the non performance and the harm harm which is too indirect will usually also be uncertain as well as unforeseeable article 744 foreseeability of harm the nonperforming party is liable only for harm which it foresaw or could reasonably have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract as being likely to result from its non performance comment the principle of limitation of recoverable harm to that which is foreseeable corresponds to the solution adopted in article 74 cisg this limitation is related to the very nature of the contract not all the benefits of which the aggrieved party is deprived fall within the scope of the contract and the nonperforming party must not be saddled with compensation for harm which it could never have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract and against the risk of which it could not have taken out insurance the requirement of foreseeability must be seen in conjunction with that of certainty of harm set out in article 743 the concept of foreseeability must be clarified since the solution contained in the principles does not correspond to certain national systems which allow compensation even for harm which is unforeseeable when the nonperformance is due to wilful misconduct or gross negligence since the present rule does not provide for such an exception a narrow interpretation of the concept of foreseeability is called for foreseeability relates to the nature or type of the harm but not to its extent unless the extent is such as to transform the harm into one of a different kind in any event foreseeability is a flexible concept which leaves a wide measure of discretion to the judge damages art 745 277 what was foreseeable is to be determined by reference to the time of the conclusion of the contract and to the nonperforming party itself including its servants or agents and the test is what a normally diligent person could reasonably have foreseen as the consequences of non performance in the ordinary course of things and the particular circumstances of the contract such as the information supplied by the parties or their previous transactions i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a cleaning company orders a machine which is delivered five months late the manufacturer is obliged to compensate the company for lost profit caused by the delay in delivery as it could have foreseen that the machine was intended for immediate use on the other hand the harm does not include the loss of a valuable government contract that could have been concluded if the machine had been delivered on time since that kind of harm was not foreseeable 2 a a bank usually employs the services of a security company for the conveyance of bags containing coins to its branches without informing the security company a sends a consignment of bags containing new coins for collectors worth fifty times the value of previous consignments the bags are stolen in a holdup a can only recover compensation corresponding to the value of the normal consignments as this was the only kind of harm that could have been foreseen and the value of the items lost was such as to transform the harm into one of another kind unlike certain international conventions particularly in the field of transport the principles follow cisg in not making provision for full compensation of harm albeit unforeseeable in the event of intentional nonperformance article 745 proof of harm in case of replacement transaction where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has made a replacement transaction within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner it may recover the difference between the contract price and the price of the replacement transaction as well as damages for any further harm art 745 unidroit principles 278 comment 1 amount of harm presumed in case of replacement transaction it seems advisable to establish alongside the general rules applicable to the proof of the existence and of the amount of the harm presumptions which may facilitate the task of the aggrieved party the first of these presumptions is provided by this article which corresponds in substance to article 75 cisg it concerns the situation where the aggrieved party has made a replacement transaction for instance because so required by the duty to mitigate harm or in conformity with usages in such cases the harm is considered to be the difference between the contract price and the price of the replacement transaction the presumption comes into play only if there is a replacement trans action and not where the aggrieved party has itself performed the obligation which lay upon the nonperforming party for example when a shipowner itself carries out the repairs to its vessel following the failure to do so of the shipyard which had been entrusted with the work nor is there replacement and the general rules will apply when a company after the termination of a contract uses its equipment for the performance of another contract which it could have performed at the same time as the first lost volume the replacement transaction must be performed within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner so as to avoid the nonperforming party being prejudiced by hasty or malicious conduct 2 further damages recoverable for additional harm the rule that the aggrieved party may recover the difference between the two contract prices establishes a minimum right of recovery the aggrieved party may also obtain damages for additional harm which it may have sustained i l l u s t r a t i o n a a shipyard undertakes to accommodate a ship belonging to b a shipowner in dry dock for repairs costing usd 500000 as from 1 july b learns on 1 june that the dry dock will only be available as from 1 august b terminates the contract and after lengthy and costly negotiations concludes with c another shipyard an identical contract at a price of usd 700000 b is entitled to recover from a not only the difference in the price of usd 200000 but also the expenses it has incurred and compensation for the longer period of unavailability of the ship damages art 746 279 article 746 proof of harm by current price 1 where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has not made a replacement transaction but there is a current price for the performance contracted for it may recover the difference between the contract price and the price current at the time the contract is terminated as well as damages for any further harm 2 current price is the price generally charged for goods delivered or services rendered in comparable circumstances at the place where the contract should have been performed or if there is no current price at that place the current price at such other place that appears reasonable to take as a reference comment 1 amount of harm presumed when no replacement transaction the purpose of this article which corresponds in substance to article 76 cisg is to facilitate proof of harm where no replacement transaction has been made but there exists a current price for the performance contracted for in such cases the harm is presumed to be equal to the difference between the contract price and the price current at the time the contract was terminated 2 determination of current price according to paragraph 2 current price is the price generally charged for the goods or services in question the price will be determined in comparison with that which is charged for the same or similar goods or services this will often but not necessarily be the price on an organised market evidence of the current price may be obtained from professional organisations chambers of commerce etc for the purpose of this article the place relevant for determining the current price is that where the contract should have been performed or if there is no current price at that place the place that appears reasonable to take as a reference art 747 unidroit principles 280 3 further damages recoverable for additional harm the rule that the aggrieved party may recover the difference between the contract price and the current price at the time of termination establishes only a minimum right of recovery the aggrieved party may also obtain damages for additional harm which it may have sustained as a consequence of termination article 747 harm due in part to aggrieved party where the harm is due in part to an act or omission of the aggrieved party or to another event for which that party bears the risk the amount of damages shall be reduced to the extent that these factors have contributed to the harm having regard to the conduct of each of the parties comment 1 contribution of the aggrieved party to the harm in application of the general principle established by article 712 which restricts the exercise of remedies where nonperformance is in part due to the conduct of the aggrieved party this article limits the right to damages to the extent that the aggrieved party has in part contributed to the harm it would indeed be unjust for such a party to obtain full compensation for harm for which it has itself been partly responsible 2 ways of contributing to the harm the contribution of the aggrieved party to the harm may consist either in its own conduct or in an event for which it bears the risk the conduct may take the form of an act eg it gave a carrier a mistaken address or an omission eg it failed to give all the necessary instruct tions to the constructor of the defective machinery most frequently such acts or omissions will result in the aggrieved party failing to perform one or another of its own contractual obligations they may however equally consist in tortious conduct or nonperformance of damages art 747 281 another contract the external events for which the aggrieved party bears the risk may among others be acts or omissions of persons for whom it is responsible such as its servants or agents i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a franchisee bound by an exclusivity clause contained in the contract with b acquires stock from c because b has required immediate payment despite the fact that the franchise agreement provides for payment at 90 days b claims payment of the penalty stipulated for breach of the exclusivity clause b will obtain only part of the sum due thereunder as it was b who provoked as non performance 2 a a passenger on a liner effecting a luxury cruise is injured when a lift fails to stop at the floor requested b the shipowner is held liable for the consequences of as injury and seeks recourse against c the company which had checked the lifts before the liners departure it is proved that the accident would have been avoided if the floor had been better lit since this was bs responsibility b will not obtain full recovery from c 3 apportionment of contribution to the harm the conduct of the aggrieved party or the external events as to which it bears the risk may have made it absolutely impossible for the non performing party to perform if the requirements of article 717 force majeure are satisfied the nonperforming party is totally exonerated from liability otherwise the exoneration will be partial depending on the extent to which the aggrieved party contributed to the harm the determination of each partys contribution to the harm may well prove to be difficult and will to a large degree depend upon the exercise of judicial discretion in order to give some guidance to the court this article provides that the court shall have regard to the respective behaviour of the parties the more serious a partys failing the greater will be its contribution to the harm i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 since it was b who was the first not to observe the terms of the contract b is deemed to have caused as failure to respect the exclusivity clause b may only recover 25 of the amount stipulated in the penalty clause art 748 unidroit principles 282 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 since the failings of b and c seem to be equivalent b can only recover from c 50 of the compensation it had to pay a 4 contribution to harm and mitigation of harm this article must be read in conjunction with the following article on mitigation of harm see article 748 while this article is concerned with the conduct of the aggrieved party in regard to the cause of the initial harm article 748 relates to that partys conduct subsequent thereto article 748 mitigation of harm 1 the nonperforming party is not liable for harm suffered by the aggrieved party to the extent that the harm could have been reduced by the latter partys taking reasonable steps 2 the aggrieved party is entitled to recover any expenses reasonably incurred in attempting to reduce the harm comment 1 duty of aggrieved party to mitigate harm the purpose of this article is to avoid the aggrieved party passively sitting back and waiting to be compensated for harm which it could have avoided or reduced any harm which the aggrieved party could have avoided by taking reasonable steps will not be compensated evidently a party who has already suffered the consequences of non performance of the contract cannot be required in addition to take time consuming and costly measures on the other hand it would be unreasonable from the economic standpoint to permit an increase in harm which could have been reduced by the taking of reasonable steps the steps to be taken by the aggrieved party may be directed either to limiting the extent of the harm above all when there is a risk of it lasting for a long time if such steps are not taken often they will consist in a replacement transaction see article 745 or to avoiding any increase in the initial harm damages art 748 283 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 on 2 may a requests b a travel agency to reserve a hotel room in city x for 1 june at a cost of eur 200 on 15 may a learns that b has not made the reservation a waits however until 25 may before making a new reservation and can only find a room costing eur 300 whereas accommodation could have been secured for eur 250 if a had taken action already on 15 may a can recover only eur 50 from b 2 a a company which has been entrusted by b with the building of a factory suddenly stops work when the project is nearing completion b looks for another company to finish the building of the factory but takes no steps to protect the buildings on the site the condition of which deteriorates as a result of bad weather b cannot recover compensation for such deterioration as it is attributable to its failure to take interim protective measures 2 reimbursement of expenses the reduction in damages to the extent that the aggrieved party has failed to take the necessary steps to mitigate the harm must not however cause loss to that party the aggrieved party may therefore recover from the nonperforming party the expenses incurred by it in mitigating the harm provided that those expenses were reasonable in the circumstances paragraph 2 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 except that b has the necessary work carried out to ensure the interim protection of the buildings the cost of such work will be added to the damages due by a for nonperformance of the contract on condition that those costs were reasonable if they were not they will be reduced 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that a takes a room costing eur 500 in a luxury hotel a may only recover the 50 euro difference in respect of the room which a could have obtained for eur 250 art 749 unidroit principles 284 article 749 interest for failure to pay money 1 if a party does not pay a sum of money when it falls due the aggrieved party is entitled to interest upon that sum from the time when payment is due to the time of payment whether or not the nonpayment is excused 2 the rate of interest shall be the average bank shortterm lending rate to prime borrowers prevailing for the currency of payment at the place for payment or where no such rate exists at that place then the same rate in the state of the currency of payment in the absence of such a rate at either place the rate of interest shall be the appropriate rate fixed by the law of the state of the currency of payment 3 the aggrieved party is entitled to additional damages if the nonpayment caused it a greater harm comment 1 lump sum compensation for failure to pay a sum of money this article reaffirms the widely accepted rule according to which the harm resulting from delay in the payment of a sum of money is subject to a special regime and is calculated by a lump sum corresponding to the interest accruing between the time when payment of the money was due and the time of actual payment interest is payable whenever the delay in payment is attributable to the nonperforming party and this as from the time when payment was due without any need for the aggrieved party to give notice of the default if the delay is the consequence of force majeure eg the non performing party is prevented from obtaining the sum due by reason of the introduction of new exchange control regulations interest will still be due not as damages but as compensation for the enrichment of the debtor as a result of the nonpayment as the debtor continues to receive interest on the sum which it is prevented from paying the harm is calculated as a lump sum in other words subject to paragraph 3 of this article the aggrieved party may not prove that it damages art 749 285 could have invested the sum due at a higher rate of interest or the non performing party that the aggrieved party would have obtained interest at a rate lower than the average lending rate referred to in paragraph 2 the parties may of course agree in advance on a different rate of interest which would in effect subject it to article 7413 2 rate of interest paragraph 2 of this article fixes in the first instance as the rate of interest the average bank shortterm lending rate to prime borrowers this solution seems to be that best suited to the needs of international trade and most appropriate to ensure an adequate compensation of the harm sustained the rate in question is the rate at which the aggrieved party will normally borrow the money which it has not received from the nonperforming party that normal rate is the average bank short term lending rate to prime borrowers prevailing at the place for payment for the currency of payment no such rate may however exist for the currency of payment at the place for payment in such cases reference is made in the first instance to the average prime rate in the state of the currency of payment for instance if a loan is made in pounds sterling payable in country x and there is no rate for loans in pounds on country x financial market reference will be made to the rate in the united kingdom in the absence of such a rate at either place the rate of interest will be the appropriate rate fixed by the law of the state of the currency of payment in most cases this will be the legal rate of interest and as there may be more than one that most appropriate for international transactions if there is no legal rate of interest the rate will be the most appropriate bank rate 3 additional damages recoverable interest is intended to compensate the harm normally sustained as a consequence of delay in payment of a sum of money such delay may however cause additional harm to the aggrieved party for which it may recover damages always provided that it can prove the existence of such harm and that it meets the requirements of certainty and foreseeability paragraph 3 art 7410 unidroit principles 286 i l l u s t r a t i o n a concludes a contract with b a specialised finance company for a loan which will permit the renovation of its factory in country x the loan specifically mentions the use of the funds the money lent is transferred three months later than agreed during that period the cost of the renovation has increased by ten percent a is entitled to recover this additional sum from b article 7410 interest on damages unless otherwise agreed interest on damages for nonperformance of nonmonetary obligations accrues as from the time of non performance comment this article determines the time from which interest on damages accrues in cases of nonperformance of obligations other than monetary obligations in such cases at the time of nonperformance the amount of damages will usually not yet have been assessed in monetary terms the assessment will only be made after the occurrence of the harm either by agreement between the parties or by the court this article fixes as the starting point for the accrual of interest the date of the occurrence of the harm this solution is that best suited to international trade where it is not the practice for businesspersons to leave their money idle in effect the aggrieved partys assets are diminished as from the occurrence of the harm whereas the non performing party for as long as the damages are not paid continues to enjoy the benefit of the interest on the sum which it will have to pay it is only natural that this gain passes to the aggrieved party however when making the final assessment of the harm regard is to be had to the fact that damages are awarded as from the date of the harm so as to avoid double compensation for instance when a currency depreciates in value this article takes no stand on the question of compound interest which in some national laws is subject to rules of public policy limiting compound interest with a view to protecting the nonperforming party damages art 7411 287 article 7411 manner of monetary redress 1 damages are to be paid in a lump sum however they may be payable in instalments where the nature of the harm makes this appropriate 2 damages to be paid in instalments may be indexed comment 1 lump sum or instalments although this article does not impose a fixed rule as to the manner in which damages are to be paid the payment of damages as a lump sum is in general considered to be the mode of payment best suited to international trade there are however situations in which payment by instalments will be more appropriate having regard to the nature of the harm for instance when the harm is ongoing i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a consultant is retained by b for the purpose of checking the safety of its factories a is killed when travelling by helicopter to one of bs factories for which accident b is held responsible a leaves two children aged twelve and eight so as to compensate for the loss of the maintenance of the family a monthly allowance will be payable to the children until they reach the age of majority 2 a a consultant in safety matters is recruited by b for a three year period the remuneration is fixed at 05 of the production a is wrongfully dismissed after six months it may be appropriate that b be ordered to pay a monthly a sum corresponding to the agreed salary until a has found new employment or at the most for thirty months 2 indexation paragraph 2 of this article contemplates the possibility of indexation of damages to be paid in instalments so as to avoid the complex mechanism of a review of the original judgment in order to take account of inflation indexation may however be prohibited by the law of the forum art 7412 unidroit principles 288 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 the monthly allowance may be adjusted in accordance with the cost of living index applicable where the children live article 7412 currency in which to assess damages damages are to be assessed either in the currency in which the monetary obligation was expressed or in the currency in which the harm was suffered whichever is more appropriate comment the harm resulting from the nonperformance of an international contract may occur in different places and the question therefore arises of the currency in which it is to be assessed this question is dealt with by this article and should be kept distinct from that of the currency of payment of the damages addressed in article 619 the article offers a choice between the currency in which the monetary obligation was expressed and that in which the harm was suffered whichever is more appropriate in the circumstances while the first alternative calls for no particular comment the second takes account of the fact that the aggrieved party may have incurred expenses in a particular currency to repair damage which it has sustained in such a case it should be entitled to claim damages in that currency even if it is not the currency of the contract another currency which may be considered the most appropriate is that in which the profit would have been made the choice is left to the aggrieved party provided that the principle of full compensation is respected finally it may be noted that in the absence of any indication to the contrary a party is entitled to interest and to liquidated damages and penalties in the same currency as that in which the main obligation is expressed damages art 7413 289 article 7413 agreed payment for nonperformance 1 where the contract provides that a party who does not perform is to pay a specified sum to the aggrieved party for such non performance the aggrieved party is entitled to that sum irrespective of its actual harm 2 however notwithstanding any agree ment to the contrary the specified sum may be reduced to a reasonable amount where it is grossly excessive in relation to the harm resulting from the nonperformance and to the other circumstances comment 1 agreed payment for nonperformance defined this article gives an intentionally broad definition of agreements to pay a specified sum in case of nonperformance whether such agreements be intended to facilitate the recovery of damages liquidated damages according to the common law or to operate as a deterrent against nonperformance penalty clauses proper or both 2 agreed payment for nonperformance in principle valid national laws vary considerably with respect to the validity of the type of clauses in question ranging from their acceptance in the civil law countries with or without the possibility of judicial review of particularly onerous clauses to the outright rejection in common law systems of clauses intended specifically to operate as a deterrent against nonperformance ie penalty clauses in view of their frequency in international contract practice paragraph 1 of this article in principle acknowledges the validity of any clauses providing that a party who does not perform is to pay a specified sum to the aggrieved party for such nonperformance with the consequence that the latter is entitled to the agreed sum irrespective of the harm actually suffered by it the nonperforming party may not allege that the aggrieved party sustained less harm or none at all art 7413 unidroit principles 290 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a former international football player from country x is recruited for three years to train the players of b a football team from country y at a monthly salary of aud 10000 provision is made for a severance allowance of aud 200000 in the event of unjustified dismissal a is dismissed without any justification after six months a is entitled to the agreed sum even though a was immediately recruited by another team at double the salary received from b normally the nonperformance must be one for which the non performing party is liable since it is difficult to conceive a clause providing for the payment of an agreed sum in case of nonperformance operating in a force majeure situation exceptionally however such a clause may be intended by the parties also to cover nonperformance for which the nonperforming party is not liable in the case of partial nonperformance the amount may unless otherwise agreed by the parties be reduced in proportion 3 agreed sum may be reduced in order to prevent the possibility of abuse to which such clauses may give rise paragraph 2 of this article permits the reduction of the agreed sum if it is grossly excessive in relation to the harm resulting from the nonperformance and to the other circumstances the same paragraph makes it clear that the parties may under no circumstances exclude such a possibility of reduction the agreed sum may only be reduced but not entirely disregarded as would be the case were the judge notwithstanding the agreement of the parties to award damages corresponding to the exact amount of the harm it may not be increased at least under this article where the agreed sum is lower than the harm actually sustained see however comment 4 on article 716 it is moreover necessary that the amount agreed be grossly excessive ie that it would clearly appear to be so to any reasonable person regard should in particular be had to the relationship between the sum agreed and the harm actually sustained i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a enters into a contract with b for the purchase of machinery which provides for payment in five instalments of eur 50000 each the contract contains a clause allowing immediate termination in the event of nonpayment by a of one instalment and authorises b to keep the sums already paid and to recover future instalments as damages a fails to pay the third instalment b keeps the eur 100000 already paid and claims in addition to the return of the damages art 7413 291 machinery the eur 150000 representing the three outstanding instalments the court will reduce the amount since as non performance would result in a grossly excessive benefit for b 4 agreed payment for nonperformance to be distinguished from forfeiture and other similar clauses the type of clauses dealt with in this article must be distinguished from forfeiture and other similar clauses which permit a party to withdraw from a contract either by paying a certain sum or by losing a deposit already made on the other hand a clause according to which the aggrieved party may retain sums already paid as part of the price falls within the scope of this article i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 a undertakes to sell real estate to b for eur 450000 b must exercise the option to purchase within three months and must pay a deposit of eur 25000 which a is entitled to retain if b does not exercise the option since this is not an agreed payment for non performance it does not fall under this article and the sum cannot be reduced thereunder even if grossly excessive in the circumstances 4 a enters into a contract with b for the lease of a machine the contract provides that in the event of as failure to pay one single rental the contract will be terminated and that the sums already paid will be retained by b as damages the clause falls under this article and the agreed amount may be subject to reduction 292 chapter 8 setoff article 81 conditions of setoff 1 where two parties owe each other money or other performances of the same kind either of them the first party may set off its obligation against that of its obligee the other party if at the time of setoff a the first party is entitled to perform its obligation b the other partys obligation is ascer tained as to its existence and amount and performance is due 2 if the obligations of both parties arise from the same contract the first party may also set off its obligation against an obligation of the other party which is not ascertained as to its existence or to its amount comment 1 use of setoff under the principles when two parties owe each other an obligation arising from a contract or any cause of action each party may set off its obligation against the obligation of the other party by mutual deduction both obligations are discharged up to the amount of the lesser obligation see article 85 setoff avoids the need for each party to perform its obligation separately the obligor from whom payment is asked and who sets off its own obligation is called the first party the obligee who first asks its obligor for payment and against whom the right of setoff is exercised is called the other party setoff art 81 293 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a a sea carrier has carried goods belonging to b from country x to country y a asks b for eur 10000 as payment for the carriage b who had previously become an obligee of a for an amount of eur 10000 as compensation for harm to other goods carried may set off its own obligation to pay a eur 10000 against as obligation to pay it eur 10000 if it does so neither a nor b will remain the others obligor 2 a sells b a plot of land for the price of aud 100000 subsequently b who is a contractor builds a house for a the price of the construction is aud 200000 when a asks for the payment of the land b may set off the price of the construction the obligation of b to pay a aud 100000 is totally discharged but a remains bs obligor for aud 100000 for a party to be allowed to set off its own obligation against the obligation of the other party the conditions laid down in this article must be satisfied 2 obligation owed to each other a first condition is that each party is the obligor and the obligee of the other paragraph 1 opening sentence to be noted is that the parties must be so in the same capacity thus setoff is not possible if the first party has an obligation to the other party in its own name but is the obligee of the other party in another capacity for example as a trustee or as the absolute owner of a company i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 company a sells company b machinery for 600000 japanese yen jpy b which is in business with company c a subsidiary of a sells c products for jpy 500000 when a asks b to pay the sales price of the machinery b cannot set off its obligation for the sale of the products to c even if the capital of c is totally subscribed by a as c is an independent entity a and b are not obligor and obligee of each other the condition that the obligations must be owed to each other may give rise to a problem where the other party has assigned the obligation owed to it by the first party to a third party the first party may nonetheless set off its obligation against the other partys obligation if the right of setoff existed against the assignors obligation before the assignment was notified to the obligor see article 9113 art 81 unidroit principles 294 3 obligations of the same kind both obligations must be of the same kind paragraph 1 opening sentence in some legal systems obligations have to be fungible a monetary obligation may be set off only against a monetary obligation a delivery of grain may be set off only against a delivery of grain of the same kind the concept of obligations of the same kind is broader than that of fungible obligations performances of nonmonetary obligations may be of the same kind while at the same time not being fungible two obligations to deliver wine of the same vineyard but not of the same year may be obligations of the same kind but would not be fungible cash and securities are not performances of the same kind in the sense of this article nevertheless as is the case with different foreign currencies set off may be exercised if the securities are easily convertible and if there is no agreement to the effect that only the payment of specified cash or securities is possible whether or not obligations are of the same kind may depend on commercial practices or special trade rules a personal obligation cannot be of the same kind as another type of obligation setoff is thus not available if one of the obligations is of a personal nature i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 a a crude oil producer contracts to deliver 1500 tonnes of crude oil by pipeline every month to b in country x b in turn must each week transfer 1000 tonnes of crude oil by road the crude oil produced by a and the crude oil delivered by b do not have the same origin and are not totally similar but as their use could be identical the two obligations relating to the crude oil can be said to be of the same kind and if a and b are obligor and obligee for the delivery of some quantity of crude oil setoff will be available 5 a holds 100 ordinary shares of the company c shareholder b of the same company holds 120 redeemable preferred shares they are obligee and obligor of each other and in an earlier contract it was provided that payment would be possible by means of shares of equal value since the shares held by a and the shares held by b are not of the same kind setoff cannot be exercised 4 first partys obligation performable the first party must have the right to perform its obligation paragraph 1a it cannot impose on the other party a performance which either has not yet been ascertained or is not yet due setoff art 81 295 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 6 a has sold ten trucks to b for usd 1000000 b must pay for the trucks before 30 september b wishes to set off an obligation it has towards a arising from a loan to a repayment of which is due on 30 november before this date b may not set off its obligation towards a as it cannot pay a before 30 november bs obligation to a is not yet due 7 a owes b eur 200000 for the repayment of a loan the repayment must take place on 30 january b is obliged to pay a for a claim for damages of eur 140000 under a judgment handed down on 25 january a asks b to pay on 9 february b whose obligation can be performed is allowed to set off its obligation against as obligation 8 a has sold b 10000 bottles of wine the price of which must be paid at the latest on 30 october b is also as obligee and as obligation is already due b may set off its own obligation against as obligation on 10 october even if the latest date bs obligation should be paid is 30 october because a is bound to accept a payment before such date 5 other partys obligation ascertained setoff may be exercised only when the other partys obligation is ascertained both as to its existence and as to its amount paragraph 1b the existence of an obligation is ascertained when the obligation itself cannot be contested for example when it is based on a valid and executed contract or a final judgment or award which is not subject to review conversely an obligation to pay damages is not ascertained when the obligation may be contested by the other party even if the existence of the other partys obligation is not contested it is not possible to exercise setoff if the obligation is not ascertained as to its amount if the existence of the harm is not disputed but the amount of the compensation has not been fixed setoff will not be available i l l u s t r a t i o n s 9 a judgment requires a to pay b 200000 chinese yuan renminbi cny for breach of contract b is in turn as obligor for the repayment of a loan of cny 240000 repayment of which is already due a asks b to pay the cny 240000 b may set off its obligation against as obligation arising from the judgment art 81 unidroit principles 296 10 a sells b a yacht for eur 300000 a is liable to b for tort the harm is not contested but the amount of damages has not yet been fixed a will not be permitted to set off its own obligation as as obligation has not been ascertained the principles do not deal with the impact of insolvency proceedings on the right to exercise setoff which is therefore to be determined by the applicable law most domestic laws grant the first party the right to exercise setoff even after the other party has become involved in insolvency proceedings thereby derogating from the principle of the equality of the creditors in insolvency proceedings 6 other partys obligation due the other partys obligation must furthermore be due paragraph 1b an obligation is due when the obligee has the right to request performance by the obligor and the obligor has no available defence against that request a defence will for example be available if the time of payment has not yet arrived as a natural or moral obligation is not enforceable the first party may not set off its obligations against such an obligation owed by the other party the enforceability or non enforceability of an obligation may depend on the otherwise applicable law consequently in some cases the possibility to exercise the right of setoff may depend on the otherwise applicable law i l l u s t r a t i o n 11 by a final judgment of 10 april a was ordered to pay b usd 20000 for the sale of cotton a who is bs obligee for the repayment of a loan of usd 12000 which was enforceable as from 10 january may set off its own obligation against bs obligation b whose obligation is ascertained and due cannot contest the setoff exercised by a since the expiration of the limitation periods prevents the enforce ment of the obligation but does not extinguish the right itself the first party who is not allowed to enforce the timebarred obligation may nonetheless set off that timebarred obligation see article 1010 7 setoff of obligations arising from the same contract setoff is a convenient means of discharging obligations at once and at the same time therefore if the two obligations arise from the same contract the conditions of setoff are modified if the obligations of the two parties arise from the same contract the first party is allowed to set off its own obligation against an obligation of the other party even where that other partys obligation is not setoff art 81 297 ascertained as to its existence or to its amount paragraph 2 thus for instance an obligation to pay damages may be ascertained as to its existence but not as to its amount if the minimum amount payable cannot be contested the first party may set off its own obligation up to that minimum amount even if the total amount of the other partys obligation is unknown even though one of the obligations is contested the right to setoff can be exercised because all the relevant obligations capable of being set off arise from the same contract and can therefore be easily identified this could be useful to parties in a business relationship to facilitate quick settlements of claims judicial intervention may however be necessary to determine whether the conditions of setoff are in fact satisfied in international commerce the obligations of the two parties may frequently arise from the same contract i l l u s t r a t i o n s 12 a carries turkeys for b from country x to country y the carriage charge is 35000 russian roubles rub during the carriage one hundred turkeys die due to the fault of the carrier which it acknowledges a asks b for the payment of the carriage b may set off the obligation to pay for the harm caused by the loss of the turkeys against as obligation although the amount of the damages is not ascertained it would be easy to estimate the damages and determine if the conditions for set off are satisfied as the two obligations arise from the same contract 13 a a carrier accepts to carry a piano for pianist b from country x to country y a provision of the contract expressly provides that delay penalties are to be paid if the piano is not delivered at the concert hall five days before the date of the concert the piano is delivered at the place of destination only two days before the date of the concert a asks for the payment of the carriage b may set off its claim for the agreed delay penalties against as claim even if a contests the amount of the penalties owed for the delay 8 setoff by agreement even if the conditions of this article are not met the parties may achieve the effects of setoff by agreement likewise parties may agree that their mutual obligations are set off automatically either at a art 82 unidroit principles 298 specific date or periodically also more than two parties may agree that their respective obligations shall be discharged for example by netting article 82 foreign currency setoff where the obligations are to pay money in different currencies the right of setoff may be exercised provided that both currencies are freely convertible and the parties have not agreed that the first party shall pay only in a specified currency comment 1 convertible currencies payments in different currencies are not performances of the same kind as required by article 81 however if the payments are to be made in currencies that are both convertible setoff may nevertheless be exercised according to article 619 if there is no agreement to the contrary payment may be made by the obligor in the currency of the place for payment if this currency is convertible on the contrary since the relative value of a currency that is not freely convertible cannot be readily ascertained for the purpose of setoff setoff cannot be used to impose payment in such a currency on the other party i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a a wine producer in country x sells 5000 bottles of wine for usd 200000 to b a cork producer b sells 100000 corks to a for the price of 100000 livros which is the currency of the country where corks are produced and which is not convertible a asks b for payment of the usd 200000 b may not set off the 100000 livros against the usd 200000 2 currency specified by contract if a contract expressly requires a party to pay in a specified currency and if the other party has to perform its own obligation in a currency different from that currency it will not be able to set off its own obligation against the other partys obligation setoff art 84 299 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a sells b products for usd 100000 the sales contract expressly provides that the price is to be paid by the buyer in us dollars b an asian carrier is as obligee for an unpaid invoice for carriage charges which must be paid in korean won a requires payment of the usd 100000 b who contractually is obliged to pay the price of the products in us dollars is not allowed to set off its obligation against the obligation of a to pay the carriage charges article 83 setoff by notice the right of setoff is exercised by notice to the other party comment the right of setoff is exercised by notice to the other party it does not operate automatically or by declaration of the court the first party must inform the other party that it will discharge its own obligation by setoff notice must not be conditional to be effective notice must be sent after the conditions for setoff are fulfilled notice may be given by any means appropriate to the circumstances and is effective when it reaches the person to whom it is given see article 110 article 84 content of notice 1 the notice must specify the obligations to which it relates 2 if the notice does not specify the obligation against which setoff is exercised the other party may within a reasonable time declare to the first party the obligation to which setoff relates if no such declaration is made the setoff will relate to all the obligations proportionally art 84 unidroit principles 300 comment according to paragraph 1 the notice must specify the obligations of both parties that are to be set off the other party receiving the notice must know the grounds for setoff and the amount of setoff 1 declaration by the other party if the first party has two or more obligations against the other party and if the first party has not specified the obligations it wants to be paid by setoff the other party may freely choose which of the first partys obligations it wants to be discharged paragraph 2 first part i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a regularly sells b cloth on 30 december b asks a for the payment of usd 50000 that a owes it at that date b owes a the payment of the price relating to three different sales contracts ie usd 40000 usd 35000 and usd 45000 respectively if a wants to set off bs obligation it has to indicate in the notice which of the three obligations owed by b it wants to set off if a does not indicate in the notice which obligation owed by b it wants to set off b may in a reasonable time indicate to a that its obligation of usd 45000 will be totally discharged by set off and that the obligation of usd 35000 will be discharged up to usd 5000 after setoff has been applied b remains the obligor of a for usd 70000 2 absence of declaration if the notice does not specify the obligations that the first party wants to set off and if the other party does not make any declaration as to which obligation setoff relates within a reasonable time all the obligations of the other party will be discharged by setoff proportionally up to the value of the first partys obligation paragraph 2 second part i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b does not declare to which obligation setoff relates in the absence of such a declaration setoff will discharge the obligation of usd 40000 of the first contract up to usd 16670 the obligation of usd 35000 of the second contract up to usd 14580 and the obligation of usd 45000 of the third contract up to usd 18750 setoff art 85 301 article 85 effect of setoff 1 setoff discharges the obligations 2 if obligations differ in amount setoff discharges the obligations up to the amount of the lesser obligation 3 setoff takes effect as from the time of notice comment 1 discharge by setoff if the conditions of setoff specified in article 81 are satisfied the obligations of both parties are discharged to the extent of the setoff as if two reciprocal payments had been made i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a owes usd 100000 to b and b owes usd 100000 to a b asks for the payment of its obligation a by notice declares to b that it sets off its own obligation after setoff takes effect the two obligations are discharged if the two obligations differ in their amount setoff will discharge the obligations but only up to the amount of the lesser obligation i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 b owes usd 100000 to a who in turn owes b usd 70000 a asks for the payment of the usd 100000 it is owed b declares that it wants to set off as obligation of usd 70000 if the conditions for setoff are met a is no longer the obligor of b as its obligation has been entirely discharged but a is still the obligee of b for usd 30000 corresponding to the part of the obligation not paid by set off 2 setoff effective at the time of notice the obligations are discharged at the time of notice if at that time the conditions required for setoff are fulfilled setoff does not operate retroactively it has prospective effect only the date of effectiveness of setoff is consistent with the necessity to declare setoff by notice and in practice the date when setoff is effective will be easy to know art 85 unidroit principles 302 the situation has to be evaluated as if both obligations were paid at the time of notice two consequences derive from this rule firstly interest on the obligations runs until the time of notice a party who may and wants to set off its obligation must declare setoff as soon as possible if it wishes to stop the accrual of interest secondly if an undue payment has been made after setoff has been declared restitution will take place as the payment has no legal grounds if the payment had been made before the notice it is an effective payment and restitution cannot be required i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 a owes b usd 100000 dollars for goods sold by b as obligation is ascertained and payment is due on 20 november by a judgement dated 30 november b is ordered to pay a usd 80000 in damages the obligation to pay usd 80000 is due and ascertained at the date of the judgement ie on 30 november setoff is exercised by a by notice on 10 december the setoff will take place at the time of notice as all the conditions required have been satisfied before this date the two obligations are discharged up to the amount of the lesser obligation a will remain the obligee of b for usd 20000 after 10 december interest no longer accrues except on the amount of usd 20000 at the time when the conditions for setoff are satisfied and notice has been given not only are the principal obligations discharged but also related rights eg rights securing an obligation are discharged accordingly i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 a a banker had lent architect b eur 100000 and has obtained a personal security for the payment from bs wife b is the obligee of a for eur 120000 which is money that b holds on its account in as bank a asks b for the payment of the eur 100000 b declares setoff by notice on 12 december the conditions required for as obligation and bs obligation were fulfilled on 10 december at the date of notice on 12 december as and bs obligations are discharged as is the personal security given by bs wife 303 chapter 9 assignment of rights transfer of obligations assignment of contracts section 1 assignment of rights article 911 definitions assignment of a right means the transfer by agreement from one person the assignor to another person the assignee including transfer by way of security of the assignors right to payment of a monetary sum or other performance from a third person the obligor comment in many circumstances an obligee entitled to the payment of a monetary sum or to another performance from an obligor may find it useful to assign its right to another person for instance an assignment to a bank is a common way to finance the credit granted to a customer the articles of the present section cover the assignment of rights as defined in this article 1 transfer by agreement only transfers by agreement are concerned as opposed to situations in which the applicable law may provide for legal transfers of certain rights such as in certain jurisdictions the transfer of a sellers rights against an insurer to the purchaser of an insured building or the automatic transfer of rights in the case of the merger of companies see article 912b the definition equally does not cover unilateral transfers which in certain jurisdictions may take place without the assignees participation art 912 unidroit principles 304 2 right to payment of a monetary sum or to other performance on the other hand the definition is not restricted to the assignment of rights to the payment of a monetary sum it also covers rights to other kinds of performance such as the rendering of a service nor are the assignable rights limited to rights of a contractual nature claims deriving from noncontractual claims or based on a judgment for instance can be governed by the present section subject to article 14 future rights may also be transferred under the conditions of article 915 3 notion of transfer the transfer of the right means that it leaves the assignors assets to become part of those of the assignee the definition also covers transfers for security purposes 4 third party rights transfers from the assets of the assignor to those of the assignee remain subject to third party rights different third persons can be affected by the assignment of a right between an assignor and an assignee such as first and foremost the obligor but also the assignors creditors and successive assignees third party rights are covered in part by other provisions of this section see articles 9110 and 9111 concerning the obligor and successive assignees they may in some instances be governed by mandatory rules of the otherwise applicable law eg the law of bankruptcy article 912 exclusions this section does not apply to transfers made under the special rules governing the transfers a of instruments such as negotiable instruments documents of title or financial instruments or b of rights in the course of transferring a business assignment of rights art 912 305 comment some types of assignment of rights are normally subject to very specific rules under the applicable law and are therefore not governed by this section 1 transfer of instruments governed by special rules the transfer of certain types of instrument governed by special rules are outside the scope of this section this applies for instance to negotiable instruments such as bills of exchange that are usually transferred by endorsement or delivery of the document and which are subject to further distinct rules eg concerning defences that would have been available to the transferor this exclusion also applies to documents of title such as bills of lading or warehouse receipts and financial instruments such as stocks and bonds the transfer of such instruments are all normally subject to specific rules this does not exclude the possibility that such rights in certain jurisdictions could also be transferred by a normal assignment which would then be subject to this section 2 transfer of a business another exclusion is assignment made in the course of transferring a business under special rules governing such transfers as may happen in the case of the merger of companies the applicable law often provides for mechanisms that cause all rights and obligations under certain conditions to be transferred in their entirety by operation of law article 912b does not prevent this section from applying when certain rights pertaining to the transferred business are assigned individually on the contrary the mere transfer of shares in a company may fall under article 912a and therefore not be covered by this section i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company a is transferred to company b if the otherwise applicable law provides that all rights pertaining to the former company are automatically transferred to the latter the principles do not apply 2 the initial facts are the same as in illustration 1 but b is not interested in taking over a specific claim against customer x and prefers that right to be assigned to company c this particular transfer is subject to the principles art 913 unidroit principles 306 article 913 assignability of nonmonetary rights a right to nonmonetary performance may be assigned only if the assignment does not render the obligation significantly more burdensome comment the assignment of a right does not in principle affect the obligors rights and obligations however to a certain extent the fact that performance is now due to another obligee can modify the conditions under which the obligation is to be performed the place of performance may be different the change of obligee may in itself render the obligation more burdensome article 918 entitles the obligor to be compensated by the assignor or the assignee for any additional costs caused by the assignment that provision should be sufficient to take care of the problem in the case of the assignment of monetary obligations however when the assigned right concerns a nonmonetary performance the remedy may not always be sufficient this article excludes the possibility of assigning such rights when the transfer would render the obligation significantly more burdensome for the obligor i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company x has undertaken to provide the security service aimed at preventing theft in warehouses used by company a for the storage of wood the premises are sold to company b which intends to apply them to the same use nothing in this provision prevents a from assigning to b its right to the security services provided by x 2 the initial facts are the same as in illustration 1 but b intends to use the warehouses for the storage of electronic equipment as right to the security services provided by x may not be assigned to b such services would become significantly more burdensome since the security risks are obviously much higher with electronic equipment than with the storage of wood assignment of rights art 914 307 article 914 partial assignment 1 a right to the payment of a monetary sum may be assigned partially 2 a right to other performance may be assigned partially only if it is divisible and the assignment does not render the obligation signi ficantly more burdensome comment 1 economic interest the partial assignment of a right may serve different economic purposes a contractor may for instance want to assign part of its right to payment from a customer to a financing institution and keep the rest for itself or it may want to assign the other part to a supplier of raw materials permitting partial assignment may however affect the principle that the assignment should not worsen the obligors situation if the right is split the obligor will have to perform in several parts which could entail extra costs 2 monetary and nonmonetary rights the obligors burden of having to make two or several monetary payments instead of one is not in itself deemed to be excessive and partial assignments of monetary rights are therefore permitted in principle paragraph 1 another rule prevails for the assignment of nonmonetary rights where the validity of the partial assignment is made dependent on two cumulative conditions the divisibility of the performance due and the degree of additional burden the partial assignment may place on the obligor article 913 already excludes the possibility to assign non monetary rights in their entirety if the assignment would render the obligation significantly more burdensome paragraph 2 applies the same rule to the partial assignment of such rights in any event additional costs borne by the obligor as a result of having to perform in several parts must be compensated under article 918 art 915 unidroit principles 308 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 buyer x is due to pay a price of usd 1000000 to seller a on 31 october a urgently needs usd 600000 and assigns a corresponding part of its right to bank b notice of the partial assignment is given to x on 31 october both a and b claim payment of their respective parts x must pay a usd 400000 and b usd 600000 2 metal company x is to deliver 1000 tons of steel to carmaker a on 31 october due to a decrease in sales a estimates that it will not need that much steel at that time and assigns the right to delivery of up to 300 tons to carmaker b notice of the partial assignment is given to x on 31 october both a and b claim delivery of their respective quantities x must deliver 700 tons to a and 300 tons to b 3 tax consultant x has promised to spend 30 days in examining the accounts of company a in order to determine the proper policy to be followed in the light of new tax regulations a subsequently regrets this arrangement in consideration of the level of the fees to be paid it proposes to assign 15 of the days to company b x can argue against such a partial assignment on the grounds that performance of tasks of that nature is not divisible it can also argue that the accounts of b are of a significantly more complex nature than those of a article 915 future rights a future right is deemed to be transferred at the time of the agreement provided the right when it comes into existence can be identified as the right to which the assignment relates comment 1 economic interest for the purposes of this section a future right is a right that will or might come into existence in the future as opposed to a present right to a performance due in the future examples of future rights are rights that a bank may have against a customer who might be granted a credit line in the future or that a company may have against another assignment of rights art 916 309 company on the basis of a contract which might be concluded in the future the assignment of such future rights can be highly significant economically 2 determinability according to this article a future right can be assigned on condition that it can be determined as the right to which the assignment relates when it comes into existence the reason for this is the need to avoid the difficulties that might be caused by a transfer of future rights that are described in vague and too broad general terms 3 retroactive effect this article also provides that the assignment of future rights is effective with retroactivity between the assignor and the assignee when the right comes into existence the transfer is considered to have taken place at the time of the assignment agreement as regards third parties it will be recalled that their rights may in some instances be governed by mandatory rules of the otherwise applicable law eg the law of bankruptcy however third party rights are partly covered by other provisions of this section including the consequences of notices specified in articles 9110 and 9111 i l l u s t r a t i o n in order to finance new investments company a assigns the royalties to be earned from future licences of a certain technology to lending institution b six months later a licenses that technology to company x the royalties due are considered to have been assigned to b from the date of the assignment agreement provided the royalties can be related to this agreement article 916 rights assigned without individual specification a number of rights may be assigned without individual specification provided such rights can be identified as rights to which the assignment relates at the time of the assignment or when they come into existence art 917 unidroit principles 310 comment rights are often assigned as a bundle or in bulk a company may for instance assign all its receivables to a factoring company in practice it would be excessively burdensome to require individual specification of each assigned right but the global identification of the rights assigned as a bundle must be such as to permit the recognition of each right concerned as part of the assignment in the case of existing rights such recognition must be possible at the time of the assignment if future rights are included in the bundle in accordance with article 915 identification must be possible when the rights come into existence i l l u s t r a t i o n retailer a assigns all its receivables to factor b there are thousands of existing andor future rights the assignment does not require the specification of each single claim later b gives notice of the assignment to the obligor of a specific receivable b must be able to demonstrate the inclusion of that receivable in the bundle either at the time of the assignment or in the case of a right which did not exist yet at that time when the right came into existence article 917 agreement between assignor and assignee sufficient 1 a right is assigned by mere agreement between the assignor and the assignee without notice to the obligor 2 the consent of the obligor is not required unless the obligation in the circum stances is of an essentially personal character comment in the definition of article 911 the assignment of a right is described as a transfer by agreement articles 917 to 9115 govern the respective legal positions of assignor assignee and obligor assignment of rights art 917 311 1 mere agreement between assignor and assignee according to paragraph 1 of this article the assignment of a right is effective ie the right is transferred from the assignors assets to the assignees assets by mere agreement between these two parties the provision is an application to the assignment of a right of the general principle laid down in article 12 according to which nothing in the principles requires a contract to be concluded in a particular form yet it does not affect the possible application of mandatory rules of the otherwise applicable law according to article 14 thus for instance an assignment for security purposes may be subject to special requirements as to form as already stated in comment 4 on article 911 the rule laid down in paragraph 1 remains subject to third party rights which are partly covered by other provisions of this section see articles 9110 and 9111 concerning the obligor and successive assignees and may in some instances be governed by mandatory rules of the otherwise applicable law eg the law of bankruptcy according to article 14 however it should be stressed that notice to the obligor as provided for by article 9110 is not a condition for the effectiveness of the transfer of the rights between the assignor and the assignee 2 consent of the obligor in principle not required paragraph 2 states explicitly what is already implied in paragraph 1 ie that the obligors consent is not required for the assignment to be effective between the assignor and the assignee 3 exception obligation of an essentially personal character an exception is made for the case in which the right to be assigned relates to an obligation of an essentially personal character ie a right that has been granted by the obligor specifically to the person of the obligee this characteristic prevents the right from being assigned without the consent of the obligor since it would be inappropriate to oblige the obligor to perform in favour of another person i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company x promises to sponsor activities organised by organisation a engaged in the defence of human rights a wishes to assign the right to organisation b active in the protection of the environment the assignment can only take place with xs agreement art 918 unidroit principles 312 2 a famous soprano has made a contract with agent a to sing in concerts organised by a a sells its claims against the soprano to agent b this transfer will require the sopranos consent if the circumstances reveal that she was willing to sing only for a 4 effect of other provisions the possibility to assign a right without the obligors consent may be affected by the presence of a nonassignment clause in the contract between the assignor and the obligor see article 919 although such a clause does not in itself necessarily imply the essentially personal character of the obligation this article does not address the issue of the necessity to give notice of the assignment to the obligor in order to avoid that the obligor pay the assignor after the assignment has taken place on these issues see articles 9110 and 9111 article 918 obligors additional costs the obligor has a right to be compensated by the assignor or the assignee for any additional costs caused by the assignment comment 1 compensation for additional costs the assignment of a right does not necessarily affect the obligors rights and obligations however should the obligor bear additional costs due to the fact that performance has to be rendered to the assignee instead of the original obligee this article entitles the obligor to require due compensation i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 company x is obliged to reimburse a loan of eur 1000000 to company a both companies are located in country m a assigns its right to company b located in country n x has a right to be compensated for the additional costs involved in what has now become an international transfer assignment of rights art 919 313 the rule laid down in this article is in conformity with article 616 which provides a similar solution if a party to the contract changes its place of business after the conclusion of the contract 2 compensation by the assignor or the assignee the obligor may claim compensation for additional costs either from the assignor or from the assignee in the case of a monetary obligation the obligor will often be in a position to set off its right to compensation against the obligation it owes to the assignee 3 partial assignment additional costs may arise in particular in the case of partial assignment see article 914 this article applies accordingly i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 in illustration 2 to article 914 a has assigned to b part of its right to receive a delivery of steel from x instead of having to deliver 1000 tons to a x became obliged to deliver 700 tons to a and 300 tons to b x is entitled to be compensated for the additional costs resulting from having to deliver in two parts 4 obligation becoming significantly more burdensome in two cases compensation for additional costs is not considered to be a sufficient remedy firstly under article 913 the assignment of a right to a nonmonetary performance is not allowed when it would render the obligation significantly more burdensome secondly under article 914 the partial assignment of a right to a nonmonetary performance is also not allowed in similar circumstances article 919 nonassignment clauses 1 the assignment of a right to the payment of a monetary sum is effective notwith standing an agreement between the assignor and the obligor limiting or prohibiting such an assignment however the assignor may be liable to the obligor for breach of contract art 919 unidroit principles 314 2 the assignment of a right to other performance is ineffective if it is contrary to an agreement between the assignor and the obligor limiting or prohibiting the assignment never theless the assignment is effective if the assignee at the time of the assignment neither knew nor ought to have known of the agreement the assignor may then be liable to the obligor for breach of contract comment 1 balance of interests according to article 9172 the consent of the obligor is not required for the assignment to be effective between the assignor and the assignee unless the obligation is of an essentially personal character however in practice it is frequent for the contract between the original obligeeassignor and the obligor to contain a clause limiting or prohibiting the assignment of the original obligeeassignors rights as the obligor may not wish to change obligee should the original obligeeassignor subsequently assign such rights in spite of the non assignment clause the conflicting interests of the obligor and of the assignee must be weighed the obligor suffers a violation of its contractual rights but the assignee must equally be protected at a more general level it is also important to favour the assignment of rights as an efficient means of financing in this respect this article makes a distinction between the assignment of monetary rights and the assignment of rights to other performances 2 monetary rights in the case of the assignment of monetary rights paragraph 1 gives preference to the needs of credit the assignee of a monetary right is protected against nonassignment clauses and the assignment is fully effective however as the assignor acts contrary to its contractual duties it is liable in damages to the obligor for nonperformance of the contract under chapter 7 section 4 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 contractor a is entitled to the payment of usd 100000 from its customer x after a certain stage of construction work has been completed the contract contains a clause prohibiting a from assignment of rights art 919 315 assigning the right a nevertheless assigns the right to bank b b can rely on the assignment despite the clause and can claim payment when it is due x is however entitled to sue a for acting in breach of the clause x could for instance claim damages if it demonstrates that it has suffered some prejudice 2 company x is to reimburse eur 500000 to company a at a date when it can set off this obligation partially with a claim of eur 200000 it has against a the contract between x and a contains a nonassignment clause disregarding that clause a assigns its right to reimbursement to company b x may claim damages against a for the costs it incurs in having to engage in a separate procedure to recover the sum of eur 200000 3 nonmonetary rights the assignment of rights to nonmonetary performances does not have the same relationship to credit thus justifying another solution which is to be found in paragraph 2 in order to achieve a fair balance between the conflicting interests of the three parties concerned the rule is that nonassignment clauses are given effect visvis the assignee with the result that the assignment is ineffective the solution is however reversed if it can be established that at the time of the assignment the assignee did not know and ought not to have known of the nonassignment clause in such a case the assignment is effective but the assignor may be liable in damages to the obligor for non performance of the contract under chapter 7 section 4 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 company x has agreed to communicate to company a all improvements it will develop to a technical process over a period of time their contract stipulates that as rights towards x may not be assigned a does not need the technology for itself any longer and attempts to assign its rights to company b such an assignment is ineffective x does not become bs obligor in such a case b has a claim against a under article 9115b art 9110 unidroit principles 316 article 9110 notice to the obligor 1 until the obligor receives a notice of the assignment from either the assignor or the assignee it is discharged by paying the assignor 2 after the obligor receives such a notice it is discharged only by paying the assignee comment 1 effect of notice on the obligor whereas the assignment is effective between the assignor and the assignee as a result of their agreement see article 917 the obligor will be discharged by paying the assignor until it receives notice of the assignment if the obligor pays the assignor the assignee can recover that payment from the assignor see article 9115f only after the obligor receives a notice of assignment does the assignment become effective towards the obligor the obligor can then be discharged only by paying the assignee i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 seller a assigns its right to payment from buyer x to bank b neither a nor b gives notice to x when payment is due x pays a this payment is fully valid and x is discharged it will be up to b to recover it from a under article 9115f 2 seller a assigns to bank b its right to payment from buyer x b immediately gives notice of the assignment to x when payment is due x still pays a x is not discharged and b is entitled to oblige x to pay a second time before the obligor receives a notice of the assignment it is discharged when it pays the assignor irrespective of whether it knew or ought to have known of the assignment the purpose is to place the burden of informing the obligor of the assignment on the parties to the assignment agreement ie the assignor and the assignee this solution is considered to be justified in the context of international commercial contracts however it does not necessarily exclude that in certain circumstances the obligor will be liable for damages if it acted in bad faith when it paid the assignor assignment of rights art 9110 317 parties sometimes resort to socalled silent assignments where the assignor and the assignee agree not to inform the obligor of the assignment this arrangement is valid between parties but since the obligor receives no notice it will be discharged by paying the assignor as provided in article 91101 2 meaning of notice notice is to be understood in the broad sense of article 110 although this article does not specify the content of the notice the latter should indicate not only the fact of the assignment but also the identity of the assignee the specifications of the right transferred subject to article 916 and in the case of partial assignment the extent of the assignment 3 who should give notice article 91101 leaves the question of who should give notice open ie whether it should be the assignor or the assignee in practice it is probable that in most cases the assignee will take the initiative as it has a major interest in avoiding that the obligor will perform in favour of the assignor notwithstanding the assignment but notice given by the assignor has the same effect when notice is given by the assignee the obligor may request adequate proof of the assignment see article 9112 4 when must notice be given this article does not explicitly require notice to be given only after the assignment agreement has been concluded in some cases the contract between a future assignor and the obligor will provide that the rights arising from it will be assigned to a financial institution whether this can be considered to be adequate notice having the consequences provided for in this article is a matter of interpretation and may possibly depend on the definiteness of the clause regarding the identity of the future assignee 5 revocation of notice notice given to the obligor can be revoked in certain circumstances eg if the assignment agreement itself becomes invalid or if an assignment made for security purposes is no longer necessary this will not affect payments made before the revocation to the person who was the assignee at the time but if the obligor pays that person after the revocation it would no longer be discharged art 9111 unidroit principles 318 article 9111 successive assignments if the same right has been assigned by the same assignor to two or more successive assignees the obligor is discharged by paying according to the order in which the notices were received comment 1 priority of first notice this article deals with the case where the same assignor assigns the same right to different assignees normally this should not happen although in practice it may occur whether the assignor does so consciously or inadvertently preference is then given to the assignee who was the first to give notice the other assignees can only claim against the assignor under article 9115c below i l l u s t r a t i o n on 5 february seller a assigns its right to payment from buyer x to bank b and then on 20 february to bank c c notifies the assignment on 21 february and b does so only on 25 february x is discharged by paying c even though the right was assigned to c after it had been assigned to b unlike the solution prevailing under certain jurisdictions this article does not take into consideration the actual or constructive knowledge the obligor may have of the assignments in the absence of notice this approach is motivated by the wish to encourage the giving of notice thus ensuring a degree of certainty that is especially advisable in the context of international contracts 2 no notice given if no notice is given by any of the successive assignees the obligor will be discharged by paying the assignor see article 91101 3 notice without adequate proof notice by an assignee without there being adequate proof that the assignment has been made may be ineffective under article 9112 assignment of rights art 9112 319 article 9112 adequate proof of assignment 1 if notice of the assignment is given by the assignee the obligor may request the assignee to provide within a reasonable time adequate proof that the assignment has been made 2 until adequate proof is provided the obligor may withhold payment 3 unless adequate proof is provided notice is not effective 4 adequate proof includes but is not limited to any writing emanating from the assignor and indicating that the assignment has taken place comment since receiving the notice of assignment has the important effects provided for in articles 9110 and 9111 this article intends to protect the obligor against the risk of receiving a fraudulent notice from a fake assignee by requiring adequate proof that the assignment has actually been made until adequate proof is provided the obligor may withhold payment to the alleged assignee if adequate proof is provided notice is effective from the date it was provided i l l u s t r a t i o n on 1 december purchaser x has to pay usd 200000 to contractor a as an instalment of the sum due for the construction of a plant in october a assigns the right to bank b either a or b may give notice of the assignment to x if b takes the initiative and writes to x that it has become the assignee of the sum x may require b to provide adequate proof without prejudice to other types of evidence b will probably produce the assignment agreement or any other writing from a confirming that the right has been assigned until such adequate proof is provided x may withhold payment art 9113 unidroit principles 320 article 9113 defences and rights of setoff 1 the obligor may assert against the assignee all defences that the obligor could assert against the assignor 2 the obligor may exercise against the assignee any right of setoff available to the obligor against the assignor up to the time notice of assignment was received comment 1 assertion of defences a right can in principle be assigned without the obligors consent see article 9172 this solution rests on the assumption that the assignment will not adversely affect the obligors legal situation it can happen that the obligor would have been able to withhold or refuse payment to the original obligee on the basis of a defence such as the defective performance of that obligees obligations visvis the obligor to determine whether such defences can be asserted also against the assignee the respective interests of the parties have to be weighed the obligors situation should not deteriorate as a result of the assignment while the assignee has an interest in the integrity of the right it has acquired according to paragraph 1 of this article the obligor may assert against the assignee all the defences that it would have been able to assert if the claim had been made by the assignor in this case however the assignee will have a claim against the assignor under article 9115d i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 software company a promises customer x to install a new accounting application before the end of the year the main payment is to take place one month after completion a immediately assigns the right to bank b when the payment is due b wants to claim it from x but the latter explains that the new software is not working properly and that the accounting department is in chaos x refuses to pay until this catastrophic situation has been remedied x is justified in asserting this defence against b which can then claim against a under article 9115d the same solution applies to defences of a procedural nature assignment of rights art 9114 321 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 company x sells a gas turbine to contractor a to be incorporated into a plant built for customer b when the work has been completed a assigns the guarantee of satisfactory performance to b when the turbine does not work properly b sues x before a court at its place of business x will successfully invoke the arbitration clause included in its contract with a 2 setoff according to paragraph 2 the obligor may exercise against the assignee any right of setoff provided that the right of setoff was available to the obligor under article 81 before the notice of the assignment was given this solution is in accord with the principle that the obligors situation should not deteriorate as a result of the assignment the assignees interests are protected by the claim it may then have against the assignor under article 9115e i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 company a assigns to company b the right to the payment of eur 100000 that it has against company x x however has a claim of eur 60000 against a the two claims have not yet been set off by notice given under article 83 of the principles but the required conditions for setoff were satisfied before the assignment was notified x may still exercise its right of setoff by giving notice to the assignee b can then only claim eur 40000 from x b can recover the difference from a which had undertaken under article 9115e that the obligor would not give notice of setoff as regards the assigned right article 9114 rights related to the right assigned the assignment of a right transfers to the assignee a all the assignors rights to payment or other performance under the contract in respect of the right assigned and b all rights securing performance of the right assigned art 9114 unidroit principles 322 comment 1 scope of the assignment this provision is inspired by the same principle as article 9113 the assignment transfers the assignors right as it is not only with the defences the obligor may be able to assert but also with all the rights to payment or to other performances under the contract in respect of the right assigned and all rights securing performance of the right assigned i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 bank a is entitled to receive reimbursement of a loan of eur 1000000 made to customer x bearing interest at a rate of 3 a assigns its right to reimbursement of the principal to bank b the assignment also operates as a transfer of the right to interest and of the underlying security 2 the initial facts are the same as in illustration 1 but the loan contract entitles a to claim early repayment if x fails to pay the interest due this right is also transferred to b 3 the initial facts are the same as in illustration 1 but x has deposited some shares as security to the benefit of a this benefit is transferred to b subject to the possible application of mandatory requirements of the otherwise applicable law under article 14 2 partial assignment when a right is partially assigned if the rights covered by article 9114 are divisible they will be transferred in proportion if they are not parties should decide whether they are transferred to the assignee or whether they will remain with the assignor 3 contractual deviations the rule laid down in paragraph 1 may however be modified by an agreement between the assignor and the assignee who may stipulate for instance a separate assignment of interest 4 assignors cooperation it follows from the general duty to cooperate laid down in article 513 that the assignor is obliged to take all the steps necessary to permit the assignee to enjoy the benefit of accessory rights and securities assignment of rights art 9115 323 article 9115 undertakings of the assignor the assignor undertakes towards the assignee except as otherwise disclosed to the assignee that a the assigned right exists at the time of the assignment unless the right is a future right b the assignor is entitled to assign the right c the right has not been previously assigned to another assignee and it is free from any right or claim from a third party d the obligor does not have any defences e neither the obligor nor the assignor has given notice of setoff concerning the assigned right and will not give any such notice f the assignor will reimburse the assignee for any payment received from the obligor before notice of the assignment was given comment when assigning a right by agreement to the assignee the assignor assumes several undertakings 1 existence of the right the assigned right should exist at the time of the assignment this would for instance not be the case if the payment had already been made or if the right to a payment had previously been avoided i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 company a assigns a bundle of rights to factor b when required to pay by b customer x demonstrates that the amount due had been paid to a before the assignment b has a claim against a since at the time of the assignment the right no longer existed if as permitted by article 915 a future right is assigned no such undertaking exists art 9115 unidroit principles 324 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 company a assigns to bank b the royalties from a technology licence that is to be granted in the near future to company x the licence never materialises b has no claim against a 2 assignor entitled to assign the right the assignor is entitled to assign the right this is for instance not the case if there is a legal or contractual prohibition to assign the right i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 company x has agreed to communicate to company a all the improvements to a technical process that it will develop over a period of time their contract stipulates that as rights towards x cannot be assigned a no longer needs the technology itself and attempts to assign its rights to company b this illustration was already given above under article 919 to give an example of an ineffective assignment in this case b has a claim against a under article 9115b it will be recalled that the solution would be reversed should b demonstrate that it neither knew nor ought to have known of the nonassignment clause 3 no previous assignment no third party rights or claims if the assignor has already assigned a right to another assignee it is generally not entitled to make a second assignment of that same right and this prohibition could be considered as already covered by the undertaking under subparagraph b the practical importance of this hypothesis is such that a separate and explicit provision is justified it will however be recalled that under article 9111 the second assignee may prevail over the first one if it gives earlier notice to the obligee however a previous assignment may have been made merely for security purposes in this case the right is still assignable with proper disclosure to the second assignee 4 no defence from the obligor according to article 91131 the obligor may assert against the assignee all the defences that the obligor would have been able to assert against the assignor in such a case the assignee has a claim against the assignor on the basis of this undertaking assignment of rights art 9115 325 i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 bank b is the assignee of contractor as right to payment of a certain sum from customer x when payment is due x refuses to pay arguing that a did not perform its obligations properly such defence can be successfully set up against b under article 91131 b would then have a claim against a 5 no notice of setoff the right of setoff may be exercised by the obligor against the assignee if it was available to the obligor before the notice of assign ment was received see article 91132 the assignor undertakes vis vis the assignee that neither the assignor nor the obligor has already given notice of setoff affecting the assigned right the assignor also undertakes that such notice will not be given in the future if for instance the obligor were to give such a notice to the assignee after the assignment as permitted by article 91132 the assignee would have a claim against the assignor under article 9115e 6 reimbursement of payment by the obligor article 91101 provides that until it receives the notice of assignment the obligor is discharged by paying the assignor this is the correct solution to protect the obligor but the assignor and the assignee have agreed between themselves on the transfer of the right the assignor therefore undertakes that it will reimburse the assignee for any payment it received from the obligor before the notice of assignment was given i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 seller a assigns to bank b its right to payment from buyer x neither a nor b gives notice to x when payment is due x pays a as already explained in the comment on article 9110 this payment is fully valid and x is discharged however article 9115f enables b to recover the sum paid from a 7 no undertaking concerning the obligors performance or solvency parties to the assignment may certainly provide for an undertaking by the assignor concerning the obligors present or future solvency or more generally the obligors performance of its obligations however without such an agreement there is no such undertaking under this article art 9115 unidroit principles 326 i l l u s t r a t i o n 6 company b is the assignee of company as right to payment of a certain sum from customer x when payment is due b finds out that x has become insolvent b has to bear the consequences the solution would be the same if b discovered that x was already insolvent at the time of the assignment in case of breach of one of the assignors undertakings the remedies provided for in chapter 7 become available the assignee may for instance claim damages from the assignor or terminate the agreement if the conditions of article 731 et seq are fulfilled 8 effect of disclosure on undertaking some of the assignors undertakings may be affected by disclosures made at the time of the transfer the assignor may for instance advise the assignee of the existence of a claim by a third party in which case the assignee may accept the transfer of the right at its own risk with no undertaking on that matter on the part of the assignor 327 section 2 transfer of obligations article 921 modes of transfer an obligation to pay money or render other performance may be transferred from one person the original obligor to another person the new obligor either a by an agreement between the original obligor and the new obligor subject to article 923 or b by an agreement between the obligee and the new obligor by which the new obligor assumes the obligation comment as is the case with the assignment of rights covered by section 1 of this chapter also the transfer of obligations may serve useful economic purposes for instance if company a can claim payment from its customer b but itself owes a similar amount to its supplier x it may be practical to arrange for the customer to become the suppliers obligor such a transfer of an obligation may occur in two different ways 1 transfer by agreement between the original obligor and the new obligor in practice the more frequent of the two ways indicated in this article to transfer an obligation is by agreement between the original obligor and the new obligor with the obligees consent as required by article 923 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 company a owes its supplier x eur 50000 and customer b owes the same sum to a a and b agree that the latter will take over the formers obligation towards x the obligation is transferred if x agrees to the transaction 2 transfer by agreement between the obligee and the new obligor another possibility is an agreement between the obligee and the new obligor by which the new obligor accepts to take over the obligation art 921 unidroit principles 328 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the products of company x are sold by distributor a on a certain market the contract between the parties is close to termination distributor b enters into negotiations with x proposing to take over the distributorship in order to gain xs acceptance b promises that it will assume a debt of eur 50000 still owed by a to x and x accepts b has become xs obligor 3 obligees consent necessary in both cases the obligee must give its consent to the transfer this is obvious when the transfer occurs by agreement between the obligee and the new obligor if it occurs by an agreement between the original obligor and the new obligor the requirement is stated in article 923 consent may be given in advance under article 924 without the obligees consent the obligor may agree with another person that the latter will perform the obligation under article 926 4 transfer by agreement only only transfers by agreement are governed by this section as opposed to situations where the applicable law may provide for legal transfers such as under certain jurisdictions the automatic transfer of obligations in the case of the merger of companies see article 922 5 obligations in respect of payment of money or other performance this section is not restricted to the transfer of obligations in respect of payment of money it covers also the transfer of obligations relating to other kinds of performance such as the rendering of a service nor are transferable obligations limited to obligations of a contractual nature obligations deriving from tort law or based on a judgment for instance can be governed by this section subject to article 14 6 what is meant by transfer the transfer of an obligation means that it leaves the original obligors assets to enter those of the new obligor however in some cases although the new obligor becomes bound towards the obligee the original obligor is not discharged see article 925 transfer of obligations art 923 329 article 922 exclusion this section does not apply to transfers of obligations made under the special rules governing transfers of obligations in the course of transferring a business comment the articles contained in this section do not apply to transfers of obligations made in the course of transferring a business under any special rules governing such transfers as may happen in the case of the merger of companies the applicable law often provides for mechanisms that cause all rights and obligations to be transferred under certain conditions in their entirety by operation of law article 922 does not prevent this section from applying when certain obligations pertaining to the transferred business are transferred individually i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company a is transferred to company b if the otherwise applicable law provides that all obligations pertaining to the former company are automatically transferred to the latter the principles do not apply 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 but b has reasons to prefer not to become the obligor of company x one of as suppliers a can transfer the obligations concerned to company c with the consent of x this particular transfer is subject to the principles article 923 requirement of obligees consent to transfer the transfer of an obligation by an agreement between the original obligor and the new obligor requires the consent of the obligee art 923 unidroit principles 330 comment 1 agreement between the original and the new obligor as stated in article 921a the transfer of an obligation may occur by an agreement between the original obligor and the person who will become the new obligor 2 obligees consent required this agreement however does not suffice to transfer the obligation it is also necessary for the obligee to give its consent this is different from the corresponding rule on the assignment of rights where the operation is in principle effective without the consent of the obligor see article 917 the assignment of a right does not affect the obligors situation except that the obligor will have to deliver performance to another person on the contrary a change of obligor may considerably affect the obligees position as the new obligor may be less reliable than the original one the change may therefore not be imposed on the obligee who must consent to it i l l u s t r a t i o n company a owes usd 150000 to company x located in asia for services rendered due to a reorganisation of the group as activities in asia are taken over by affiliate company b a and b agree that b will take over as debt towards x the obligation is transferred only if x gives its consent 3 original obligor not necessarily discharged with the obligees consent the new obligor becomes bound by the obligation it does not necessarily follow that the original obligor is discharged see article 925 4 lack of consent by the obligee if the obligee refuses to consent to the transfer or if its consent is not solicited an arrangement for a third party performance is possible under article 926 transfer of obligations art 924 331 article 924 advance consent of obligee 1 the obligee may give its consent in advance 2 if the obligee has given its consent in advance the transfer of the obligation becomes effective when a notice of the transfer is given to the obligee or when the obligee acknowledges it comment 1 advance consent by the obligee paragraph 1 of this article provides that the obligees consent required under article 923 may be given in advance i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 licensor x enters into a transfer of technology agreement with licensee a for a period of ten years a will have to pay royalties to x when the contract is concluded a envisages that at some time in the future it will prefer the royalties to be paid by its affiliate company b x may agree in advance in the contract to the obligation to pay the royalties being transferred by a to b 2 when the transfer is effective as to the obligee according to paragraph 2 if the obligee has given its consent in advance the transfer of the obligation becomes effective when it is notified to the obligee or when the obligee acknowledges it this means that it is sufficient for either the original or the new obligor to notify the obligee of the transfer when it occurs notification is not needed if it appears that the obligee has acknowledged the transfer to which it had given its consent in advance acknowledgement means giving an overt sign of having become aware of the transfer art 925 unidroit principles 332 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 but there comes a time when a actually agrees with b that from then on the latter will take over the obligation to pay the royalties this decision becomes effective when notice is given to x 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 no notice is given but the first time b pays the yearly royalties x writes to b to acknowledge receipt of the payment and to confirm that from then on it will expect b to pay the royalties the transfer is effective with this acknowledgement article 925 discharge of original obligor 1 the obligee may discharge the original obligor 2 the obligee may also retain the original obligor as an obligor in case the new obligor does not perform properly 3 otherwise the original obligor and the new obligor are jointly and severally liable comment 1 extent of original obligors discharge the obligees consent whether given under article 921b or under article 923 has the effect of binding the new obligor to the obligation what still remains to be determined is whether the original obligor is discharged it is primarily up to the obligee to choose among different options only in the case of article 921b will the choice depend also on the original obligor 2 obligees choice full discharge the obligee may first of all fully discharge the original obligor i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 supplier x accepts that its obligor company a transfer its obligation to pay the price to customer b fully confident that the new obligor is solvent and reliable x discharges a should b fail to perform the loss will be on x who will have no recourse against a transfer of obligations art 925 333 3 obligees choice original obligor retained as a subsidiary obligor another possibility is for the obligee to accept the transfer of the obligation from the original obligor to the new obligor on condition that it retain a claim against the original obligor there are two options the first option is that the original obligor is retained as an obligor in the event that the new obligor does not perform properly in this case the obligee must claim performance first from the new obligor but if the new obligor does not perform properly the obligee may call upon the original obligor i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 supplier x accepts that its obligor company a transfer its obligation to pay the price to customer b but this time stipulates that a will remain bound if b does not perform properly x no longer has a direct claim against a and must first request performance from b however should b fail to perform x will have a claim against a 4 obligees choice original obligor and new obligor jointly and severally liable the second option the one most favourable to the obligee is to consider the original obligor and the new obligor jointly and severally liable this means that when performance is due the obligee can exercise its claim against either the original or the new obligor see articles 1113 et seq should the obligee obtain performance from the original obligor the latter would then have a claim against the new obligor see articles 11110 et seq i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 supplier x accepts that its obligor company a transfer its obligation to pay the price to customer b but stipulates that a and b will remain jointly and severally liable in this case x may request performance from either a or b should b perform properly both a and b would be fully discharged should a have to render performance to x it would then have right of recourse against b 5 default rule the language of this article makes it clear that the lastmentioned option is the default rule in other words if the obligee has neither indicated that it intends to discharge the original obligor nor indicated that it intends to keep the original obligor as a subsidiary obligor the original obligor and the new obligor are jointly and severally liable art 926 unidroit principles 334 i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 supplier x accepts that its obligor company a transfer its obligation to pay the price to customer b but says nothing about the liability of a also in this case x may request performance from either a or b should b perform properly both the original and the new obligor would be fully discharged should a have to render performance to x it would then have right of recourse against b 6 original obligor refusing to be discharged when the obligation is assumed by means of an agreement between the obligee and the new obligor as provided in article 921b and the agreement provides that the original obligor is discharged the agree ment amounts to a contract in favour of a third party under article 526 such a benefit cannot be imposed on the beneficiary who may have reasons not to accept it the original obligor may thus refuse to be discharged by the agreement between the obligee and the new obligor if such a refusal occurs the new obligor is bound to the obligee but the original obligor and the new obligor are jointly and severally liable in accordance with the default rule of article 9253 i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the obligation is assumed by an agreement between x and b and that x discharges a if a is no longer interested in a business relationship with b it may accept to be discharged on the other hand if a wants to keep the possibilities it has of benefiting from a renewal of its contract with x it might wish to keep the relationship and may therefore refuse to be discharged article 926 third party performance 1 without the obligees consent the obligor may contract with another person that this person will perform the obligation in place of the obligor unless the obligation in the circumstances has an essentially personal character 2 the obligee retains its claim against the obligor transfer of obligations art 926 335 comment 1 agreement on performance by another party obligations can be transferred either by an agreement between the original obligor and the new obligor with the obligees consent see article 921a or by an agreement between the obligee and the new obligor see article 921b there may be situations in which the consent of the obligee is lacking either because it has not been solicited or because it has been refused in such cases the obligor may agree with another person that this person will perform the obligation in its place when performance becomes due the other person will render it to the obligee while an obligee may refuse to accept a new obligor before performance is due in principle it may not refuse to accept the performance itself when it is offered by another party i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 companies a and b have entered into a cooperation agreement for their activities on a certain market at a certain point they decide to redistribute some of their tasks thus b will take over all operations concerning telecommunications which were previously as responsibility on the following 30 october a would have been bound to pay company x a local operator a sum of usd 100000 the two partners agree that b will pay that amount when it is due on 30 october x may not refuse such a payment made by b 2 obligation of an essentially personal character third party performances may not be refused by the obligee in all the cases in which they would be equally satisfactory as performances rendered by the obligor the situation is different when the performance due is of an essentially personal character linked to the obligors specific qualifications the obligee may then insist on receiving performance by the obligor itself i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 in illustration 1 b also takes over operations for the maintenance of some sophisticated technological equipment developed by a and sold to company y the partners agree that the next yearly maintenance will be carried out by b when bs technicians arrive at ys premises y may refuse their intervention invoking the fact that due to the highly technical nature of the art 927 unidroit principles 336 verifications involved they are entitled to receive performance from the specialised staff of a article 927 defences and rights of setoff 1 the new obligor may assert against the obligee all defences which the original obligor could assert against the obligee 2 the new obligor may not exercise against the obligee any right of setoff available to the original obligor against the obligee comment 1 assertion of defences the obligation transferred to the new obligor is the very same obligation that used to bind the original obligor and in some cases still binds it see article 925 whenever the original obligor would have been able to withhold or refuse payment to the obligee on the basis of a defence such as the defective performance of the obligees own obligations the new obligor may rely on the same defence against the obligee i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 company a owes company x eur 200000 due to be paid at the end of the year as payment for facilities management services with xs consent a transfers this obligation to company b x renders a extremely defective services which would have given a a valid defence for refusing payment when payment is due b may assert the same defence against x 2 defences of a procedural nature the same solution applies to defences of a procedural nature i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that x sues b before a court at its place of business b can successfully invoke the arbitration clause included in the contract between a and x transfer of obligations art 928 337 3 setoff the right of setoff relating to an obligation owed by the obligee to the original obligor may however not be exercised by the new obligor the reciprocity requirement is not fulfilled between the obligee and the new obligor the original obligor may still exercise its right of setoff if it has not been discharged article 928 rights related to the obligation transferred 1 the obligee may assert against the new obligor all its rights to payment or other performance under the contract in respect of the obligation transferred 2 if the original obligor is discharged under article 9251 a security granted by any person other than the new obligor for the performance of the obligation is discharged unless that other person agrees that it should continue to be available to the obligee 3 discharge of the original obligor also extends to any security of the original obligor given to the obligee for the performance of the obligation unless the security is over an asset which is transferred as part of a transaction between the original obligor and the new obligor comment 1 scope of the transfer the rules laid down in this article are inspired by the same principle as article 927 the obligation is transferred to the new obligor as it is not only with the defences the original obligor was able to assert but also with all the rights to payment or to other performances under the contract that the obligee had in respect of the obligation transferred the following illustrations provide examples of such rights art 928 unidroit principles 338 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company a must reimburse bank x for a loan of eur 1000000 bearing an interest rate of 3 a transfers its obligation to reimburse the principal to company b the transfer also includes the obligation to pay the 3 interest 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the loan contract entitles x to claim premature reimbursement if a fails to pay the interest due x can assert also this right against b 2 contractual deviations party autonomy permits deviations from the rules laid down in this article such as a separate transfer of the obligation to pay interest 3 securities in assignment of rights and transfer of obligations compared in the case of the assignment of a right all rights securing performance are automatically transferred to the assignee see article 9114b this solution is justified by the fact that the assignment of a right does not alter the obligors situation ie securities can continue to serve their purposes in unchanged circumstances the transfer of an obligation to a new obligor on the contrary modifies the context in which the security has been granted if the original obligor is discharged and if the security were to be transferred with the obligation the risk of breach or insolvency to be covered would be that of another person thus completely altering the object of the security 4 suretyship if the original obligors obligation was covered by a suretyship granted by another person this suretyship can survive if the original obligor remains bound if on the other hand the original obligor is discharged the suretyship cannot be transferred to cover the new obligor unless the person who granted the suretyship agrees that it should continue to be available to the obligee i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 company a owes usd 1000000 to company x bank s has agreed to guarantee due performance of this obligation with xs agreement a transfers the obligation to company b and x accepts to discharge a s does not guarantee bs obligation unless it agrees to continue to provide the security transfer of obligations art 928 339 a special case occurs when the suretyship was granted by the person who was itself to become the new obligor in such a case the security necessarily disappears since a person cannot provide a security for its own obligation 5 securities over assets the original obligor may have given one of its assets as security in this case if the obligation is transferred and the original obligor is discharged the security ceases to cover the obligation now binding the new obligor i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 bank x has granted a loan of eur 100000 to company a secured by a deposit of shares by the obligor with xs agreement a transfers the obligation to pay back the loan to company b and x accepts to discharge a the shares cease to serve as security the solution is different if the asset given as security is transferred as part of a transaction between the original and the new obligor i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 4 but the transfer of the obligation between a and b occurs as part of a broader operation in which ownership of the shares is also transferred to b in such a situation the shares will continue to serve as security for bs obligation to reimburse the loan 340 section 3 assignment of contracts article 931 definitions assignment of a contract means the transfer by agreement from one person the assignor to another person the assignee of the assignors rights and obligations arising out of a contract with another person the other party comment rights and obligations can be transferred separately under the respective rules of sections 1 and 2 of this chapter in some cases however a contract is assigned as a whole more precisely a person transfers to another person all the rights and obligations deriving from its being a party to a contract a contractor for instance may wish to let another contractor replace it as one of the parties in a construction contract the articles of this section cover the assignment of contracts as defined in this article only transfers by agreement are concerned as opposed to various situations where the applicable law may provide for legal transfers such as under certain jurisdictions the automatic transfer of contracts in the case of the merger of companies see article 932 article 932 exclusion this section does not apply to the assign ment of contracts made under the special rules governing transfers of contracts in the course of transferring a business comment the assignment of contracts may be subject to special rules of the applicable law when it is made in the course of the transfer of a assignment of contracts art 933 341 business such special rules often provide for mechanisms that cause all contracts of the business to be transferred under certain conditions by operation of law this article does not prevent the present section from applying when certain contracts pertaining to the transferred business are assigned individually i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company a is transferred to company b if the otherwise applicable law provides that all contracts to which the former company was a party are automatically transferred to the latter the principles do not apply 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 but b is not interested in taking over a particular contract with company x and prefers that contract to be assigned to company c this particular transfer is subject to the principles article 933 requirement of consent of the other party the assignment of a contract requires the consent of the other party comment 1 agreement between assignor and assignee the first requirement for the assignment of a contract is that the assignor and the assignee agree on the operation 2 other partys consent required this agreement does not however suffice to transfer the contract it is also necessary for the other party to give its consent if it were only for the assignment of the rights involved such a consent would in principle not be needed see article 917 however the assignment of a contract also involves a transfer of obligations which cannot be effective without the obligees consent see article 923 the assignment of a contract can thus only occur with the other partys consent art 934 unidroit principles 342 i l l u s t r a t i o n office space is let by owner x to company a the contract expires only six years from the date of the contract due to the development of its business a wants to move to larger premises company b would be interested in taking over the lease the contract can be assigned by an agreement between a and b but the operation also requires xs consent 3 assignor not necessarily discharged of its obligations with the other partys consent the assignee becomes bound by the assignors obligations under the assigned contract it does not necessarily follow that the assignor is discharged see article 935 article 934 advance consent of the other party 1 the other party may give its consent in advance 2 if the other party has given its consent in advance the assignment of the contract becomes effective when a notice of the assignment is given to the other party or when the other party acknowledges it comment 1 advance consent by the other party paragraph 1 of this article provides that the other partys consent required under article 933 may be given in advance this rule concerning the assignment of contracts corresponds to the rule in article 924 according to which the obligee who must consent to the transfer of the obligation may give its consent in advance similarly the other party who must consent to the assignment of the contract may also give its consent in advance i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 company x enters into an agreement with agency a providing that the latter will be responsible for advertising xs products in country m for the next five years a however is already assignment of contracts art 935 343 considering ceasing its activities in country m in the not too distant future and obtains xs advance consent to the subsequent assignment of the contract to agency b located in country ms capital this advance consent is effective under article 934 2 when the assignment of the contract is effective visvis the other party according to paragraph 2 if the other party has given its consent in advance the assignment of the contract becomes effective when it is notified to the other party or when the other party acknowledges it this means that it is sufficient for either the assignor or the assignee to notify the assignment when it occurs notification is not needed if it appears that the obligee has acknowledged the transfer to which it had given its consent in advance acknowledgement means giving an overt sign of having become aware of the transfer i l l u s t r a t i o n s 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 when a actually assigns its contract to b the assignment becomes effective visvis the other party when either a or b notifies it to x 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 no notice is given but b sends x a proposal for a new advertising campaign x understands that the assignment has taken place and sends its comments on the proposal to b the assignment of the contract is effective with this acknowledgement article 935 discharge of the assignor 1 the other party may discharge the assignor 2 the other party may also retain the assignor as an obligor in case the assignee does not perform properly 3 otherwise the assignor and the assignee are jointly and severally liable art 935 unidroit principles 344 comment 1 extent of assignors discharge this article concerning the assignment of contracts corresponds to article 925 to the extent that the assignment of a contract causes obligations to be transferred from the assignor to the assignee the other party as an obligee may decide the effect that the acceptance of the assignee as a new obligor will have on the assignors obligations this article gives the other party several choices and provides for a default rule 2 other partys choice full discharge the other party may first of all fully discharge the assignor i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 by contract with company x company a has undertaken to dispose of the waste produced by an industrial process at a certain point x accepts that the contract is assigned by a to company b fully confident that b is solvent and reliable x discharges a should b fail to perform properly x will have no recourse against a 3 other partys choice assignor retained as a subsidiary obligor another possibility is for the other party to accept the assignment of the contract on condition that it retain a claim against the assignor there are two options the first option is that the assignor is retained as an obligor in the event that the assignee does not perform properly in this case the other party must necessarily claim performance first from the assignee but if the assignee does not perform properly the other party may call upon the assignor i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that x when consenting to the assignment has stipulated that a will remain bound if b does not perform properly x no longer has a direct claim against a and must first request performance from b however should b fail to perform then x would have a claim against a assignment of contracts art 935 345 4 other partys choice assignor retained as jointly and severally liable with the assignee the second option the one most favourable to the other party is to consider the assignor and the assignee jointly and severally liable this means that when performance is due the other party can exercise its claim against either the assignor or the assignee see articles 1113 et seq should the other party obtain performance from the assignor the latter would then have a claim against the assignee see articles 11110 et seq i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 company x accepts that company a assign the contract to company b but stipulates that a and b will remain jointly and severally liable in this case x may require performance from either a or b should b perform properly both a and b would be fully discharged should a have to render performance to x it would then have a right of recourse against b 5 default rule the language of this article makes it clear that the lastmentioned option is the default rule in other words if the other party has neither indicated that it intends to discharge the assignor nor indicated that it intends to keep the assignor as a subsidiary obligor the assignor and the assignee are jointly and severally liable i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 company x accepts that company a assign the contract to company b but says nothing about the liability of a also in this case x may request performance from either a or b should b perform properly both a and b would be fully discharged should a have to render performance to x it would then have a right of recourse against b 6 differentiated options possible a party to a contract is often subject to a whole set of obligations when the contract is assigned the other party may choose to exercise different options with regard to the different obligations the other party may for instance accept to discharge the assignor for a certain obligation but to retain it either as a subsidiary obligor or to consider it jointly and severally liable with the assignee with respect to other obligations art 936 unidroit principles 346 i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 company a has entered into a knowhow licence contract with company x in return for the transferred technology a has undertaken to pay royalties and to cooperate with x in the development of a new product when x later on accepts that a assign the contract to company b x discharges a from the obligation to participate in the joint research for which it will deal with the assignee only but retains a as a subsidiary or a jointly and severally liable with b for the payment of royalties article 936 defences and rights of setoff 1 to the extent that the assignment of a contract involves an assignment of rights article 9113 applies accordingly 2 to the extent that the assignment of a contract involves a transfer of obligations article 927 applies accordingly comment the assignment of a contract entails both an assignment of the original rights and a transfer of the original obligations from the assignor to the assignee the transaction should not adversely affect the other partys situation as an obligor and it should put the assignee in the same situation as the assignor in its capacity as obligor as a consequence the provisions concerning defences in sections 1 and 2 of this chapter apply accordingly when the assignee exercises its rights the other party may assert all the defences it could have asserted as obligor if the claim had been made by the assignor see article 9113 when the other party exercises its rights the assignee may assert all the defences that the assignor could have asserted as obligor if the claim had been made against it see article 927 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 company x has outsourced its risk management department to consultant a with xs consent the contract is assigned to consultant b due to as incompetence x was not properly insured for a loss it subsequently suffered pending indemnification x may suspend paying b the agreed fees assignment of contracts art 937 347 2 airline a has a contract with catering company x a transfers the operation of its flights to certain destinations to airline b with xs consent the catering contract is assigned by a to b litigation later arises and x sues b before a court at its place of business as a procedural defence b may successfully invoke that the assigned contract includes an arbitration clause article 937 rights transferred with the contract 1 to the extent that the assignment of a contract involves an assignment of rights article 9114 applies accordingly 2 to the extent that the assignment of a contract involves a transfer of obligations article 928 applies accordingly comment the assignment of a contract entails both an assignment of the original rights and a transfer of the original obligations from the assignor to the assignee in parallel to what has been said about defences under article 936 the operation should not adversely affect the other partys situation as an obligee and it should place the assignee in the same situation as the assignor in its capacity as obligee as a consequence the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of this chapter concerning rights related to the claim assigned and to the obligation transferred will apply accordingly when the assignee acts against the other party it may assert all the rights to payment or other performances under the contract assigned with respect to the rights assigned as well as all rights securing such performance see article 9114 when the other party exercises its rights it may assert all its rights to payment or other performances under the contract with respect to the obligation transferred against the assignee see article 9281 securities granted for the performance of the assignors obligations are maintained or discharged in accordance with article 9282 and 3 art 937 unidroit principles 348 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a service contract provides that late payment of the yearly fees due by customer x to supplier a will bear interest at the rate of 10 with xs consent a assigns the contract to supplier b when x fails to pay the yearly fees on time b is entitled to claim such interest see article 9114a 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 but x has also provided a with a bank guarantee covering payment of the fees b may call upon that guarantee should x fail to pay the fees see article 9114b 3 company x has ordered the construction and installation of industrial equipment from company a performance levels have been agreed between the parties and the contract provides for liquidated damages should actual performance be insufficient with xs consent a assigns the contract to company b the assignee delivers equipment that does not meet the required performance levels x may avail itself of the liquidated damages against b see article 9281 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 but a has provided x with a bank guarantee covering satisfactory performance the bank guarantee will not apply to bs obligations resulting from the assignment unless the bank accepts to continue to offer its guarantee in respect of the assignees obligations see article 9282 349 chapter 10 limitation periods article 101 scope of the chapter 1 the exercise of rights governed by the principles is barred by the expiration of a period of time referred to as limitation period according to the rules of this chapter 2 this chapter does not govern the time within which one party is required under the principles as a condition for the acquisition or exercise of its right to give notice to the other party or to perform any act other than the institution of legal proceedings comment 1 notion of limitation period all legal systems recognise the influence of passage of time on rights there are two basic systems under one system the passage of time extinguishes rights and actions under the other system the passage of time operates only as a defence against an action in court under the principles a lapse of time does not extinguish rights but operates only as a defence see article 109 this article refers in general to rights governed by the principles to indicate that not only the right to require performance or the right to another remedy for nonperformance can be barred but also the exercise of rights which directly affect a contract such as the right of termination or a right of price reduction contractually agreed upon art 101 unidroit principles 350 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a sells a tanker to b upon delivery the ship turns out not to be in conformity with the specifications contained in the contract but it is only three and a half years later that b brings an action against a for the cure of the defects a may raise the defence of bs claim being timebarred under article 102 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the contract between a and b contains a clause allowing b a price reduction of up to 30 in case of missing equipment or spare parts bs right to a price reduction is also barred 2 notice requirements and other prerequisites for enforcing rights under the principles rights can be lost if the party entitled to acquire or exercise a right fails to give notice or to perform an act within a reasonable period of time without undue delay or within another fixed period of time see articles 211 2122 communications in the context of formation of contracts article 3212 notice of avoidance of the contract article 623 request for renegotiation article 722e request for performance article 7322 notice of termination of the contract although they serve a function similar to limitation periods these special timelimits and their effects are not affected by the limitation periods provided for in this chapter as they are designed to meet special needs as they are generally much shorter than the limitation periods provided for in this chapter they take effect regardless of the latter in the exceptional case that in the circumstances a reasonable period of time is longer than the applicable limitation period the former will prevail i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b sets a an additional period of time of 60 days for the cure of the defects a fails to cure the defects but it is only two months after the expiry of the additional period fixed that b sends a a notice of termination under article 732 although bs claim is not timebarred under article 102 it has lost the right to terminate the contract because it has not given notice of termination within a reasonable time as required by article 7322 limitation periods art 102 351 3 mandatory rules of domestic law in cases in which the parties reference to the principles is considered to be only an agreement to incorporate them in the contract mandatory rules on limitation periods of national international or supranational origin relating to the length suspension and renewal of the limitation periods as well as to the right of the parties to modify them prevail over the rules laid down in this chapter see comment 2 on article 14 yet even in cases in which the principles are applied as the law governing the contract domestic mandatory rules on limitation periods prevail over the rules laid down in this chapter provided that they claim application whatever the law governing the contract see comment 3 on article 14 i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 seller a in country x sells and delivers component parts to car manufacturer b in country y some of the parts are defective and the same year of delivery the defects cause accidents for which b has to pay damages four years later b asks a to be indemnified for its costs a refuses to pay the contract provides for arbitration in country z with the unidroit principles as the applicable law in an arbitration commenced by b a raises the defence of the expiration of the threeyear limitation period provided for in article 102 b responds that under the law of country x the claim for damages for defective goods is timebarred only after 5 years and that this rule claims to apply irrespective of the law governing the contract the rule of the law of country x prevails article 102 limitation periods 1 the general limitation period is three years beginning on the day after the day the obligee knows or ought to know the facts as a result of which the obligees right can be exercised 2 in any event the maximum limitation period is ten years beginning on the day after the day the right can be exercised art 102 unidroit principles 352 comment 1 no common solution although periods of limitation of rights and claims are common to all legal systems they differ in length they range from six months or one year for claims for breach of warranties to up to 15 20 or even 30 years for other claims at international level the 1974 united nations convention on the limitation period in the international sale of goods as amended in 1980 un limitation convention provides uniform rules but is restricted to the international sale of goods 2 relevant factors the stated length of a limitation period does not always in itself determine the time after which the exercise of rights is barred that time may be affected by the prerequisites for the starting of the period and by circumstances affecting its running see articles 104 to 109 it may also be affected by the agreement of the parties see article 103 party autonomy with regard to limitation periods is of great practical importance as periods that are either too long or too short may be tolerable if the parties may modify them freely according to their needs 3 balance between interests of obligee and obligor the principles strike a balance between the conflicting interests of the obligee and the obligor of a dormant claim an obligee should have a reasonable chance to pursue its right and should therefore not be prevented from pursuing its right by the lapse of time before the right becomes due and can be enforced furthermore the obligee should know or at least have a chance to know its right and the identity of the obligor on the other hand the obligee should be able to close its files after some time regardless of the obligors knowledge and consequently a maximum period should be established contrary to the un limitation convention which has only one absolute limitation period of four years which begins on the date of accrual of the claim see articles 8 and 91 the principles provide for a twotier system 4 basic structure of the limitation regime the twotier system adopts the policy that the obligee should not be barred before it has had a real possibility to pursue its right as a result of having actual or constructive knowledge of the right paragraph 1 limitation periods art 102 353 therefore provides for a rather short threeyear limitation period starting the day after the obligee knows or ought to know the facts on which its right is based and this right can be exercised paragraph 2 provides for a tenyear maximum limitation period commencing at the time when the right can be exercised regardless of the obligees actual or constructive knowledge 5 right can be exercised the obligee has a real possibility to exercise its right only if it has become due and can be enforced paragraph 2 therefore provides that the maximum limitation period starts only at such date 6 knowledge of the facts as distinguished from knowledge of the law the general threeyear limitation period starts the day after the day the obligee knows or ought to know the facts as a result of which the obligees right can be exercised facts within the meaning of this provision are the facts on which the right is based such as the formation of a contract the delivery of goods the undertaking of services and nonperformance the facts indicating that a right or claim has fallen due must be known or at least knowable by the obligee before the general limitation period starts the identity of the obligor may also be in doubt eg in cases of agency the transfer of debts or entire contracts the windingup of companies or unclear thirdparty beneficiary contracts in these cases the obligee must know or have reason to know whom to sue before it can be blamed for not having pursued the right or claim actual or constructive knowledge of facts however does not mean that the obligee must know the legal implications of the facts if despite full knowledge of the facts the obligee is mistaken about its rights the threeyear limitation period may nevertheless start to run i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a designs and builds a bridge under a contract with county b as engineers make a mistake in calculating the strength of some steel girders four years later the bridge collapses due to a combination of the weight of some heavy trucks and a storm bs claims for damages are not barred because the general limitation period started only at the time of the collapse when b was in a position to discover as breach 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the bridge collapses eleven years after its construction bs claims are barred under the maximum limitation period under article 1022 parties art 102 unidroit principles 354 to such a contract are well advised to adjust the maximum period while remaining within the limits of article 103 3 a sends b a notice under article 732 terminating a sales contract between a and b because b refuses to take delivery of goods tendered by a thirtyseven months after receipt of the note of termination b demands the return of an advance on the purchase price paid prior to the termination asserting that due to an error in its bookkeeping it had overlooked its payment of the advance with the consequence that it had only recently become aware of the claim for restitution it had under article 7361 bs claim for restitution is barred by the threeyear limitation period as b ought to have known of its payment when the contract was terminated and the claim to repay the advance arose 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b asserts that it had not realised the legal effects of a notice of termination bs claim for restitution is nevertheless barred an error of law with regard to the legal effects of a notice of termination cannot absolve the obligee since ought to know includes seeking legal advice if the party is uncertain about the legal effects of the circumstances 7 day of commencement since in the absence of an agreement to the contrary the obligor can normally perform its obligation in the course of the whole day of the debts maturity the limitation period does not start on that same day but only on the following day i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a is obliged to pay a sum of money on 24 november if a does not pay by that date the limitation period starts on 25 november 8 right must be exercisable an obligation may exist even if performance cannot as yet be required see eg article 611a while a creditors claim to the repayment of a loan is founded on the contract and may therefore arise at the time of the conclusion of the contract or of the payment of the loan to the debtor the repayment claim will usually fall due much later furthermore a right may not be enforceable if the obligor has a defence limitation periods art 102 355 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 6 a loan agreement obliges the borrower to repay the loan on 15 november the lender grants the borrower an extension of the date of repayment until 15 december the limitation period starts on 16 december 7 a contracts to build a fertiliser plant for b the price is to be paid in three instalments the last instalment being due four weeks after completion of the work as certified by an engineering firm after certification there are still malfunctionings of the plant b is entitled to withhold performance of the last instalment under articles 7132 and 7144 the limitation period for the claim for payment does not begin until the right to withhold payment is extinguished by cure of the malfunctionings 9 maximum period under paragraph 2 the obligee is in any event ie irrespective of whether it knew or ought to have known the facts giving rise to its right prevented from exercising the right ten years after it could have exercised it the objectives of this maximum period of ten years are the restoration of peace and the prevention of speculative litigation where evidence has faded i l l u s t r a t i o n 8 b borrows money from a and orders its accountant to repay the loan when repayment falls due in january fifteen years later a dispute arises over whether the loan was repaid fully or only in part as a claims as asserted claim is barred by article 1022 because the maximum limitation period has expired 10 ancillary claims this article applies to all rights including socalled ancillary claims i l l u s t r a t i o n s 9 in a loan agreement the borrower agrees to pay an interest of 07 per month if there is default in repayment thirtyfive months after repayment is due the borrower repays the principal the lender need not sue for all successive monthly instalments of interest at once but can wait up to thirtysix months for each instalment before it is barred art 103 unidroit principles 356 10 under the contract of builder a with owner b a agrees to complete construction by 1 october and to pay eur 50000 for every month of delay up to a maximum amount of eur 2500000 completion is delayed for 40 months claims for damages for non performance or delay are barred 36 months after 2 october the claim for the penalty for each month of delay is barred 36 months after it arises 11 year this article does not provide a definition of year because at international level a reference to year is usually understood as being a reference to the gregorian calendar see article 13h of the un limitation convention in any event calendars deviating from the gregorian calendar will in most cases have the same number of days per year with the consequence that they do not influence the length of limitation periods a different meaning of year can be agreed upon by the parties under article 15 such an agreement may be explicit or derived from an interpretation of the contract article 103 modification of limitation periods by the parties 1 the parties may modify the limitation periods 2 however they may not a shorten the general limitation period to less than one year b shorten the maximum limitation period to less than four years c extend the maximum limitation period to more than fifteen years comment 1 basic decision modifications possible in some legal systems the power of the parties to modify limitation periods and their effects is restricted out of concern for the weaker parties and in particular consumers a distinction is sometimes made between very short limitation periods which can be prolonged and other limitation periods which cannot be modified or can only be limitation periods art 103 357 shortened since the principles apply to international contracts between businesspersons who are normally experienced and knowledgeable persons who do not need to be protected they permit the parties to adapt the limitation periods applicable to the rights arising out of their contracts to their needs in a given case restrictions to the parties autonomy in this respect may however follow from the mandatory rules of the otherwise applicable law see article 14 2 limits of modifications the possibility nevertheless remains that a party with superior bargaining power or better information may take advantage of the other party by either unduly shortening or lengthening the limitation period this article therefore limits the power to shorten the general limitation period by stating that it may not be shortened to less than one year starting from the moment of actual or constructive knowledge and to shorten the maximum period by stating that it may not be shortened to less than four years the maximum limitation period and necessarily the general period cannot exceed fifteen years i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 to article 102 except that in their contract the parties provide that the maximum limitation period for all claims based on hidden defects is fifteen years bs claim for damages is not yet barred 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 to article 102 except that in their contract the parties provide that the maximum limitation period for all claims based on hidden defects is twentyfive years and the bridge collapsed after sixteen years bs claim for damages is barred because the maximum limitation period can be extended to only fifteen years 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 to article 102 except that in their contract the parties provide that the general limitation period in case of harm resulting from the nonconformity of the bridge starts only upon the submission of a written report of experts of an independent engineering firm after the collapse of the bridge it is uncertain what the causes were and it takes two years for the engineering firm to submit its report the general limitation period begins to run only from the day after the day on which the report was submitted art 104 unidroit principles 358 3 time of modification a modification can be agreed upon before or after the commence ment of a limitation period a modification agreed upon before or after the commencement of a limitation period differs from an agreement concluded after the limitation period has expired such an agreement although too late to modify the applicable limitation period may have legal consequences either as a waiver of the defence that the limitation period has expired or as a new promise by the obligor article 104 new limitation period by acknowledgement 1 where the obligor before the expiration of the general limitation period acknowledges the right of the obligee a new general limitation period begins on the day after the day of the acknowledgement 2 the maximum limitation period does not begin to run again but may be exceeded by the beginning of a new general limitation period under article 1021 comment 1 acknowledgement of rights most legal systems permit the running of the limitation period to be altered by acts of the parties or other circumstances sometimes acts of the parties or other circumstances interrupt the running of the limitation period with the effect that a new limitation period starts sometimes acts or other circumstances cause a suspension of the running of the limitation period with the effect that the period of suspension is not counted in computing the limitation period according to this article the acknowledgement of a right by the obligor causes an interruption of the limitation period see also article 20 of the un limitation convention limitation periods art 104 359 2 commencement of a new general limitation period the new limitation period that starts following acknowledgement of the right of the obligee is the general limitation period because by virtue of such an acknowledgement the obligee will necessarily possess the knowledge required for commencement of the limitation period under article 1021 there is therefore no need to protect the obligee by granting it a new maximum limitation period i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a defectively performs a construction contract with b and b informs a of the nonconformities in october without receiving any response from a two years later b again approaches a threatening to bring an action for damages this time a responds and acknowledges the nonconformity of its performance and promises to cure the nonconformity on the following day a new general limitation period starts to run for bs right to damages the commencement of a new general limitation period following acknowledgement can take place either during the general limitation period under article 1021 or during the maximum limitation period under article 1022 while the maximum limitation period will not in itself begin again the new general limitation period may exceed the maximum period by up to three years if the obligor acknowledges the right of the obligee after more than seven years but before the maximum period has already expired i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 b discovers defects in the construction work of a only nine years after completion of the work the defects could not have been discovered earlier b threatens to initiate legal action and a acknowledges the defects a new general limitation period begins to run on acknowledgement so that altogether the limitation period amounts to twelve years 3 novation and other acts creating a new obligation acknowledgement does not create a new obligation it merely interrupts the running of the limitation period accessory rights are therefore not extinguished consequently if the limitation period has already ended a mere acknowledgement under this article does not retroactively remove or invalidate the limitation defence art 104 unidroit principles 360 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 except that b knows or ought to know of as defective construction at the time of completion b approaches a only 7 years later and a acknowledges the defective performance bs claim is nevertheless already barred under article 1021 and is not revived by as acknowledgement if the parties want to undo the effects of a completed limitation period they can create a new obligation by a novation or an unilateral act on the part of the obligor or the obligor can waive the defence of the expiration of a limitation period the parties can also prolong the duration of the obligees right beyond the end of the maximum limitation period under article 1022 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 except that a in order to maintain a profitable business relation not only acknow ledges the defective performance but promises to cure the defects regardless of any question of as liability this agreement creates a new obligation for a which is barred only three years later 5 nine years after completion b discovers defects in as construction work which could not have been discovered earlier on notice to a a responds that it will investigate the causes of the defects and will therefore not invoke the limitation period until six months after the experts investigating the defects submit their report the report is submitted twelve months later confirming bs notice of defects when b asks a to cure the defects a argues that the maximum period of article 1022 has expired with the consequence that no claim for damages can be made by b as argument is incorrect if b abstained from initiating judicial proceedings on account of as waiver 4 interruption of limitation periods modified by the parties to the extent that the parties have modified the general limitation period under article 1021 acknowledgement and the commencement of a new limitation period affect the general period as modified if for example the parties have shortened the general limitation period to one year acknowledgement causes a new oneyear period to run limitation periods art 105 361 i l l u s t r a t i o n 6 a and b have agreed to shorten the limitation period for claims arising from the nonconformity of as performance to two years after nine and a half years b discovers defects in as performance and a acknowledges its obligation to cure b has another two years to pursue its claim before it is barred under article 1021 since the obligor can acknowledge more than once the limited effect of an acknowledgement that causes only the general limitation period to start again can be overcome by a subsequent acknowledgement i l l u s t r a t i o n 7 a delivers nonconforming goods to b in november b suffers loss resulting from the nonconformity because its customers complain and return the goods since two years later the total amount of loss is not yet clear b pressures a to acknowledge its liability and in december of that year a complies with bs request two years later there are still uncertainties regarding the exact extent of bs obligations towards its customers some of whom have sued for compensation for consequential damages allegedly caused by the goods b therefore turns to a again who acknowledges its obligation to compensate b should the claims of bs customers be wellfounded b has three more years before its claims against a are barred article 105 suspension by judicial proceedings 1 the running of the limitation period is suspended a when the obligee performs any act by commencing judicial proceedings or in judicial proceedings already instituted that is recognised by the law of the court as asserting the obligees right against the obligor b in the case of the obligors insolvency when the obligee has asserted its rights in the insolvency proceedings or c in the case of proceedings for disso lution of the entity which is the obligor when the obligee has asserted its rights in the dissolution proceedings art 105 unidroit principles 362 2 suspension lasts until a final decision has been issued or until the proceedings have been otherwise terminated comment 1 judicial proceedings in all legal systems judicial proceedings affect the running of a limitation period in either of two manners judicial proceedings can cause an interruption of the limitation period so that a new limitation period begins when the judicial proceedings end alternatively judicial proceedings can cause only a suspension so that a period that has already lapsed before the judicial proceedings began will be deducted from the applicable period the remaining period starting at the end of the judicial procedure this article adopts the latter solution see also article 13 of the un limitation convention 2 commencement of proceedings the requirements for the commencement of judicial proceedings are determined by the law of procedure of the court where the proceedings are instituted the law of procedure of the forum also determines whether the raising of counterclaims amounts to the instituting of judicial proceedings in regard to these claims where the counterclaims raised as a defence are treated as if they were brought in separate proceedings raising them has the same effect on the limitation period as if they had been filed independently i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 a purchases from b a truck that turns out to be defective a notifies b of the defects but because of other pending contracts between a and b a does not press the matter for 24 months when the negotiations between a and b on the other contracts break down b turns down a request by a to cure the defects asserting that the defects were caused by as mishandling of the truck a files a law suit against b by depositing it with the clerk of the competent court under the procedural law applicable in that court this is sufficient to initiate litigation with respect to as claims the running of the limitation period is suspended until a final decision is handed down this includes not only a decision of the court of first instance but also if appeal is allowed that of a higher court on any available appeal if the parties reach a settlement or the plaintiff withdraws limitation periods art 106 363 its complaint this ends the litigation if it is so regarded under the applicable domestic procedural law 2 b initiates litigation for the purchase price of goods by filing a complaint as required by the procedural law of the country of the competent court a raises claims under an asserted guarantee either as counterclaims or by way of setoff the limitation period for as warranty claims is suspended until there is a final decision on the counterclaims or a settlement or withdrawal of as counterclaims 3 termination termination by a final decision or otherwise is to be determined by the rules of procedure of the forum these rules decide when a decision is final and therefore brings the litigation on the litigated subjectmatter to an end these rules also have to decide whether and when the litigation comes to an end without a final decision on the merits eg by the withdrawal of a complaint or by a settlement of the parties 4 suspension by insolvency or dissolution proceedings for the purpose of this article insolvency and dissolution proceedings are regarded as judicial proceedings article 1051b and c the dates of the commencement and ending of these proceedings are determined by the law governing the proceedings article 106 suspension by arbitral proceedings 1 the running of the limitation period is suspended when the obligee performs any act by commencing arbitral proceedings or in arbitral proceedings already instituted that is recognised by the law of the arbitral tribunal as asserting the obligees right against the obligor in the absence of regulations for arbitral proceedings or provisions determining the exact date of the commencement of arbitral proceedings the proceedings are deemed to commence on the date on which a request that the right in dispute should be adjudicated reaches the obligor art 106 unidroit principles 364 2 suspension lasts until a binding decision has been issued or until the proceedings have been otherwise terminated comment 1 arbitral proceedings arbitration has the same effect as judicial proceedings the commencement of arbitral proceedings therefore has the same suspensive effect as judicial proceedings in general the date of commencement is determined by the applicable arbitration rules and the starting point of suspension is also determined by these rules for cases in which the rules on arbitration do not exactly determine the date of commencement of the proceedings the second sentence of paragraph 1 of this article provides a default rule i l l u s t r a t i o n a cancels a distributorship contract with b claiming that b has defaulted payments due for as delivery of goods to b b counterclaims damages for lost profits but b changes its law firm and allows almost 30 months to pass from the termination of the agreement the agreement contains an arbitration clause providing that all disputes and claims shall be settled under the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce and b submits a request for arbitration under those rules the rules provide that the date of receipt of the request is to be regarded for all purposes as the date of the commencement of the arbitral proceedings the running of the limitation period is suspended until a final award is handed down or the case is otherwise disposed of 2 termination of arbitration while the most frequent cases of termination will as in judicial proceedings be those that end with a decision on the merits of the case arbitration can also end otherwise eg by the withdrawal of an application by a settlement or by an order or injunction of the competent court the applicable rules on arbitration and civil procedure have to determine whether or not such events terminate the arbitration and thereby also the suspension limitation periods art 107 365 article 107 alternative dispute resolution the provisions of articles 105 and 106 apply with appropriate modifications to other proceedings whereby the parties request a third person to assist them in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute comment 1 alternative dispute resolution before resorting to judicial proceedings or arbitration parties may start negotiations or agree on conciliation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution under the principles negotiations do not automatically suspend the limitation period parties who want the limitation period to be suspended should come to an express agreement to this effect by contrast this article provides that conciliation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution cause a suspension of the limitation period the definition of alternative dispute resolution as proceedings whereby the parties request a third person to assist them in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute is inspired by article 13 of the 2002 uncitral model law on international commercial conciliation 2 absence of statutory regulations as only few countries have enacted statutes on alternative dispute resolution and rules for such proceedings are relatively rare this article refers to the provisions on judicial and arbitral proceedings which have to be applied with appropriate modifications this means that in the absence of an applicable legal regulation the commencement of proceedings of alternative dispute resolution is governed by the default provision in the second sentence of article 1061 the proceedings starting on the date on which one partys request to have such proceedings reaches the other party since the end of a dispute resolution procedure will very often be uncertain the reference to articles 105 and 106 and in particular to the phrase until the proceedings have been otherwise terminated in their paragraphs 2 is also to be applied with appropriate modifications thus a unilateral termination of the dispute resolution procedure by one of the parties art 108 unidroit principles 366 will suffice to terminate the suspension a unilateral termination that is made in bad faith is subject to article 17 i l l u s t r a t i o n the parties a hospital and a supplier of hospital equipment agree to submit disputes over prices to a board of mediation under the applicable rules a review by this board starts on the date on which one party submits a complaint to the other party who then has to invite the board to review the case under the applicable rules the mediation ends either when the board decides on the claim or there is a settlement between the parties or the claimants request is withdrawn article 108 suspension in case of force majeure death or incapacity 1 where the obligee has been prevented by an impediment that is beyond its control and that it could neither avoid nor overcome from causing a limitation period to cease to run under the preceding articles the general limitation period is suspended so as not to expire before one year after the relevant impediment has ceased to exist 2 where the impediment consists of the incapacity or death of the obligee or obligor suspension ceases when a representative for the incapacitated or deceased party or its estate has been appointed or a successor has inherited the respective partys position the additional one year period under paragraph 1 applies accordingly comment 1 effects of impediments most legal systems take into account impediments that prevent the obligee from pursuing its rights in court as does the un limitation convention see articles 15 and 21 it is a basic policy concept that limitation periods art 108 367 the obligee must have the possibility to pursue its rights before it can be deprived of them as a result of the lapse of time practical examples of impediments include war and natural disasters that prevent the obligee from reaching a competent court other cases of force majeure may also prevent the pursuance of a right and at least cause the suspension of the limitation period the impediment must be beyond the obligees control imprisonment therefore would suspend the limitation period only where it could not have been avoided such as in the case of a prisoner of war but the imprisonment of a criminal would not only the general limitation period is suspended however if the maximum period has elapsed before the obligee could pursue this right the obligee is subject to the defence of the expiration of the maximum limitation period i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 as lawyer plans to file a complaint against b an engineering firm for alleged professional malpractice by bs employees the limitation period will expire on 1 december and as lawyer has completed the complaint on 25 november intending to file it by express mail or in person with the clerk of the competent court on 24 november terrorists attack as country with biological weapons of mass destruction causing all traffic mail service and other social services to completely cease thus preventing the timely filing of as complaint the limitation period ceases to run and will not expire until one year after some means of communication has been restored in as country if however the disruption of all means of communication in as country lasts ten years as right is barred by the maximum limitation period 2 additional period of deliberation since impediments beyond the control of the obligee may occur and cease to exist towards the end of the limitation period it is possible that after the ceasing of the impediment only a very short time or no time at all might be left for the obligee to decide what to do this article therefore provides for an additional oneyear period of time from the date on which the impediment ceases to exist with a view to enabling the obligee to decide what course of action to take 3 incapacity and death incapacity and death of the obligee or of the obligor are but special examples of impediments to an effective pursuance of the obligees art 109 unidroit principles 368 right paragraph 2 provides for the same solution as in the case of general impediments i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a lends b money which is due to be repaid on 1 january a does not seek repayment for a long time and dies thirtyfive months after the date for repayment the law of succession applicable to as estate requires that an administrator appointed by the court administer the estate and collect outstanding debts since the docket of the competent court is overcrowded it takes two and a half years for an administrator to be appointed the administrator has one month left of the threeyear general limitation period plus an additional oneyear period to pursue the deceased partys claim against b before the limitation period expires article 109 effects of expiration of limitation period 1 the expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the right 2 for the expiration of the limitation period to have effect the obligor must assert it as a defence 3 a right may still be relied on as a defence even though the expiration of the limitation period for that right has been asserted comment 1 no extinction of the right the expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the obligors right but only bars its enforcement 2 expiration of the limitation period must be raised as a defence the effects of the expiration of the limitation period do not occur automatically they only occur if the obligor raises the expiration as a defence the obligor can do so in any proceedings in accordance with the applicable law and also outside of proceedings by invoking the limitation periods art 1010 369 expiration of the limitation period the existence of the defence can also be the subject of a declaratory judgement i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 a purchases goods from b part of the purchase price is due on 1 april and is not paid thirtyeight months later b files a complaint against a a does not invoke the expiration of the limitation period nor does it appear in court and b moves for a defaultjudgment judgment will be for b since a did not raise the expiration of the limitation period as a defence 3 use of a timebarred right as a defence since under the principles the expiration of a limitation period does not extinguish the right but only gives a defence that must be asserted by the obligor paragraphs 1 and 2 it follows that the obligees right still exists although a claim for its performance may be barred by the obligors assertion of the expiration of the limitation period it can therefore be used as a defence eg as grounds for the retention of performance by the obligee paragraph 3 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 a leases a printing press to b for ten years under the contract a is obliged to maintain the press in working condition and to undertake repairs unless a defect is caused by bs negligence in operating the machine the machine breaks down but a refuses to do the necessary repairs b after futile requests and negotiations with a has the repairs done by another company and asks a to pay the necessary costs a does not react and b does not pursue the matter five years later at the end of the lease b again requests payment of the costs of the repairs a refuses to pay and invokes article 1021 requesting the return of the printing press b is entitled to damages for breach of contract and to withhold delivery of the press article 1010 right of setoff the obligee may exercise the right of setoff until the obligor has asserted the expiration of the limitation period art 1011 unidroit principles 370 comment as the obligees right continues to exist it can be used for setoff if the prerequisites of setoff under article 81 are met i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 to article 109 except that a not only asks for the return of the press but also for the payment of the unpaid rent b is entitled to set off its counterclaim for damages against this monetary claim despite the expiration of the limitation period although the expiration of the limitation period does not in itself extinguish the right of the obligee the situation changes when the obligor invokes the time bar as a defence by asserting it against the obligee by so doing the obligor makes the limitation period effective with the consequence that the right can no longer be enforced since set off may be considered the selfenforcement of a right it is not available after the defence of the expiration of the limitation period has been invoked i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b requests the payment of damages and threatens to sue four years after having had the repairs done a objects asserting that the machine broke down due to bs fault since this is hard to prove a in a letter to b also invokes the time bar under article 1021 b can no longer set off its claim for damages article 1011 restitution where there has been performance in order to discharge an obligation there is no right of restitution merely because the limitation period has expired comment 1 timebarred claim as valid basis for performance another consequence of the fact that under the principles the expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the right of the limitation periods art 1011 371 obligee but can only be asserted as a defence is that if the obligor performs despite its defence the obligation it performs remains effective as a legal basis for the obligees retaining the performance mere expiration of a limitation period cannot be used as grounds for an action to reclaim the performance under restitutionary or unjust enrichment principles 2 restitutionary claims based on other grounds despite the lapse of the limitation period a restitutionary claim can be based on grounds other than performance eg where a payor claims to have paid a nonexisting debt due to a mistake i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 bank b lends money to borrower a who does not repay on the date required by the loan agreement as debt is overlooked and forgotten because of a bookkeeping error on the part of b four years later b discovers its error and sends a a notice claiming repayment a complies with this request but later learns from a lawyer that it could have refused repayment on account of the expiration of the limitation period a cannot reclaim the payment as unjust enrichment from b 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that a has in fact repaid the loan but both sides are unaware of this four years later b erroneously requests payment from a and a complies a can recover the second payment because a has already paid a debt which has thus been extinguished by full performance 372 chapter 11 plurality of obligors and of obligees section 1 plurality of obligors article 1111 definitions when several obligors are bound by the same obligation towards an obligee a the obligations are joint and several when each obligor is bound for the whole obligation b the obligations are separate when each obligor is bound only for its share comment this chapter deals with situations where an obligation binds several obligors or gives rights to several obligees section 1 concerns the plurality of obligors 1 several obligors there are frequent cases when an obligation binds several obligors i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 companies a b and c decide to join efforts to penetrate a new market abroad they need financing and they obtain a loan together from bank x a b and c are coobligors of the obligation to reimburse the loan 2 contractors a and b are awarded a contract for the construction of a bridge based on a submission they have filed together a and b are coobligors of the obligation to build the bridge plurality of obligors art 1111 373 3 a large industrial plant has to be insured against fire and other hazards the risk is too large for the capacity of any single insurer several insurers coinsure the risk these insurers are coobligors of the obligation to cover the risk 4 bank x grants a loan to company a but requires a guarantee parent company b agrees to bind itself together with a for the reimbursement of the loan a and b are coobligors of the obligation to reimburse the loan 2 the same obligation this section only applies if the different obligors are bound by the same obligation it also frequently happens that several obligors are involved in the same operation but with distinct obligations they are not coobligors under the articles of this section i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 a new aeroplane is being built many subcontractors are involved in the various elements for instance subcontractor a is in charge of profiling the wings and subcontractor b of studying the electronic equipment their respective obligations are different they are not coobligors the same obligation usually but not necessarily arises from a single contract in illustrations 1 and 2 there will normally be a single loan contract or a single construction contract binding the different obligors however in the case of coinsurance illustration 3 it is frequent that each insurer even though undertaking to cover the same risk has its own distinct contract with the insured the guarantee offered in illustration 4 will often be granted in a distinct contract other examples of obligations undertaken by a different contract are cases in which obligations are transferred by agreement see article 921 et seq however the obligations concerned must be contractual irrespective of whether they arise from a single contract or out of several contracts tortious obligations of multiple tortfeasors are not governed by this chapter since the principles govern international commercial contracts contractual damage claims may fall under this chapter art 1112 unidroit principles 374 3 two main types of obligation article 1111 defines the two main types of obligation which exist in practice when several obligors are bound by the same obligation towards an obligee the first is where each obligor is bound for the whole obligation which means that the obligee may require performance from any one of them see article 1113 subject to contributory claims between the obligors at a later stage see article 11110 the second is where each obligor is bound only for its share which entitles the obligee to claim only that much from each of the obligors in the former situation which is the default rule see article 1112 obligations are called joint and several in the latter situation obligations are called separate whether coobligors are jointly and severally or separately bound is determined in accordance with article 1112 see illustrations 1 to 4 4 other possible situations the two main types of obligation illustrated above are the most common but this section does not intend to cover all possible arrangements other situations which can occur are those of socalled joint or communal obligations in which the obligors are bound to render performance together and the obligee may claim performance only from all of them together a typical example is that of a group of musicians having undertaken to perform a string quartet situations of this type are of less practical importance article 1112 presumption of joint and several obligations when several obligors are bound by the same obligation towards an obligee they are presumed to be jointly and severally bound unless the circumstances indicate otherwise plurality of obligors art 1112 375 comment 1 default rule in commercial practice the normal case is that several obligors that have undertaken the same obligation are jointly and severally bound towards the obligee this justifies the default rule expressed in article 1112 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 companies a b and c have together obtained a loan from bank x as in illustration 1 under article 1111 the loan contract fails to indicate how each of the parties is bound they are presumed to be joint and several obligors ie towards the bank each of them is bound for the whole amount of the loan 2 circumstances indicating otherwise the presumption of joint and several obligations is rebutted when the circumstances indicate otherwise this will often be the result of an explicit contractual provision to the contrary i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 insurers a b and c have agreed to coinsure an industrial plant as in illustration 3 under article 1111 the scheme provides that each coinsurer is only bound for a percentage of the risk other circumstances can also discard the presumption that plural obligors are jointly and severally bound i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 but insurers a b and c have omitted to stipulate that they are not jointly and severally bound however the very purpose of coinsurance is to cover large risks without putting any insurer beyond the limits of its own capacity this may be considered as a circumstance indicating that a b and c are only bound for their respective shares 3 suretyship and joint and several obligations a different situation is that of suretyship an accessory agreement by which a person binds itself for another already bound in case the main obligor defaults the surety is not bound as a principal but will only art 1113 unidroit principles 376 have to perform if the main obligor fails to do so principal and surety are bound separately and in a successive order i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 company a wants to borrow eur 1000000 from bank x the loan is granted on the condition that parent company b will act as surety for reimbursement of the loan a is xs main obligor b will be required to pay only if and when a defaults it may happen that the technique of joint and several obligations is used as a mechanism by which the economic benefit of suretyship may be obtained the obligee requests the company willing to guarantee the initial obligors obligation to intervene next to the latter as a joint and several obligor instead of entering into a separate agreement of suretyship the obligees advantage is that in such a case it can require payment directly from the intervening company this does not necessarily deprive the intervening company of the special rights provided to a surety under the law of suretyship i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 4 but x requires b to bind itself as a joint and several obligor next to a for reimbursement of the loan x may then require reimbursement directly from b as well as from a this particular use of the technique of joint and several obligations has some specific consequences see comment 3 on article 1119 concerning apportionment among joint and several obligors the law of suretyship may of course provide additional consequences article 1113 obligees rights against joint and several obligors when obligors are jointly and severally bound the obligee may require performance from any one of them until full performance has been received plurality of obligors art 1114 377 comment the main effect of joint and several obligations from the obligors point of view has already been stated in the definition given in article 1111 namely that each obligor is bound for the whole obligation article 1113 states the main effect for the obligee it may require performance from each obligor until full performance has been received i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 farmers a b and c have bought a tractor together for shared use in their respective fields they are jointly and severally bound to pay the price of usd 45000 seller x may require payment of the whole sum from a b or c xs claim is extinguished when it has received full performance from one or more of its obligors 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 a pays only usd 30000 in spite of being bound for usd 45000 x while still retaining a claim against a for the unpaid part may claim that amount of usd 15000 from b or c if x at this stage only receives usd 10000 from b though b was still bound for usd 15000 x may still claim usd 5000 from c as well as from a and b article 1114 availability of defences and rights of setoff a joint and several obligor against whom a claim is made by the obligee may assert all the defences and rights of setoff that are personal to it or that are common to all the coobligors but may not assert defences or rights of setoff that are personal to one or several of the other co obligors comment this article deals with the possibilities for a joint and several obligor to assert different defences and rights of setoff it distinguishes between on one side defences and rights of setoff that are personal to one of the obligors or common to all of them and on the other side defences and rights of setoff which are personal to one or several of the other coobligors art 1115 unidroit principles 378 i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 together companies a b and c have purchased machinery from manufacturer x to be used in their respective plants for a common project part of the purchase price has to be paid at a future date the outstanding amount being jointly and severally due a has obtained a separate undertaking from x that the machinery would meet a certain performance level if x requires a to pay the outstanding amount of the price a may assert the fact that the machinery does not meet the guaranteed level of performance on the other hand if x claims payment from b and c the latter may not assert that the level of performance is insufficient since the defence is personal to a 2 companies a and b jointly and severally have undertaken to purchase a certain quantity of steel from seller x government authorities in the buyers country declare an embargo on all trade with the sellers country which renders performance of the contract unlawful this is a common defence which each of the coobligors may assert against x 3 bank x has lent eur 2000000 to joint and several obligors a and b as a result of the selling of shares belonging to a on the stock market x becomes as obligor for an amount of eur 500000 a may exercise its right of setoff against x with the effects provided for in article 1115 on the contrary b may not assert this right which is personal to a article 1115 effect of performance or setoff performance or setoff by a joint and several obligor or setoff by the obligee against one joint and several obligor discharges the other obligors in relation to the obligee to the extent of the performance or setoff comment 1 performance by a joint and several obligor if one of the coobligors has already fully or partially performed the obligation the other obligors may successfully assert this as a defence plurality of obligors art 1115 379 should the obligee still attempt to claim performance from the other co obligors i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 companies a b and c are jointly bound to reimburse a loan of eur 100000 upon lender xs request a fully reimburses the loan b and c can avail themselves of as performance if x still claims reimbursement of the loan from them 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 but a only reimburses eur 30000 b and c are still jointly and severally bound for eur 70000 see article 1113 but they may invoke as partial payment if x still claims the full amount from them 2 setoff the rule laid down in this article with respect to performance by one of the coobligors also applies with appropriate adaptations in the case of setoff between the obligee and one of the obligors rights of setoff have already been mentioned in article 1114 where the issue is to determine which of the coobligors could assert rights of setoff article 1115 deals with the subsequent issue of the effects of setoff once it has been exercised on the rules governing setoff itself see articles 81 to 85 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in the preceding illustrations a b and c are jointly bound to reimburse a loan of eur 100000 to x however on the basis of a different transaction a has become xs obligee for an amount of eur 60000 if a exercises its right of set off against x by serving appropriate notice as provided in article 83 it will have the same effect as partial performance by a of its joint and several obligation thus discharging b and c for the corresponding amount the same rule applies if the right of setoff has been exercised by the obligee against one of the joint and several obligors i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 but it is x who takes the initiative to give the setoff notice to a the effects are identical a is discharged for the amount of setoff eur 60000 and the other coobligors b and c are also discharged for the same amount art 1116 unidroit principles 380 article 1116 effect of release or settlement 1 release of one joint and several obligor or settlement with one joint and several obligor discharges all the other obligors for the share of the released or settling obligor unless the circumstances indicate otherwise 2 when the other obligors are dis charged for the share of the released obligor they no longer have a contributory claim against the released obligor under article 11110 comment 1 release of one joint and several obligor if the obligee releases one of its joint and several obligors with no further qualifications article 1116 provides as the default rule that the release affects only the share of the released obligor as determined by article 1119 as a consequence the other obligors are discharged for the share of the released obligor only and remain bound for the difference i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 bank x lends eur 300000 to companies a b and c the obligors are jointly and severally bound their respective contributory shares are equal ie eur 100000 each x releases a with no further qualification the consequence for b and c is that they are released for the amount of as share of eur 100000 b and c remain jointly and severally bound towards x for an amount of eur 200000 2 settlement with one joint and several obligor sometimes the obligee receives payment from one of the coobligors of an amount less than that obligors share as determined by article 19 as part of a separate settlement with that obligor pursuant to which the payment received is accepted as discharging all of the settling obligors share consequently the other obligors joint and several obligations are reduced not only by the amount paid but by the full initial amount of the settling obligors share plurality of obligors art 1116 381 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 investors a b and c are jointly and severally bound to pay seller x usd 3000000 for an acquisition of shares a and x come to a settlement of different disputes between themselves one of the terms of the settlement is that a will be discharged of its obligations towards x under the share purchase agreement by paying an amount of usd 600000 ie usd 400000 less than as contributory share towards the other coobligors under these circumstances x may not claim the whole remaining usd 2400000 against b and c their joint and several obligations are reduced by the full initial amount of as share ie usd 1000000 they are still jointly and severally bound for usd 2000000 only 3 circumstances indicating otherwise there can be circumstances where the other obligors are discharged for another amount other than that of the released or settling obligors share for instance the obligee may release one of its obligors only for part of the latters share as determined by article 1119 the other obligors will be discharged only for the amount of that released part all obligors will remain jointly and severally bound for the reduced total amount i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that x releases a for an amount of eur 60000 the consequence for b and c is that they are released for the same amount of eur 60000 a b and c remain jointly and severally bound towards x for an amount of eur 240000 on the other hand the obligee may also intend to fully release all of its obligors if the obligee expresses its intention so to do article 1116 does not apply as to settlement it will frequently not be separate but concern all joint and several obligors the consequences for the different obligors obligations will in these cases be determined by the terms of the settlement agreed by all parties and the contributory claims will be adjusted accordingly art 1117 unidroit principles 382 4 no more contributory claim if the obligee has released one of the coobligors or settled with it and the other coobligors have been discharged of the released obligors share the other coobligors have no more contributory claim against the released obligor i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 a is released by x while b and c remain jointly and severally bound for an amount of eur 200000 if b pays x eur 200000 b has a contributory claim of eur 100000 against c but no claim against a 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 b and c continue to be jointly and severally bound for an amount of usd 2000000 if b pays usd 2000000 to x b has a contributory claim of usd 1000000 against c but b has no claim against a even though a has paid x only usd 600000 as agreed in their separate settlement article 1117 effect of expiration or suspension of limitation period 1 expiration of the limitation period of the obligees rights against one joint and several obligor does not affect a the obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors or b the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under article 11110 2 if the obligee initiates proceedings under articles 105 106 or 107 against one joint and several obligor the running of the limitation period is also suspended against the other joint and several obligors comment 1 expiration of the limitation period against one obligor the obligees rights against one or several of the joint and several obligors may become timebarred this does not prevent the obligee plurality of obligors art 1117 383 from exercising its claim against the other coobligors whose obligations are not yet affected by the expiration of a period of limitation i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 companies a and b are jointly and severally bound to pay consultant x fees of usd 500000 on 1 january a and b refuse to pay arguing that the services rendered by x were unsatisfactory the parties enter into lengthy discussions two years later in the course of the year b comes to acknowledge xs rights but a continues to challenge them in march the following year x finally sues both clients for payment more than three years after the date when xs fees were due see article 102 xs claim against a is timebarred the situation is different for b who acknowledged the right of the obligee before the expiration of the limitation period thus triggering the running of a new period see article 104 x can still claim usd 500000 from b coobligors who have paid the obligee under such circumstances can exercise their rights of recourse in accordance with article 11110 even against the coobligor who could avail itself of the expiration of a period of limitation against the obligee in accordance with article 109 these rights of recourse are subject to their own limitation periods i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 in the case described in illustration 1 b after paying usd 500000 to x can claim contribution from a under article 11110 2 suspension of the limitation period against one obligor initiation by the obligee of legal or arbitral proceedings or an adr procedure against one of the joint and several obligors suspends the running of the limitation period against that obligor under articles 105 106 or 107 article 11172 extends the effect of the suspension to the other coobligors i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 cobuyers a and b are jointly and severally bound to pay seller x a sum of gbp 800000 which was due on 31 december in spite of several reminders a and b are still in default close to the end of the threeyear limitation period on 20 december three years later x initiates legal proceedings against a the limitation period is suspended not only against a but also against b art 1118 unidroit principles 384 the rule in article 11172 which creates effects towards all co obligors adopts an approach different from that in the rule in article 11171 which provides for individual effects indeed different effects are concerned those of expiration of the limitation period and those of initiating legal proceedings the solution adopted in paragraph 2 saves the expenses involved in initiating proceedings against all obligors the obligee should however keep in mind the rule in article 1118 concerning effect of judgments article 1118 effect of judgment 1 a decision by a court as to the liability to the obligee of one joint and several obligor does not affect a the obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors or b the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under article 11110 2 however the other joint and several obligors may rely on such a decision except if it was based on grounds personal to the obligor concerned in such a case the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under article 11110 are affected accordingly comment 1 no effect on the other obligors obligations if the obligee commences judicial or arbitral proceedings against only one or some of the joint and several obligors any decision by the court will not in principle affect the obligations of the coobligors who were not called to court whatever the decision the other obligors will still be bound in the original terms i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 bank c has loaned eur 1000000 to joint and several borrowers a and b a is sued for reimbursement by x and the court orders a to pay x eur 1000000 this decision in itself plurality of obligors art 1118 385 does not affect bs obligation b is still bound to pay eur 1000000 to x naturally if the judgment is enforced and a pays x eur 1000000 b obligation towards x will be extinguished under article 1115 and b will be subject to as contributory recourse under article 11110 2 company a and company b have jointly and severally undertaken to provide transportation for company xs deliveries to its clients performance is defective and x sues a the court orders a to pay damages b is not bound by that finding of defective performance and its obligations are not increased by the amount of the damages 2 no effect on the rights of recourse a court decision rendered against one joint and several obligor furthermore has no effect on the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under article 11110 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 a pays x the damages ordered by the court a may not claim to recover part of the damages from b 3 right of the other joint and several obligors to avail themselves of the decision the principle stated in paragraph 1 of this article does not have to be enforced when the other coobligors find it in their interest to rely on the decision for such cases paragraph 2 grants the other joint and several obligors the right to rely on it however the rule does not apply when the decision was based on grounds personal to the obligor concerned i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 art collectors a and b have joined in purchasing a painting at an auction and they are jointly and severally bound to pay the price of gbp 800000 the price is not paid and the auction house sues a the court accepts some of as arguments concerning the quality of the painting which appears to have been restored and reduces the price to gbp 600000 b may rely on that decision to benefit from the same reduction of its obligations towards the auction house 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 4 except that as refusal to pay the auction house is grounded on a claim that the painting is a fake this is confirmed by an expert opinion ordered art 1119 unidroit principles 386 by the court accordingly the contract is avoided b may also rely on that decision to be discharged of its obligations towards the auction house 6 the facts are the same as in illustration 4 except that a had separately obtained from the auction house a certificate stating that the painting had been shown at some major exhibitions this turns out to be untrue and a court orders the auction house to pay damages to a b may not rely on that decision since it is based on grounds personal to a 4 rights of recourse affected accordingly if a joint and several obligor avails itself of a court decision rendered against its coobligor the right of recourse of the coobligor will be affected accordingly i l l u s t r a t i o n 7 the facts are the same as in illustration 4 as obligation towards the auction house has been reduced to gbp 600000 if a after having paid this amount to the auction house initiates a contributory recourse against b the latter may avail itself of the court decision to have its contributory share reduced accordingly article 1119 apportionment among joint and several obligors as among themselves joint and several obligors are bound in equal shares unless the circumstances indicate otherwise comment articles 1119 to 11113 of this section deal with contributory claims an obligor who has performed the obligation in favour of the obligee has a claim against the other joint and several obligors to recuperate their respective shares the first issue is to determine these respective shares as a default rule article 1119 states that these shares are equal plurality of obligors art 11110 387 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 companies a and b have borrowed eur 10000000 from bank x to finance the acquisition of stock in another company in principle as and bs shares in the final allocation will be eur 5000000 each however circumstances can indicate otherwise ie that the shares are unequal this will often result from the contractual arrangements between the coobligors i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that a and b have agreed that their respective participations in the acquisition would be 75 and 25 there is a presumption that these percentages will also govern the final allocation the circumstances may indicate that some obligors are ultimately to bear the whole amount of the obligation this is the case when a party agrees to be bound as joint and several obligor not because of its own interest in the operation but to serve as guarantor for the other main obligor see comment 3 on article 1112 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 company a applies for a loan of eur 10000000 from bank x the loan is granted on the condition that company b intervene as joint and several obligor as between the two companies it is understood that b only serves as a guarantor the circumstances indicate that the shares in the final allocation should be 100 for a and 0 for b article 11110 extent of contributory claim a joint and several obligor who has performed more than its share may claim the excess from any of the other obligors to the extent of each obligors unperformed share art 11110 unidroit principles 388 comment after a joint and several obligor has paid more than its share to the obligee it has contributory claims against the other obligors to recover the excess on the basis of the respective shares i l l u s t r a t i o n s 1 companies a and b have borrowed eur 10000000 from bank x to finance the acquisition of stock in another company as and bs shares are in principle equal if a has reimbursed the full amount to x it can claim contribution from b for the amount in excess of as own share of 50 ie eur 5000000 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that a and b have agreed that their respective participations in the acquisition would be 75 and 25 if a has ultimately to bear 75 of the reimbursement a can only recuperate the excess ie bs share of eur 2500000 3 company a applies for a loan of eur 10000000 from bank x the loan is granted on the condition that company b intervene as a joint and several obligor as between the two companies it is understood that b only serves as a guarantor as share is 100 if b has repaid the loan to x b can claim full reimbursement from a the rule in article 11110 can also apply in more complex circumstances i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 investors a b and c have joined efforts to buy an office building the total price amounts to usd 1000000 but the respective agreed shares are 50 30 and 20 the seller is entitled to request payment of usd 1000000 from any of the obligors but it can only recover usd 650000 from a the seller then recovers the remaining usd

respectively have contributory claims of usd 150000 and usd 50000 against c articles 11162 11171b and 1118b provide for particular rules on the availability of contributory claims under the circumstances respectively governed by these provisions plurality of obligors art 11111 389 article 11111 rights of the obligee 1 a joint and several obligor to whom article 11110 applies may also exercise the rights of the obligee including all rights securing their performance to recover the excess from all or any of the other obligors to the extent of each obligors unperformed share 2 an obligee who has not received full performance retains its rights against the co obligors to the extent of the unperformed part with precedence over coobligors exercising contributory claims comment 1 subrogation in the obligees rights a joint and several obligor who has paid more than its share to the obligee has a contributory claim against the other obligors under article 11110 article 111111 gives the coobligor who has such a contributory claim the possibility of benefiting from the rights of the obligee including all rights securing their performance this possibility is of particular value to the joint and several obligor when the rights of the obligee are secured because the contributory right under article 11110 is not secured i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 bank x has lent eur 500000 to companies a and b as joint and several obligors secured by a mortgage on as premises b reimburses the full amount of the loan under article 11110 b has an unsecured claim against a for contribution in the amount of eur 250000 b may also exercise xs rights against a up to the amount of eur 250000 including enforcement of the mortgage on as premises 2 obligees rights reserved and preferred by providing that an obligee who has not received full performance retains its rights against the joint and several obligors and by giving those retained rights of the obligee precedence over the rights of the performing obligor the rule in article 111112 assures that the art 11112 unidroit principles 390 benefit given to the joint and several obligor in article 111111 does not detrimentally affect the remaining rights of the obligee this precedence may be effectuated by deferring enforcement of the claim of the performing joint and several obligor under article 111111 until full performance is received by the obligee i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that b has reimbursed only eur 400000 of the loan and the remaining eur 100000 remain unpaid b has a contributory claim against a for the amount in excess of its own share ie eur 150000 eur 400000 eur 250000 b also has the right to exercise xs rights against a up to that amount including enforcement of the mortgage on as premises however as xs rights with respect to the remaining eur 100000 have precedence over the rights of b enforcement of bs rights against a may not occur until after x has received repayment of the remaining eur 100000 the rule on precedence is subject to the possible application of mandatory rules providing otherwise in insolvency proceedings article 11112 defences in contributory claims a joint and several obligor against whom a claim is made by the coobligor who has performed the obligation a may raise any common defences and rights of setoff that were available to be asserted by the coobligor against the obligee b may assert defences which are personal to itself c may not assert defences and rights of setoff which are personal to one or several of the other coobligors comment this provision deals with the defences and rights of setoff that may be asserted between coobligors when contributory claims are exercised plurality of obligors art 11112 391 1 common defences and rights of setoff pursuant to article 1114 the coobligor that is asked to perform by the obligee may assert all defences and rights of setoff common to all the coobligors if that coobligor has failed to raise such a defence or right of setoff which would have extinguished or reduced the obligation any other joint and several obligor against which the former obligor exercises a contributory claim may assert that defence or right of setoff i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 joint and several obligors a and b have purchased a knowhow licence together licensor x has undertaken that the technology was fit for both licencees if this appeared not to be the case each obligor could invoke this common defence against x if a fails to do so when required to pay the fees by x b may refuse to pay its contributory share to a 2 personal defences a coobligor may also assert a defence personal to itself against a contributory claim i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 companies a b and c are jointly and severally bound to pay the price of products to be purchased from seller x a however was induced to enter the contract by fraud within the meaning of article 38 b pays the full price to x a may assert the fraud it had been subjected to as a personal defence against bs contributory claim under article 11112 rights of setoff are not subject to the same rule as defences as they usually are in the principles the reason for this is that the rights of setoff cannot be treated in the same manner as defences when it comes to the asserting of a personal right of setoff against the obligee to counter a contributory claim in actual fact under article 1115 performance by the other coobligor has discharged the first obligor from its obligations towards the obligee with the consequence that the right of setoff does not exist any more the first obligor will have to pay its contributory share to the other obligor while remaining in a position to exercise its distinct claim against the obligee art 11113 unidroit principles 392 i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 bank x has lent eur 3000000 to joint and several obligors a and b as a result of the selling of shares belonging to a on the stock market x then becomes as obligor for an amount of eur 500000 thus giving a a right of setoff for that amount x claims reimbursement of eur 3000000 from b which pays the full amount if b then claims contribution from a the latter may not assert its own right of setoff against b such a right does not exist any more since payment to x by b has also discharged a towards x a will have to pay its contributory share to b and will be able to exercise its own claim of eur 500000 against x 3 defences and rights of setoff personal to other coobligors a coobligor may not assert a defence or right of setoff which is personal to one or several of the other coobligors i l l u s t r a t i o n s 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 2 if b claims contribution against c the latter may not invoke the fraud to which a was subject since this defence is personal to a 5 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 if b claims contribution from c the latter may not assert as right of setoff since this right is personal to another obligor article 11113 inability to recover if a joint and several obligor who has performed more than that obligors share is unable despite all reasonable efforts to recover contribution from another joint and several obligor the share of the others including the one who has performed is increased proportionally comment 1 proportional sharing of the loss a coobligor exercising a contributory claim against another co obligor may be unable to recover because the latter is insolvent or has plurality of obligors art 11113 393 disappeared or its assets are out of reach in this case the burden of the loss is spread among the other coobligors i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 companies a b and c borrow eur 6000000 from bank x their contributory shares being equal after reimbursing the loan a claims eur 2000000 from b and eur 2000000 from c b turns out to be insolvent the loss of eur 2000000 has to be borne proportionally by the other coobligors including the one who has performed since their shares are identical both a and c will bear an equal part of the loss ie eur 1000000 each consequently a can recover eur 3000000 from c 2 all reasonable efforts before invoking this article in order to claim increased contributions from the other coobligors the obligor who has performed must exert all reasonable efforts to recover from the defaulting coobligor in the light of article 5142 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 a does not question bs assertion that it is unable to pay because of financial difficulties and immediately asks for an increased contribution from c however in order to avail itself of article 11113 a must demonstrate that it has exerted all reasonable efforts to recover from b such as reminders injunctions attachments or legal proceedings as may be appropriate 394 section 2 plurality of obligees article 1121 definitions when several obligees can claim perform ance of the same obligation from an obligor a the claims are separate when each obligee can only claim its share b the claims are joint and several when each obligee can claim the whole performance c the claims are joint when all obligees have to claim performance together comment 1 several obligees plurality of obligees occurs in different situations i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 banks a b and c join in a syndicated loan agreement to lend company x usd 12000000 the three banks are plural obligees with regard to claiming reimbursement from x other instances of plurality of obligees occur among others with co insurers multiple buyers andor sellers in share acquisition agreements and partners in consortium agreements in various sectors such as the construction sector or the petroleum industry 2 the same obligation this section applies when the different obligees can claim performance of the same obligation from the obligor this is the case in illustration 1 reimbursement of the syndicated loan situations where different obligees of the same obligor have rights deriving from different obligations do not fall under the scope of this section plurality of obligees art 1121 395 i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 architect a and contractor b are both involved in the construction of a new industrial plant their respective claims against the client concern different obligations payment of their respective types of services the claims are not subject to the articles in this section but to the respectively applicable law on the other hand when different actors in a construction project join in a consortium and claim one payment for all their services they are to be considered as plural obligees for that payment the same obligation usually derives from a single contract in illustration 1 the syndicated loan agreement is a single contract it could however also happen in the same situation that each lender would choose to have its own contract with the borrower coinsurers joining to cover the same risk usually have distinct contractual relationships with the insured i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 eight insurance companies agree to coinsure the liability risks of a pharmaceutical group the coinsurance agreement provides that each coinsurer has a distinct contractual relationship with the insured but the insureds obligations towards the coinsurers are the same payment of the agreed premium required prevention measures loss notification etc these coinsurers are plural obligees subject as such to the articles in this section 3 three main types article 1121 defines three main types of claims available in practice when several obligees can claim performance of the same obligation from an obligor the claims can be separate each obligee can then claim only its share i l l u s t r a t i o n 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 if the claims of banks a b and c against x totalling usd 12000000 are separate and if their shares are equal each bank may only claim reimbursement of usd 4000000 from x the claims can be joint and several which means that each obligee can claim full performance see article 1122 subject to subsequent allocation between the different obligees see article 1124 art 1121 unidroit principles 396 i l l u s t r a t i o n 5 companies a and b are coowners of a storage house which they rent to transport company x the contract provides that the co owners claims for the rent are joint and several a and b may each claim payment of the full amount of the rent from x the claims are joint when all obligees have to claim together consequently the obligor may only perform in favour of all of them together this situation is sometimes also referred to as communal claims i l l u s t r a t i o n 6 companies a and b rent an office together to share in a foreign capital due to the nature of their claim on occupation of the office a and b are joint obligees this would not prevent them from designating one of them as agent for dealings with the owner of the premises 4 no presumption provided in the case of plurality of obligors article 1112 sets a presumption of joint and several obligations because this corresponds to the most frequent commercial practice on the contrary when it comes to determining to which of the three types defined in this article claims by plural obligees belong the principles do not provide any presumption the reason is that none of these types seems to be dominant in practice choices vary considerably mainly depending on the operation concerned consequently in situations where plural obligees are involved parties are encouraged to choose the relevant type by an express stipulation i l l u s t r a t i o n s 7 banks a b and c join in a syndicated loan agreement to offer financing to company x the agreement provides that all amounts due and obligations owed to each bank are separate and independent obligations each bank may separately enforce its rights under this agreement this express provision makes the banks claims separate 8 art collectors a and b coowners of a painting by rothko sell it to a museum for the price of usd 20000000 the contract stipulates that each seller can claim payment of the whole price the claims are joint and several plurality of obligees art 1121 397 9 the facts are the same as in illustration 8 except that the sales contract with the museum provides that a and bs claims are separate this means that each of them can only claim payment of the price for its own share of the claim normally corresponding to its previous share of ownership before making such a contractual choice parties should pay attention to the advantages and disadvantages of each of the different types of plural claim in particular joint and several claims have the advantage of avoiding the multiplication of law suits this is an especially important concern in international trade any of the obligees may claim the whole performance joint and several claims also simplify the situation of the obligor who will not have to divide performance between its different obligees from the point of view of the plural obligees themselves claims are normally easier if they are joint and several on the other hand plural obligees have to be aware that if their claims are joint and several they lose exclusive control of their respective shares any other joint and several obligee may claim and collect the whole performance with the risk that later allocation under article 1125 could create difficulties this explains why separate claims seem to be more prevalent in certain sectors see for instance illustration 1 if the parties have failed to make an explicit contractual choice the type to which a plural claim should be assigned will be determined by interpretation of the contract in accordance with the provisions in chapter 4 in many instances circumstances such as the nature or the purpose of the contract will be especially relevant see article 43d i l l u s t r a t i o n s 10 company a located in country x and company b located in country y join in ordering a large quantity of cars from a manufacturer the cars for country x are righthand drive those for country y lefthand drive when delivery is to be claimed these circumstances indicate that a and b are separate obligees each one being entitled to claim its type of car 11 tax consultant x has undertaken to give tax advice to companies a and b concerning the operations of a joint venture in which the latter are involved since the tax advice concerns the common venture of a and b and this advice is hardly divisible a and b are to be considered as joint and several obligees when claiming performance from x art 1122 unidroit principles 398 5 possible designation of an agent in practice plural obligees often designate an agent with the authority to deal with the obligor on behalf of all of them within agreed limits this seems to be especially frequent for practical reasons when the claims are separate however in that case each obligee intends to keep full control of its own rights often reserving the possibility to revoke the agents authority at any time i l l u s t r a t i o n 12 banks a b and c have joined in a syndicated loan agreement to lend usd 12000000 to company x the claims are separate usd 4000000 for each bank however a has been designated as agent of the consortium with authority to collect reimbursement of the full amount the initiative of designating an intermediary may come from an obligor who wants to exert some control over claims which could be separately brought by its numerous obligees i l l u s t r a t i o n 13 under the terms of issue of a bearer bond trustees are appointed to represent the interests of bondholders the issuer covenants to make payments to each bondholder in accordance with the terms of issue and gives the trustee a parallel payment covenant upon the issuers default the trustee may at its discretion enforce payment and must do so if so required by a given percentage in value of bondholders individual bondholders are precluded from taking action on default by the issuer unless the trustee for the bondholders has failed to fulfil its obligation under the trust deed to take enforcement action each bondholder is a separate obligee the purpose of the trust is simply to monitor performance by the issuer and coordinate enforcement in order to avoid precipitate action by an individual bondholder article 1122 effects of joint and several claims full performance of an obligation in favour of one of the joint and several obligees discharges the obligor towards the other obligees plurality of obligees art 1122 399 comment 1 each obligee can claim full performance the main effect of joint and several claims has already been stated in the definition of article 11212 when claims are joint and several each obligee is entitled to claim full performance from the obligor i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 coowners a and b sell their hotel to buyer x for a price of eur 5000000 their shares of coownership are equal the sales contract provides that the sellers claims concerning payment of the price are joint and several a may claim eur 5000000 from x subject to further allocation under article 1124 2 obligors choice this article states two other major effects of joint and several claims first if the obligor takes the initiative to spontaneously perform its obligation it is entitled to render performance in favour of any of its obligees i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 x takes the initiative of paying the price before being invited to do so by either of its obligees x may validly pay to a or to b 3 obligors discharge another main effect of joint and several claims is that the obligor who has rendered full performance in favour of one of the obligees is discharged towards the other obligees i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 x has paid the whole price of eur 5000000 to a b having difficulties to recover its share from a requests payment of eur 2500000 from x under article 11222 the claim will be rejected since full payment to a has discharged x towards the other obligee art 1123 unidroit principles 400 4 practical aspects the right given to each of the joint or several obligees to claim full performance may call for some coordination to avoid duplication of initiatives and unnecessary costs either the obligees have agreed in advance on which of them will claim performance or at least the obligee envisaging to take the initiative should consult with its co obligees on the other hand when the obligor takes the initiative its choice of obligee to which it will perform may be affected by the fact that another obligee is already requesting performance some prior consulting may then be appropriate furthermore an obligee who has received payment should immediately inform the others that performance has been rendered these solutions could usefully be agreed in advance by all parties involved otherwise the requirements of good faith and fair dealing are always applicable article 17 article 1123 availability of defences against joint and several obligees 1 the obligor may assert against any of the joint and several obligees all the defences and rights of setoff that are personal to its relationship to that obligee or that it can assert against all the coobligees but may not assert defences and rights of setoff that are personal to its relationship to one or several of the other co obligees 2 the provisions of articles 1115 1116 1117 and 1118 apply with appropriate adaptations to joint and several claims comment 1 availability of defences the defences which may entitle the obligor to refuse to perform do not necessarily exist against all obligees some of the defences may be personal to the obligors relationship with one obligee only these defences can be asserted only against the obligee concerned plurality of obligees art 1123 401 i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 grain producer x has agreed to supply a certain quantity of wheat seeds to companies a b and c which are engaged in a common agricultural project in a developing country the contract provides that a b and c are joint and several obligees as concerns the deliveries x discovers that the premises where it has to deliver the seeds are not equipped with appropriate facilities for convenient unloading the availability of which only a has guaranteed x may invoke this as a defence against a requiring delivery but not against b and c which had not guaranteed that the premises for the delivery would be equipped with appropriate facilities the obligor may also assert defences that it has in common against all obligees i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 x finds out that the agricultural project involves child labour by a b and c in violation of applicable mandatory rules this is a common defence that x may assert against any one of the obligees claiming delivery of the wheat seeds 2 effects of certain defences section 1 of this chapter contains particular rules about the effects of certain types of defence see articles 1115 1116 1117 and 1118 available to joint and several obligors paragraph 3 of this article provides that these rules apply with appropriate adaptations to joint and several claims a performance and setoff reference to article 1115 article 1115 provides that performance or setoff by a joint and several obligor or setoff by the obligee against one joint and several obligor discharges the other obligors in relation to the obligee to the extent of the performance or setoff similarly performance received by or setoff exercised by one of the joint and several obligees discharges the obligor towards the other obligees to the extent of the performance or setoff i l l u s t r a t i o n s 3 companies a b and c have jointly and severally loaned eur 300000 to x a receives full payment if b or c still claims reimbursement x may assert that it has fully performed to a art 1123 unidroit principles 402 4 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 except that x can claim eur 300000 from a for the sale of office equipment x exercises the right of setoff under article 83 its obligation under the loan agreement is extinguished not only visvis a but also vis vis b and c b release and settlement reference to article 1116 article 1116 provides that release of one joint and several obligor or settlement with one joint and several obligor discharges all the other obligors for the share of the released or settling obligor unless the circumstances indicate otherwise similarly release granted to the obligor by one of the obligees or settlement with the obligor by one of the obligees discharges the obligor towards the other obligees to the extent of the release or settlement i l l u s t r a t i o n s 5 pamela a famous race horse has been sold by its coowners a and b to buyer x concerning payment of the price the contract provides that a and b are joint and several obligees if a releases x from as share of xs obligation bs claim against x is reduced by the amount of as share a has no contributory recourse against b under article 1124 see article 11162 6 the facts are the same as in illustration 3 but a whose share in the loan is eur 100000 settles with x accepting a payment of eur 60000 ie an amount below its share the joint and several claims of b and c against x are reduced by the full amount of as share ie by eur 100000 and both remain xs joint and several obligees for eur 200000 settling obligee a has no recourse under article 1124 against b or c see article 11162 as in article 1116 with appropriate adaptations the reference to settlement concerns the special case where a separate settlement intervenes between the obligor and one of the joint and several obligees for the latters share in this case the issue to be solved is that of the consequences of such a settlement for the other obligees claims in the more frequent situation where the settlement concerns all the joint and several claims the consequences for the different obligees claims are determined by the terms of the settlement agreed by all parties and the contributory claims are adjusted accordingly plurality of obligees art 1123 403 c expiration of limitation periods reference to article 1117 article 1117 provides that the expiration of the limitation period of the obligees rights against one joint and several obligor affects neither a the obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors nor b the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under article 11110 similarly the expiration of the limitation period of one of the obligees rights against the obligor affects neither a the obligors obligations towards the other joint and several obligees nor b the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligees under article 1124 i l l u s t r a t i o n 7 obligor x has three joint and several obligees a b and c as claim against x is timebarred this does not affect b and cs claims against x if b or c receives performance from x a can claim its share from the coobligee having received payment article 1117 also provides that if the obligee initiates proceedings under articles 105 106 or 107 against one joint and several obligor the running of the limitation period is suspended also against the other joint and several obligors similarly if one of the obligees initiates proceedings against the obligor the running of the limitation period is also suspended in favour of the other joint and several obligees d effect of judgment reference to article 1118 article 1118 provides that a decision by a court as to the liability to the obligee of one joint and several obligor affect neither a the obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors nor b the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under article 11110 similarly a decision by a court as to the obligors liability towards one of the joint and several obligees affects neither a the obligors obligations towards the other joint and several obligees nor b the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligees under article 1124 i l l u s t r a t i o n 8 obligor x has three joint and several obligees a b and c a acting alone sues x for performance the judgement grants a only part of its claim such judgment does not affect the obligations of x towards b or c nor the recourses between the coobligees under article 1124 art 1124 unidroit principles 404 however article 11182 also provides that the other joint and several obligors may rely on such a decision except if it were based on grounds personal to the obligor concerned in this case the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under article 11110 are affected accordingly similarly the other joint and several obligees may rely on the decision if they find it in their interest except if it was based on grounds personal to the obligee concerned i l l u s t r a t i o n 9 the facts are the same as in illustration 8 this time however the judgment gives full satisfaction to a including the awarding of additional damages the other obligees may avail themselves of this favourable decision article 1124 allocation between joint and several obligees 1 as among themselves joint and several obligees are entitled to equal shares unless the circumstances indicate otherwise 2 an obligee who has received more than its share must transfer the excess to the other obligees to the extent of their respective shares comment 1 presumption of equal shares joint and several obligees may each claim full performance of the whole obligation under article 1122 however as among themselves they are only entitled to their respective shares these shares are presumed to be equal i l l u s t r a t i o n 1 coowners a and b have sold their factory for sfr 10000000 and they are joint and several obligees for the payment of the price however once the buyer has paid sfr 10000000 each coowner will be entitled to receive its share in the final allocation in principle the shares are considered to be equal each coowner should receive sfr 5000000 plurality of obligees art 1124 405 however the circumstances may indicate otherwise i l l u s t r a t i o n 2 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 except that the shares of coownership of the factory were not equal but 75 for a and 25 for b this will indicate that a should receive sfr 7500000 and b sfr 2500000 2 transfer of excess received it will usually happen that the coobligee claiming payment receives more than its share as it is entitled to claim full performance under article 1122 when an obligee has received more than its share it must transfer the excess to the other obligees to the extent of their respective shares i l l u s t r a t i o n 3 the facts are the same as in illustration 1 a has been paid the full price of the factory ie sfr 10000000 and its share of co ownership was 50 a must transfer sfr 5000000 to b whether the claim of the other obligees to the sums in excess is a property right or merely a personal claim against the obligee who received more than its share is outside the scope of the principles annex while recalling that the comments on the articles are to be seen as an integral part of the principles the text of the articles is reproduced separately in this annex for the convenience of the reader 409 unidroit principles of international commercial contracts 2016 preamble purpose of the principles these principles set forth general rules for international commercial contracts they shall be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by them they may be applied when the parties have agreed that their contract be governed by general principles of law the lex mercatoria or the like they may be applied when the parties have not chosen any law to govern their contract they may be used to interpret or supplement international uniform law instruments they may be used to interpret or supplement domestic law they may serve as a model for national and international legislators chapter 1 general provisions article 11 freedom of contract the parties are free to enter into a contract and to determine its content article 12 no form required nothing in these principles requires a contract statement or any other act to be made in or evidenced by a particular form it may be proved by any means including witnesses article 13 binding character of contract a contract validly entered into is binding upon the parties it can only be modified or terminated in accordance with its terms or by agreement or as otherwise provided in these principles article 14 mandatory rules nothing in these principles shall restrict the application of mandatory rules whether of national international or supranational origin which are applicable in accordance with the relevant rules of private international law article 15 exclusion or modification by the parties the parties may exclude the application of these principles or derogate from or vary the effect of any of their provisions except as otherwise provided in the principles parties wishing to provide that their agreement be governed by the principles might use one of the model clauses for the use of the unidroit principles of international commercial contracts see httpwwwunidroitorginstrumentscommercialcontractsupiccmodelclauses unidroit principles 410 article 16 interpretation and supplementation of the principles 1 in the interpretation of these principles regard is to be had to their international character and to their purposes including the need to promote uniformity in their application 2 issues within the scope of these principles but not expressly settled by them are as far as possible to be settled in accordance with their underlying general principles article 17 good faith and fair dealing 1 each party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing in international trade 2 the parties may not exclude or limit this duty article 18 inconsistent behaviour a party cannot act inconsistently with an understanding it has caused the other party to have and upon which that other party reasonably has acted in reliance to its detriment article 19 usages and practices 1 the parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any practices which they have established between themselves 2 the parties are bound by a usage that is widely known to and regularly observed in international trade by parties in the particular trade concerned except where the application of such a usage would be unreasonable article 110 notice 1 where notice is required it may be given by any means appropriate to the circumstances 2 a notice is effective when it reaches the person to whom it is given 3 for the purpose of paragraph 2 a notice reaches a person when given to that person orally or delivered at that persons place of business or mailing address 4 for the purpose of this article notice includes a declaration demand request or any other communication of intention article 111 definitions in these principles court includes an arbitral tribunal where a party has more than one place of business the relevant place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract longterm contract refers to a contract which is to be performed over a period of time and which normally involves to a varying degree complexity of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between the parties obligor refers to the party who is to perform an obligation and obligee refers to the party who is entitled to performance of that obligation writing means any mode of communication that preserves a record of the information contained therein and is capable of being reproduced in tangible form annex 411 article 112 computation of time set by parties 1 official holidays or nonbusiness days occurring during a period set by parties for an act to be performed are included in calculating the period 2 however if the last day of the period is an official holiday or a nonbusiness day at the place of business of the party to perform the act the period is extended until the first business day which follows unless the circumstances indicate otherwise 3 the relevant time zone is that of the place of business of the party setting the time unless the circumstances indicate otherwise chapter 2 formation and authority of agents section 1 formation article 211 manner of formation a contract may be concluded either by the acceptance of an offer or by conduct of the parties that is sufficient to show agreement article 212 definition of offer a proposal for concluding a contract constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance article 213 withdrawal of offer 1 an offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree 2 an offer even if it is irrevocable may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer article 214 revocation of offer 1 until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree before it has dispatched an acceptance 2 however an offer cannot be revoked a if it indicates whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise that it is irrevocable or b if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer article 215 rejection of offer an offer is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror article 216 mode of acceptance 1 a statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance 2 an acceptance of an offer becomes effective when the indication of assent reaches the offeror 3 however if by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage the offeree may indicate assent by unidroit principles 412 performing an act without notice to the offeror the acceptance is effective when the act is performed article 217 time of acceptance an offer must be accepted within the time the offeror has fixed or if no time is fixed within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror an oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise article 218 acceptance within a fixed period of time a period of acceptance fixed by the offeror begins to run from the time that the offer is dispatched a time indicated in the offer is deemed to be the time of dispatch unless the circumstances indicate otherwise article 219 late acceptance delay in transmission 1 a late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without undue delay the offeror so informs the offeree or gives notice to that effect 2 if a communication containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless without undue delay the offeror informs the offeree that it considers the offer as having lapsed article 2110 withdrawal of acceptance an acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective article 2111 modified acceptance 1 a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counterof fer 2 however a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance unless the offeror without undue delay objects to the discrepancy if the offeror does not object the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance article 2112 writings in confirmation if a writing which is sent within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract and which purports to be a confirmation of the contract contains additional or different terms such terms become part of the contract unless they materially alter the contract or the recipient without undue delay objects to the discrepancy article 2113 conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on specific matters or in a particular form where in the course of negotiations one of the parties insists that the contract is not concluded until there is agreement on specific matters or in a particular form no contract is concluded before agreement is reached on those matters or in that form annex 413 article 2114 contract with terms deliberately left open 1 if the parties intend to conclude a contract the fact that they intentionally leave a term to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the parties or by a third person does not prevent a contract from coming into existence 2 the existence of the contract is not affected by the fact that subsequently a the parties reach no agreement on the term b the party who is to determine the term does not do so or c the third person does not determine the term provided that there is an alternative means of rendering the term definite that is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the intention of the parties article 2115 negotiations in bad faith 1 a party is free to negotiate and is not liable for failure to reach an agreement 2 however a party who negotiates or breaks off negotiations in bad faith is liable for the losses caused to the other party 3 it is bad faith in particular for a party to enter into or continue negotiations when intending not to reach an agreement with the other party article 2116 duty of confidentiality where information is given as confidential by one party in the course of negotiations the other party is under a duty not to disclose that information or to use it improperly for its own purposes whether or not a contract is subsequently concluded where appropriate the remedy for breach of that duty may include compensation based on the benefit received by the other party article 2117 merger clauses a contract in writing which contains a clause indicating that the writing completely embodies the terms on which the parties have agreed cannot be contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior statements or agreements however such statements or agreements may be used to interpret the writing article 2118 modification in a particular form a contract in writing which contains a clause requiring any modification or termination by agreement to be in a particular form may not be otherwise modified or terminated however a party may be precluded by its conduct from asserting such a clause to the extent that the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on that conduct article 2119 contracting under standard terms 1 where one party or both parties use standard terms in concluding a contract the general rules on formation apply subject to articles 2120 2122 2 standard terms are provisions which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party and which are actually used without negotiation with the other party unidroit principles 414 article 2120 surprising terms 1 no term contained in standard terms which is of such a character that the other party could not reasonably have expected it is effective unless it has been expressly accepted by that party 2 in determining whether a term is of such a character regard shall be had to its content language and presentation article 2121 conflict between standard terms and nonstandard terms in case of conflict between a standard term and a term which is not a standard term the latter prevails article 2122 battle of forms where both parties use standard terms and reach agreement except on those terms a contract is concluded on the basis of the agreed terms and of any standard terms which are common in substance unless one party clearly indicates in advance or later and without undue delay informs the other party that it does not intend to be bound by such a contract section 2 authority of agents article 221 scope of the section 1 this section governs the authority of a person the agent to affect the legal relations of another person the principal by or with respect to a contract with a third party whether the agent acts in its own name or in that of the principal 2 it governs only the relations between the principal or the agent on the one hand and the third party on the other 3 it does not govern an agents authority conferred by law or the authority of an agent appointed by a public or judicial authority article 222 establishment and scope of the authority of the agent 1 the principals grant of authority to an agent may be express or implied 2 the agent has authority to perform all acts necessary in the circumstances to achieve the purposes for which the authority was granted article 223 agency disclosed 1 where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent the acts of the agent shall directly affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party and no legal relation is created between the agent and the third party 2 however the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party where the agent with the consent of the principal undertakes to become the party to the contract annex 415 article 224 agency undisclosed 1 where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party neither knew nor ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party 2 however where such an agent when contracting with the third party on behalf of a business represents itself to be the owner of that business the third party upon discovery of the real owner of the business may exercise also against the latter the rights it has against the agent article 225 agent acting without or exceeding its authority 1 where an agent acts without authority or exceeds its authority its acts do not affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party 2 however where the principal causes the third party reasonably to believe that the agent has authority to act on behalf of the principal and that the agent is acting within the scope of that authority the principal may not invoke against the third party the lack of authority of the agent article 226 liability of agent acting without or exceeding its authority 1 an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority is failing ratification by the principal liable for damages that will place the third party in the same position as if the agent had acted with authority and not exceeded its authority 2 however the agent is not liable if the third party knew or ought to have known that the agent had no authority or was exceeding its authority article 227 conflict of interests 1 if a contract concluded by an agent involves the agent in a conflict of interests with the principal of which the third party knew or ought to have known the principal may avoid the contract the right to avoid is subject to articles 329 and 3211 to 3215 2 however the principal may not avoid the contract a if the principal had consented to or knew or ought to have known of the agents involvement in the conflict of interests or b if the agent had disclosed the conflict of interests to the principal and the latter had not objected within a reasonable time article 228 subagency an agent has implied authority to appoint a subagent to perform acts which it is not reasonable to expect the agent to perform itself the rules of this section apply to the subagency article 229 ratification 1 an act by an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority may be ratified by the principal on ratification the act produces the same effects as if it had initially been carried out with authority 2 the third party may by notice to the principal specify a reasonable period of time for ratification if the principal does not ratify within that period of time it can no longer do so unidroit principles 416 3 if at the time of the agents act the third party neither knew nor ought to have known of the lack of authority it may at any time before ratification by notice to the principal indicate its refusal to become bound by a ratification article 2210 termination of authority 1 termination of authority is not effective in relation to the third party unless the third party knew or ought to have known of it 2 notwithstanding the termination of its authority an agent remains authorised to perform the acts that are necessary to prevent harm to the principals interests chapter 3 validity section 1 general provisions article 311 matters not covered this chapter does not deal with lack of capacity article 312 validity of mere agreement a contract is concluded modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties without any further requirement article 313 initial impossibility 1 the mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract the performance of the obligation assumed was impossible does not affect the validity of the contract 2 the mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract a party was not entitled to dispose of the assets to which the contract relates does not affect the validity of the contract article 314 mandatory character of the provisions the provisions on fraud threat gross disparity and illegality contained in this chapter are mandatory section 2 grounds for avoidance article 321 definition of mistake mistake is an erroneous assumption relating to facts or to law existing when the contract was concluded article 322 relevant mistake 1 a party may only avoid the contract for mistake if when the contract was concluded the mistake was of such importance that a reasonable person in the same situation as the party in error would only have concluded the contract on materially different terms or would not have concluded it at all if the true state of affairs had been known and annex 417 a the other party made the same mistake or caused the mistake or knew or ought to have known of the mistake and it was contrary to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing to leave the mistaken party in error or b the other party had not at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the contract 2 however a party may not avoid the contract if a it was grossly negligent in committing the mistake or b the mistake relates to a matter in regard to which the risk of mistake was as sumed or having regard to the circumstances should be borne by the mistaken party article 323 error in expression or transmission an error occurring in the expression or transmission of a declaration is considered to be a mistake of the person from whom the declaration emanated article 324 remedies for nonperformance a party is not entitled to avoid the contract on the ground of mistake if the circumstances on which that party relies afford or could have afforded a remedy for nonperformance article 325 fraud a party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other partys fraudulent representation including language or practices or fraudulent nondisclosure of circumstances which according to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing the latter party should have disclosed article 326 threat a party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the other partys unjustified threat which having regard to the circumstances is so imminent and serious as to leave the first party no reasonable alternative in particular a threat is unjustified if the act or omission with which a party has been threatened is wrongful in itself or it is wrongful to use it as a means to obtain the conclusion of the contract article 327 gross disparity 1 a party may avoid the contract or an individual term of it if at the time of the conclusion of the contract the contract or term unjustifiably gave the other party an excessive advantage regard is to be had among other factors to a the fact that the other party has taken unfair advantage of the first partys dependence economic distress or

the other party declares itself willing to perform or performs the contract as it was understood by the party entitled to avoidance the contract is considered to have been concluded as the latter party understood it the other party must make such a declaration or render such performance promptly after having been informed of the manner in which the party entitled to avoidance had understood the contract and before that party has reasonably acted in reliance on a notice of avoidance 2 after such a declaration or performance the right to avoidance is lost and any earlier notice of avoidance is ineffective article 3211 notice of avoidance the right of a party to avoid the contract is exercised by notice to the other party article 3212 time limits 1 notice of avoidance shall be given within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances after the avoiding party knew or could not have been unaware of the relevant facts or became capable of acting freely 2 where an individual term of the contract may be avoided by a party under article 327 the period of time for giving notice of avoidance begins to run when that term is asserted by the other party article 3213

performance of only one party requires a period of time that party is bound to render its performance first unless the circumstances indicate otherwise article 615 earlier performance 1 the obligee may reject an earlier performance unless it has no legitimate interest in so doing 2 acceptance by a party of an earlier performance does not affect the time for the performance of its own obligations if that time has been fixed irrespective of the performance of the other partys obligations 3 additional expenses caused to the obligee by earlier performance are to be borne by the obligor without prejudice to any other remedy article 616 place of performance 1 if the place of performance is neither fixed by nor determinable from the contract a party is to perform annex 425 a a monetary

in its place of business subsequent to the conclusion of the contract article 617 payment by cheque or other instrument 1 payment may be made in any form used in the ordinary course of business at the

will be honoured article 618 payment by funds transfer 1 unless the obligee has indicated a particular account payment may be made by a transfer to any of the financial institutions in which the obligee has made it known that it has an account 2 in case of payment by a transfer the obligation of the obligor is discharged when the transfer to the obligees financial institution becomes effective article 619 currency of payment 1 if a monetary obligation is expressed in a currency other than that of the place for payment it may be paid by the obligor in the currency of the place for

is neither granted nor refused within an agreed period or where no period has been agreed within a reasonable time from the conclusion of the contract either party is entitled to terminate the contract 2 where the permission affects some terms only paragraph 1 does not apply if having regard to the circumstances it is reasonable to uphold the remaining contract even if the permission is refused article 6117 permission refused 1 the refusal of a permission affecting the validity of the contract renders the contract void if the refusal affects the validity of some terms only only such terms are void if having regard to the circumstances it is reasonable to uphold the remaining contract 2 where the refusal of a permission renders the performance of the contract impossible in whole or in part the rules on nonperformance apply annex 427 section 2 hardship article 621 contract to be observed where the performance of a contract becomes more onerous for one of the parties that party is nevertheless bound to perform its obligations subject to the following provisions on hardship article 622 definition of hardship there is hardship where the occurrence of events fundamentally alters the equilib rium of the contract either because the cost of a partys performance has increased or because the value of the performance a party receives has diminished and a the events occur or become known to the disadvantaged party after the conclu sion of the contract b the events could not reasonably have been taken into account by the disadvan taged party at the time of the conclusion of the contract c the events are beyond the control of the disadvantaged party and d the risk of the events was not assumed by the disadvantaged party article 623 effects of hardship 1 in case of hardship the disadvantaged party is entitled to request renegotia tions the request shall be made without undue delay and shall indicate the grounds on which it is based 2 the request for renegotiation does not in itself entitle the disadvantaged party to withhold performance 3 upon failure to reach agreement within a reasonable time either party may resort to the court 4 if the court finds hardship it may if reasonable a terminate the contract at a date and on terms to be fixed or b adapt the contract with a view to restoring its equilibrium chapter 7 nonperformance section 1 nonperformance in general article 711 nonperformance defined nonperformance is failure by a party to perform any of its obligations under the contract including defective performance or late

omission or by another event for which the first party bears the risk article 713 withholding performance 1 where the parties are to perform simultaneously either party may withhold performance until the other party tenders its performance unidroit principles 428 2 where the parties are to perform consecutively the party that is to perform later may withhold its performance until the first party

proposed manner and timing of the cure b cure is appropriate in the circumstances c the aggrieved party has no legitimate interest in refusing cure and d cure is effected promptly 2 the right to cure is not precluded by notice of termination 3 upon effective notice of cure rights of the aggrieved party that are inconsistent with the nonperforming partys performance are suspended until the time for cure has expired 4 the aggrieved party may withhold performance pending cure 5 notwithstanding cure the aggrieved party retains the right to claim damages for delay as well as for any harm caused or not prevented by the cure article 715 additional period for performance 1 in a case of nonperformance the aggrieved party may by notice to the other party allow an additional period of time for performance 2 during the additional period the aggrieved party may withhold performance of its own reciprocal obligations and may claim damages but may not resort to any other remedy if it receives notice from the other party that the latter will not perform within that period or if upon expiry of that period due performance has not been made the ag grieved party may resort to any of the remedies that may be available under this chapter 3 where in a case of delay in performance which is not fundamental the aggrieved party has given notice allowing an additional period of time of reasonable length it may terminate the contract at the end of that period if the additional period allowed is not of reasonable length it shall be extended to a reasonable length the aggrieved party may in its notice provide that if the other party fails to perform within the period allowed by the notice the contract shall automatically terminate 4 paragraph 3 does not apply where the obligation which has not been performed is only a minor part of the contractual obligation of the nonperforming party article 716 exemption clauses a clause which limits or excludes one partys liability for nonperformance or which permits one party to render performance substantially different from what the other party reasonably expected may not be invoked if it would be grossly unfair to do so having regard to the purpose of the contract article 717 force majeure 1 nonperformance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences annex 429 2 when the impediment is only temporary the excuse shall have effect for such period as is reasonable having regard to the effect of the impediment on the performance of the contract 3 the party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on its ability to perform if the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment it is liable for damages resulting from such non receipt 4 nothing in this article prevents a party from exercising a right to terminate the contract or to withhold performance or request interest on money due section 2 right to performance article 721 performance of monetary obligation where a party who is obliged to pay money does not do so the other party may re quire payment article 722 performance of nonmonetary obligation where a party who owes an obligation other than one to pay money does not per form the other party may require performance unless a performance is impossible in law or in fact b performance or where relevant enforcement is unreasonably burdensome or expensive c the party entitled to performance may reasonably obtain performance from an other source d performance is of an exclusively personal character or e the party entitled to performance does not require performance within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become aware of the nonperformance article 723 repair and replacement of defective performance the right to performance includes in appropriate cases the right to require repair replacement or other cure of defective performance the provisions of articles 721 and 722 apply accordingly article 724 judicial penalty 1 where the court orders a party to perform it may also direct that this party pay a penalty if it does not comply with the order 2 the penalty shall be paid to the aggrieved party unless mandatory provisions of the law of the forum provide otherwise payment of the penalty to the aggrieved party does not exclude any claim for damages article 725 change of remedy 1 an aggrieved party who has required performance of a nonmonetary obliga tion and who has not received performance within a period fixed or otherwise within a reasonable period of time may invoke any other remedy 2 where the decision of a court for performance of a nonmonetary obligation cannot be enforced the aggrieved party may invoke any other remedy unidroit principles 430 section 3 termination article 731 right to terminate the contract 1 a party may terminate the contract where the failure of the other party to perform an obligation under the contract amounts to a fundamental nonperformance 2 in determining whether a failure to perform an obligation amounts to a funda mental nonperformance regard shall be had in particular to whether a the nonperformance substantially deprives the aggrieved party of what it was entitled to expect under the contract unless the other party did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen such result b strict compliance with the obligation which has not been performed is of essence under the contract c the nonperformance is intentional or reckless d the nonperformance gives the aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot rely on the other partys future performance e the nonperforming party will suffer disproportionate loss as a result of the preparation or performance if the contract is terminated 3 in the case of delay the aggrieved party may also terminate the contract if the other party fails to perform before the time allowed it under article 715 has expired article 732 notice of termination 1 the right of a party to terminate the contract is exercised by notice to the other party 2 if performance has been offered late or otherwise does not conform to the contract the aggrieved party will lose its right to terminate the contract unless it gives notice to the other party within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become aware of the offer or of the nonconforming performance article 733 anticipatory nonperformance where prior to the date for performance by one of the parties it is clear that there will be a fundamental nonperformance by that party the other party may terminate the contract article 734 adequate assurance of due performance a party who reasonably believes that there will be a fundamental nonperformance by the other party may demand adequate assurance of due performance and may meanwhile withhold its own performance where this assurance is not provided within a reasonable time the party demanding it may terminate the contract article 735 effects of termination in general 1 termination of the contract releases both parties from their obligation to effect and to receive future performance 2 termination does not preclude a claim for damages for nonperformance 3 termination does not affect any provision in the contract for the settlement of disputes or any other term of the contract which is to operate even after termination annex 431 article 736 restitution with respect to contracts to be performed at one time 1 on termination of a contract to be performed at one time either party may claim restitution of whatever it has supplied under the contract provided that such party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received under the contract 2 if restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate an allowance has to be made in money whenever reasonable 3 the recipient of the performance does not have to make an allowance in money if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attributable to the other party 4 compensation may be claimed for expenses reasonably required to preserve or maintain the performance received article 737 restitution with respect to longterm contracts 1 on termination of a longterm contract restitution can only be claimed for the period after termination has taken effect provided the contract is divisible 2 as far as restitution has to be made the provisions of article 736 apply section 4 damages article 741 right to damages any nonperformance gives the aggrieved party a right to damages either exclusively or in conjunction with any other remedies except where the non performance is excused under these principles article 742 full compensation 1 the aggrieved party is entitled to full compensation for harm sustained as a result of the nonperformance such harm includes both any loss which it suffered and any gain of which it was deprived taking into account any gain to the aggrieved party resulting from its avoidance of cost or harm 2 such harm may be nonpecuniary and includes for instance physical suffering or emotional distress article 743 certainty of harm 1 compensation is due only for harm including future harm that is established with a reasonable degree of certainty 2 compensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence 3 where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty the assessment is at the discretion of the court article 744 foreseeability of harm the nonperforming party is liable only for harm which it foresaw or could reasonably have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract as being likely to result from its nonperformance unidroit principles 432 article 745 proof of harm in case of replacement transaction where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has made a replacement transaction within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner it may recover the difference between the contract price and the price of the replacement transaction as well as damages for any further harm article 746 proof of harm by current price 1 where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has not made a replacement transaction but there is a current price for the performance contracted for it may recover the difference between the contract price and the price current at the time the contract is terminated as well as damages for any further harm 2 current price is the price generally charged for goods delivered or services rendered in comparable circumstances at the place where the contract should have been performed or if there is no current price at that place the current price at such other place that appears reasonable to take as a reference article 747 harm due in part to aggrieved party where the harm is due in part to an act or omission of the aggrieved party or to an other event for which that party bears the risk the amount of damages shall be reduced to the extent that these factors have contributed to the harm having regard to the conduct of each of the parties article 748 mitigation of harm 1 the nonperforming party is not liable for harm suffered by the aggrieved party to the extent that the harm could have been reduced by the latter partys taking reasonable steps 2 the aggrieved party is entitled to recover any expenses reasonably incurred in attempting to reduce the harm article 749 interest for failure to pay money 1 if a party does not pay a sum of money when it falls due the aggrieved party is entitled to interest upon that sum from the time when payment is due to the time of payment whether or not the nonpayment is excused 2 the rate of interest shall be the average bank shortterm lending rate to prime borrowers prevailing for the currency of payment at the place for payment or where no such rate exists at that place then the same rate in the state of the currency of payment in the absence of such a rate at either place the rate of interest shall be the appropriate rate fixed by the law of the state of the currency of payment 3 the aggrieved party is entitled to additional damages if the nonpayment caused it a greater harm article 7410 interest on damages unless otherwise agreed interest on damages for nonperformance of nonmonetary obligations accrues as from the time of nonperformance annex 433 article 7411 manner of monetary redress 1 damages are to be paid in a lump sum however they may be payable in instalments where the nature of the harm makes this appropriate 2 damages to be paid in instalments may be indexed article 7412 currency in which to assess damages damages are to be assessed either in the currency in which the monetary obligation was expressed or in the currency in which the harm was suffered whichever is more appropriate article 7413 agreed payment for nonperformance 1 where the contract provides that a party who does not perform is to pay a specified sum to the aggrieved party for such nonperformance the aggrieved party is entitled to that sum irrespective of its actual harm 2 however notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary the specified sum may be reduced to a reasonable amount where it is grossly excessive in relation to the harm resulting from the nonperformance and to the other circumstances chapter 8 setoff article 81 conditions of setoff 1 where two parties owe each other money or other performances of the same kind either of them the first party may set off its obligation against that of its obligee the other party if at the time of setoff a the first party is entitled to perform its obligation b the other partys
