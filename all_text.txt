why a licensing policy 12 patents represent an important investment notably financially for companies and are considered as intangible asset that are of importance in evaluating the value and strength of a company furthermore generally speaking less than 10 of a patent portfolio contribute towards revenues of a company thus there is a need to find returns on investments roi opportunities reasons

guidelines are intended to cover the review of contracts proposed by counterparties and the review of amendments to manes agreement proposals that are made by counterparties manes organization and reference numbers we must ensure that mane confidentiality policy and its faq are strictly complied with in the us administration of cdas is centralized which includes registration by peggi ridner sales assistant at minc back up peggie schenke by stacy stoll at musa back up debbie pannuto for kancor mita is taking care of it until kancor employees are provided access rights to sharepoint for the rest of the group the mane contract manager mane employee requesting the cda issuance or review is responsible for administrating and we do not do it confirm the mane contract manager has properly designated the cda as one of the four types identified below bi bilateral for the protection of both parties u unilateral for manes protection only ud unilateral formula disclosure this form is required when mane will disclose formulae oth unilateral for the counterpartys protection only confirm the mane contract manager registered the cda and added the reference id to the footer reviews of cda proposals to mane for negotiation purposes in bold essential in grey not essential identify the parties to the contract using full legal registered names jurisdiction and address are useful but not essential need to check which mane entity isare involved in the disclosure and receipt of confidential information define the subject matter or purpose correspond with the mane contract manager if it is unclear and the mane contract manager did not properly define it in the register entry broader language gives the parties more flexibility and avoids the possibility of the parties disclosing ci that would not be covered under narrower subject matter narrower language provides more control over the ci flow and avoids ambiguity about the scope of the cda as a rule subject matter purpose must be specified and detailed as much as possible with customers or prospects make sure it is connected to business with mane supply of products by mane ie that mane ci cannot be used by counterparty for another purpose than within the framework of business relationship with mane specify an effective date or state that the cda becomes effective on the date of last signature define confidential information if mane is disclosing bi u ud it should include formulae specifications manufacturing process data sample materials knowhow and documentation and business information legitimately regarded as proprietary define the discloser or disclosing party to apply to both mane and the counterparty bi if it is not the case in the counterparty proposal and if mane contract manager confirms mane has ci to cover if mane contract manager declares in writing that mane has no ci to cover and will not disclose ci under the cda the cda will remain an oth and it will need to be reminded in writing internally that no ci can be disclosed under the cda specify that ci does not need to be identified as confidential or refuse such a statement if mentioned bi u ud we try to avoid requiring that our ci be designated to qualify for protection but we can accept if the counterparty requires it in such case we must alert the mane contract manager to this requirement note if mane turns over ci but fails to designate it as confidential despite the cda requiring it then the ci is not protected under the cda or any document accordingly mane will have disclosed ci without using reasonable means to ensure it is kept secret a fundamental precept of us trade secret law so even if the counterparty still treats the ci as confidential mane has arguably lost the right to claim protection of it including as to third parties because we will have put the ci in the hands of another party without protections in place if mane wants the right to share the counterparties ci with mane affiliates then add such right and define affiliates by using the definition in manes standard forms bi oth control must exceed 50 refuse sharing of ci with agents consultants advisors or representatives in the majority of cases the counterparty reserves the right to share with these external third parties we strike arguing that 1 the counterparty doesnt really need to share manes ci with them 2 mane loses visibility on who has its ci and 3 mane effectively loses control over the ci because we lack privity of contract with the third party in some cases mane can accept to extend the right to sharing with external consultants although we should require an explanation as to precisely why it is needed but we would require to add 1 that the counterparty first submit the names of the consultant and obtain manes approval 2 that the counterparty remains fully obligated toward mane for any failure of the consultant to observe the restrictions alternatively mane might require to sign a separate cda with the consultant observe the different forms that agents can be engaged 1 counterpartys agents permitted to share counterpartys ci directly with mane 2 counterparty reserves right to share ci of agents or even third parties or 3 counterparty reserves right to share mane ci with counterpartys agents these three are listed roughly in increasing order of risk to mane for situation 1 we try to avoid and can usually accept if the counterparty pushes although we then require that the agent designate the ci as confidential and property of counterparty in order for it to qualify for protection under the cda we also specify that the counterparty remains liable for its agents actions or omissions that violate the cda for situation 2 it seems it should not usually be valid for the counterparty to claim a need to share third party ci consider especially that if the third party acted responsibly in relation to its ci it established confidentiality commitments with manes counterparty and the counterparty might be violating such obligations by sharing with mane a situation we dont want to be embroiled in for situation 3 the comments above apply we generally reject the counterpartys right to share mane ci outside the company but may be able to accept upon restrictive conditions specify the confidentiality obligations hold in confidence restrict access to employees and affiliates who need to know for the purpose of the subject matter prevent disclosure to third parties use ci only for the purpose of the subject matter use same standard of care as used for own ci but no less than reasonable standard no copying or reproducing ci except as necessary to effectuate the purpose of the subject matter include a nonanalysis clause proscribing reverse engineering of manes samples by the counterparty or any other party at the counterpartys direction we should always insist on this in rare cases counterparties have refused and then we can probably withdraw provided the mane team is given very strict instructions that they may not provide sample materials some counterparties require a separate material transfer agreement to protect sample materials mane is content with our standard cda although we do have an mta form if the counterparty will reject the full cda assuming the counterparty will only be receiving samples and no other forms of ci specify the obligations survive either termination or expiration of the cda many counterparties refuse indefinite survival of obligations manes response depends on the particular circumstances we can argue for survival because the obligations are negative ie neither party has a continuing obligation to do anything rather they must only not misappropriate or further disclose ci considering that in practice parties usually do not formally return or destroy ci belonging to the other party we want to avoid anyone else having possession of mane ci with restrictions expiring at the conclusion of some arbitrary survival period we can argue further that if we grant them the exception ie the obligations will expire after a defined survival period then mane loses confidentiality protection on any ci still in the counterpartys possession not just as to the counterparty but as to the world on the theory that we cannot effectively oblige someone else to treat our information as confidential if we have tacitly allowed a third party to have it without restriction this being said since indefinite obligations might also be terminated which could lead to mane being less protected than with a limited survival of obligations we can accept to limit the survival if we withdraw from the indefinite survival position we try for a longer period of perhaps 10 or 20 years depending on the sensitivity of the ci to be disclosed for cda ud we should not accept less than 20 years this issue in particular underscores the value of discretion ie manes employees should not treat a cda as an opportunity to freely discuss and share anything and everything rather mane should still be thoughtful about disclosing only what is really necessary to further a discussion or relationship define the exceptions to ci obligations ci is already in the receiving partys unrestricted possession ie without obligations we can accept if the counterparty includes as proven by documentary evidence ci is publicly available ci later becomes publicly available ci is received on nonconfidential basis by third party who has bona fide right to disclose we can accept if the counterparty includes as proven by documentary evidence ci is independently developed by the party its employees agents or representatives who have not used or relied upon the ci we can accept if the counterparty includes as proven by documentary evidence some counterparties specify who have not had access to the ci mane has used this in its own forms in the past it is acceptable but i think better to avoid because usually mane is the party performing the rd and this could theoretically restrict manes work insofar as the same individual that independently develops certain ci may also be the same person that has had access to or come into contact with the ci of the counterparty of course the aim is not to try to misappropriate anyone elses work but this exception clause does not permit that anyway ci that is required to be disclosed by judicial order requirement of governmental agency or by operation of law in respect of this compulsory disclosure exception be mindful that if the counterparty frames these exceptions as outside the definition of confidential information rather than exceptions to the confidentiality obligations a correction should be made either by specifying the exceptions apply to the obligations or by setting off this particular exception it is a subtle point and important to recognize that simply because a court or agency requires that the counterparty turn over certain mane ci it does not convert mane ci to nonconfidential rather the counterparty is simply excused from the confidentiality obligations to allow it to comply with the order state that ci remains the disclosers property state that no license or other ip right is granted or implied refuse any direct or indirect reference to an assignment of manes ip rights this includes statements that information derived from ci must be considered as confidential make sure the ci is the information disclosed by a party to the other party nothing else require return or destruction of ci upon written request we try to avoid having this obligation occur automatically upon an event eg end of need for ci expiration termination because that would require that mane track this requirement and we dont have the systems to control for this so if we fail to observe the commitment then mane would be in breach better to require that the owner make a written request it remains entirely within their discretion to receive the ci back and protects us from violating the cda inadvertently we generally want to avoid retention of a copy of ci but we can likely accept provided it is specified that the copy may be kept only by legal counsel strictly for the purpose of determining continuing obligations ie if mane would accuse a counterparty of misappropriating its ci the counterparty wants to ensure it actually has a copy of the source ci that is the subject of the controversy in order to be able to properly defend itself the following shall be added in case the counterparty insists return and destruction of ci all proprietary information shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be destroyed andor returned by the receiving party to the disclosing party upon written request of the disclosing party and the same shall be confirmed by the receiving party in writing to the disclosing party state that no assignment of the cda is permitted without the consent of the other party state that the cda does not imply any promise to transact business state that disclosure is at the discretion of the disclosing party state that failure to insist upon strict compliance does not constitute a waiver state that no amendment is permitted without mutual written agreement state that if a provision is held invalid or unenforceable the other provisions are not affected and only the offending provision is excluded some counterparties instead state that the offending provision is to be construed to most closely approximate the parties intent while taking a legally valid form this seems fine as an alternative state that the cda constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes previous agreements if not already known it is useful to check the register to confirm there arent any prior cdas in some cases we may need to state that the new cda does not affect a certain cda that is meant to continue specify governing law and exclusive jurisdiction for resolution of disputes us 1 ohio hamilton county 2 new york southern district of new york 3 delaware no to california europe 1 france 2 switzerland geneva asia 1 france 2 hong kong 3 singapore generally we try to avoid mandatory arbitration specify the term often three years from effective date but if no term will be stated then it is probably prudent to assert the respective parties right to terminate the agreement upon 30 or 60 days written notice identify the representatives and their titles for notices and correspondence we dont always insist upon adding this but it can be useful the register nevertheless requires that an individual be nominated require that the counterparty execute two originals so that each party may receive its own original hard copy avoid language that specifies a facsimile or electronic copy qualifies as an original provided we make it clear to the counterparty that we nevertheless require to receive a hard copy original the parties should have authorized representatives execute theoretically a counterparty might be able to avoid a contract if it can successfully claim that an unauthorized employee entered into a commitment nevertheless it is helpful to keep in mind that we should be looking for individuals with appropriate titles as the signatories when french laws are applicable in case of doubt on the capacity of the signatory to sign the contract in the name and on behalf of the company the following is to be sent in an email to the counterparty by mane contract manager thank you for confirming that mrmrs in hisher quality of is entitled to sign the contract for and on behalf of the companybefore the refuse joint and codevelopment language in cdas if the counterparty objects argue it is beyond the scope of the cda also it is generally not the case and usually not to manes advantage refuse any mention of exclusivity exclusivity in supply is entirely outside the scope of the cda mane formulas disclosures if mane will be disclosing formulaes it should only be for a toxicological safety or regulatory compliance purpose and manes ud template must be used the individuals to be limited in number and usually restricted to the regulatory and quality departments at the counterparty who will have access to manes formulae must sign the cda personally arguments for personal commitments of counterpartys employees it is manes global corporate policy and has been in place for many years 2009 it is required if mane is obliged to share formulae for flavors mane is a member of iofi and adheres to its code of practice 632 specifies that iofi members should require personal commitments formulae are among manes most sensitive ci so it is necessary to use very strict controls to guard against possible misappropriation which would not simply dilute the value but end it mane invests considerable resources in rd so our counterparties need to respect the measures we must take to protect manes developments the counterpartys internal confidentiality policies and the deontology of regulatory ips do not provide any remedy to mane against breach of the secrecy of formulae the responsibility of the counterpartys employees does not change they would be obliged to observe the confidentiality obligations regardless of their signature the personal commitment simply allows mane to have a recourse directly against the particular individual the personal commitment is especially important because it protects mane when the individual changes employers also if the individual is instructed by his employer our counterparty to act in a way that would violate the cda he or she would be personally accountable toward mane for such breach we do not accept if the counterparty invokes labor law to refuse personal commitments it is without merit regarding manes need to be protected directly manes own employees are sometimes required to commit personally transparency some major market players relies on the transparency trend initiated notably by consumers to ask for full formula disclosure without any limitation to toxicological safety and regulatory compliance evaluation purposes since their aim is to disclose some information about the formula to the final consumer our cda templates were not adequate therefore we have introduced a new cda template for transparency matters tr which covers the disclosure of the qualitative formula quantities are not disclosed such template is only available to legal ip department and might only be used for major perfumery clients and as an exception with the prior approval of the region director ie mmm for americas sma for emea bjl for asia using such tr template is imperative for any transparency requests from a customer proposed clause for material transfer agreement when mane is providing samples and the counterpart requires the sample to be blend in its product to test the product performance the following to be added xxx shall not itself or through a third party reverse engineer or reproduce proprietary material in order to determine the chemical structure composition or manufacturing process without the prior written consent of mane xxx can only use the samples for testing its performance and applicability as a component of one of xxxs products any other use requires the prior written consent of manemane group code of conduct personal data protection 1 purpose of the code

products fragrances flavours ingredients within a limited territory country region city for a specific market fragrance flavour for the food cosmetic personal care home care and less frequently in fine fragrance pharmaceutical tobacco pet food and oral care industries and grow manes direct sales accordingly a mane distributor is appointed to resell as is some of manes products fragrances flavours ingredients within a limited territory country region city for a specific market fragrance flavour for the food cosmetic personal care home care and less frequently in fine fragrance pharmaceutical tobacco pet food and oral care industries to its own customers what is the difference between a commercial representative and an agent an agent is entitled to negotiate selling prices on behalf of the company it represents while a commercial representative is not mane does not appoint agents only commercial representatives does commercial representative or distributor have to meet any sales target yes necessarily if it is appointed on an exclusive basis can we pay a commission to a distributor no a distributor makes profit out of its own sales as opposed to a commercial representative which receives a commissionbased compensation from mane for its services what does it mean granting exclusivity to a distributor or a commercial representative it prevents mane from appointing any other distributor or commercial representative of the products in the territory in the market can mane determine the selling price of mane products from a distributor no distributor must remain free to establish its prices and discounts for the products and related services with the goal of maximizing the competitiveness of the products and preserving the reputation of mane at mane request the distributor will inform mane about these prices and discounts and any planned change thereof can we conclude a single agreement covering both flavour and fragrance segment for the same commercial representative or distributor it is always advisable to have two agreements for two different segments flavour and fragrance for the same commercial representative or distributor this gives the advantage of termination rights to mane if commercial representative or the distributor is unable to meet the sales target for flavour but achieve the target for fragrance then mane can terminate the flavour agreement only and retain the fragrance agreement why do we need to exclude certain customers from the scope of commercial representation or distribution agreement the customers excluded from the scope of a commercial representation or distribution agreement are mane reserved customers who pursue their existing business relationships directly with mane without compensation for a commercial representative and cannot be considered distributors own customers the list of such excludedreserved customers should be reviewedupdated by mane and the commercial representative or distributor at the end of each calendar year and modified as the case maybe through an amendment to the agreement can a commercial representative distributor use manes trademark commercial representative cannot use mane trademark without manes prior written approval distributor has no rights connected with mane trademark other than those which are strictly necessary to the marketing and sale of the products can a commercial representative distributor further subcontract no subcontracting is excluded what information do we need to provide to legal ip department after you determine the

incoterms 2020 rules do and do not do and how they are best incorporated to set out the important fundamentals of the incoterms rules the basic roles and responsibilities of seller and buyer delivery risk and the relationship between the incoterms rules and the contracts surrounding a typical contract of sale for exportimport and also where appropriate for domestic sales to explain how best to choose the right incoterms rule for the particular sale contract and to set out the central changes between incoterms 2010 and incoterms 2020 2 the introduction follows this structure i what the incoterms rules do ii what the incoterms rules do not do iii how best to incorporate the incoterms rules iv delivery risk and costs in the incoterms 2020 rules v incoterms 2020 rules and the carrier vi rules for the contract of sale and their relationship to other contracts vii the eleven incoterms 2020 rulessea and inland waterway and any modes of transport getting it right viii order within the incoterms 2020 rules ix differences between incoterms 2010 and incoterms 2020 x caution with variants of incoterms rules 3 this introduction gives guidance on the use of and about the fundamental principles behind the incoterms 2020 rules incoterms 2020 2u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc i what the incoterms rules do 4 the incoterms rules explain a set of eleven of the most commonlyused threeletter trade terms eg cif dap etc reflecting businesstobusiness practice in contracts for the sale and purchase of goods 5 the incoterms rules describe obligations who does what as between seller and buyer eg who organises carriage or insurance of the goods or who obtains shipping documents and export or importxa0licences risk where and when the seller delivers the goods in other words where risk transfers from seller to buyer and costs which party is responsible for which costs for example transport packaging loading or unloading costs and checking or securityrelated costs the incoterms rules cover these areas in a set of ten articles numbered a1b1 etc the a articles representing the sellers obligations and the b articles representing the buyers obliga tions see paragraph 53 below ii what the incoterms rules do not do 6 the incoterms rules are not in themselvesand are therefore no substitute fora contract of sale they are devised to reflect trade practice for no particular type of goodsand for any they can be used as much for the trading of a bulk cargo of iron ore as for five containers of electronic equipment or ten pallets of airfreighted fresh flowers 7 the incoterms rules do not deal with the following matters whether there is a contract of sale at all the specifications of the goods sold the time place method or currency of payment of the price the remedies which can be sought for breach of the contract ofxa0sale most consequences of delay and other breaches in the performance of contractual obligations the effect of sanctions the imposition of tariffs export or import prohibitions force majeure or hardship intellectual property rights or the method venue or law of dispute resolution in case of such breach incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20023 perhaps most importantly it must be stressed that the incoterms rules do not deal with the transfer of property titleownership of the goods sold 8 these are matters for which the parties need to make specific provision in their contract of sale failure to do so is likely to cause problems later if disputes arise about performance and breach in essence the incoterms 2020 rules are not themselves a contract of sale they only become part of that contract when they are incorporated into a contract which already exists neither do the incoterms rules provide the law applicable to the contract there may be legal regimes which apply to the contract whether international like the conven tion on the international sale of goods cisg or domestic mandatory law relating for example to health and safety or the environment iii how best to incorporate the incoterms rules 9 if parties want the incoterms 2020 rules to apply to their contract the safest way to ensure this is to make that intention clear in their contract through words such as the chosen incoterms rule named port place or point incoterms 2020 10 thus for example cif shanghai incoterms 2020 or dap no 123 abc street importland incoterms 2020 11 leaving the year out could cause problems that may be difficult to resolve the parties a judge or an arbitrator need to be able to determine which version of the incoterms rules applies to the contract 12 the place named next to the chosen incoterms rule is even more important in all incoterms rules except the c rules the named place indicates where the goods are delivered ie where risk transfers from seller to buyer in the d rules the named place is the place of delivery and also the place of destination and the seller must organise carriage to that point in the c rules the named place indicates the destination to which the seller must organise and pay for the carriage of the goods which is not however the place or port of delivery 13 thus an fob sale raising doubt about the port of shipment leaves both parties uncertain as to where the buyer must present the ship to the seller for the shipment and the trans port of the goodsand as to where the seller must deliver the goods on board so as to transfer risk in the goods from seller to buyer again a cpt contract with an unclear named incoterms 2020 4u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc destination will leave both parties in doubt as to the point to which the seller must contract and pay for the transport of the goods 14 it is best to avoid these types of issues by being as geographi cally specific as possible in naming the port place or point as the case may be in the chosen incoterms rule 15 when incorporating a particular incoterms 2020 rule into a sale contract it is not necessary to use the trademark symbol for further guidance on trademark and copyright please refer to httpsiccwboorgincotermscopyright iv delivery risk and costs in the incotermsxa02020xa0rules 16 a named place or port attached to the three letters eg cip las vegas or cif los angeles then is critical in the workings of the incoterms 2020 rules depending on which incoterms 2020 rule is chosen that place will identify either the place or port at which the goods are considered to have been delivered by the seller to the buyer the place of delivery or the place or port to which the seller must organise the carriage of the goods ie their destination or in the case of the d rulesxa0both 17 in all incoterms 2020 rules a2 will define the place or port of deliveryand that place or port is closest to the seller in exw and fca sellers premises and closest to the buyer in dap dpu and ddp 18 the place or port of delivery identified by a2 is critical both for risk and for costs 19 the place or port of delivery under a2 marks the place at which risk transfers from seller to buyer under a3 it is at that place or port that the seller performs its obligation to provide the goods under the contract as reflected in a1 such that the buyer cannot recover against the seller for the loss of or damage to the goods occurring after that point has passed 20 the place or port of delivery under a2 also marks the central point under a9 which allocates costs to seller and buyer in broad terms a9 allocates costs before the point of delivery to the seller and costs after that point to the buyer delivery points extremes and inbetweens the four traditional incoterms rules groups 21 versions of the incoterms rules before 2010 traditionally grouped the rules into four namely e f c and d with e and d lying at extreme poles from each other in terms of the point of delivery and the f and c rules lying in between while the incoterms rules have since 2010 been grouped according incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20025 to the means of transport used the old groupings are still helpful in understanding the point of delivery thus the delivery point in exw is an agreed point for collection of the goods by the buyer whatever the destination to which the buyer will take them at the other extreme in dap dpu and ddp the delivery point is the same as the destination point to which the seller or its carrier will carry the goods in the first exw risk transfers before the transport cycle even starts in the second the d rules risk transfers very late in that cycle again in the first exw and for that matter fca sellers premises the seller performs its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not they actually arrive at their destination in the second the seller performs its obligation to deliver the goods only if they actually arrive at their destination 22 the two rules at the extreme ends of the incoterms rules are exw and ddp however traders should consider alternative rules to these two for their international contracts thus with exw the seller has to merely put the goods at the buyers disposal this may cause problems for the seller and the buyer respectively with loading and export clearance the seller would be better advised to sell under the fca rule likewise with ddp the seller owes some obligations to the buyer which can only be performed within the buyers country for example obtaining import clearance it may be physically or legally difficult for the seller to carry out those obligations within the buyers country and a seller would therefore be better advised to consider selling goods in such circumstances under the dap or dpu rules 23 between the two extremes of e and d rules there lie the three f rules fca fas and fob and the four c rules cpt cip cfr and cif 24 with all seven f and c rules the place of delivery is on the sellers side of the anticipated carriage consequently sales using these incoterms rules are often called shipment sales delivery occurs for example a when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the port of loading in cfr cif and fob or b by handing the goods over to the carrier in cpt and cip or c by loading them on the means of transport provided by the buyer or placing them at the disposal of the buyers carrier inxa0fca in the f and c groups risk transfers at the sellers end of the main carriage such that the seller will have performed its obligation to deliver the goods whether or not the goods actually arrive at their destination this feature of being shipment sales with delivery happening at the sellers end early incoterms 2020 6u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc in the transit cycle is common to the f and the c rules whether they are the maritime incoterms rules or the incoterms rules intended for any modes of transport 25 the f and the c rules do however differ as to whether it is the seller or buyer who contracts for or arranges the carriage of the goods beyond the place or port of delivery in the f rules itxa0is the buyer who makes such arrangements unless the parties agree otherwise in the c rules this obligation falls to the seller 26 given that a seller on any of the c rules contracts for or arranges the carriage of the goods beyond delivery the parties need to know what the destination is to which it must arrange carriageand that is the place attached to the name of the incoterms rule eg cif the port of dalian or cip the inland city of shenyang whatever that named destination is that place is not and never becomes the place of delivery risk will have transferred on shipment or on handing over the goods at the place of delivery but the contract of carriage must have been made by the seller for the named destination delivery and destination then in the c rules are necessarily not the same place v incoterms 2020 rules and the carrier 27 in the f and the c rules placing the goods for example on board the vessel or handing them over to or placing them at the disposal of the carrier marks the point at which the goods are delivered by the seller to the buyer therefore this is the point at which risk transfers from the seller to the buyer 28 given those two important consequences it becomes essential to identify who the carrier is where there is more than one carrier each carrying out a separate leg of transport for instance by road rail air or sea of course where the seller has taken the far more prudent course of making one contract of carriage with one carrier taking responsibility for the entire carriage chain in a socalled through contract of carriage the problem does not arise however where there is no such through carriage contract the goods could be handed over where the cip or cpt rules are used to a roadhaulier or rail company for onward transmission to a sea carrier the same situation may arise with exclusively maritime transport where for example the goods are first handed over to a river or feeder shortsea carrier for onward transmission to an oceanxa0carrier 29 in these situations when does the seller deliver the goods to the buyer when it hands the goods over to the first second or third carrier 30 before we answer that question a preliminary point while in most cases the carrier will be an independent third party engaged under a contract of carriage by either the seller or the incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20027 buyer depending on whether the parties have chosen a c incoterms rule or an f incoterms rule there are situations where no such independent third party is engaged at all because the seller or the buyer itself will carry the goods sold this is more likely to happen in the d rules dap dpu and ddp where the seller may use its own means of transport to carry the goods to the buyer at the delivery destination provision has therefore been made in the incoterms 2020 rules for a seller under the d rules either to contract for carriage or to arrange for carriage that is to say through its own means of transport see a4 31 the question asked at paragraph 29 above is not simply a carriage question it is an important sale question the question is not which carrier can a seller or buyer of goods damaged in transit sue under the contract of carriage the sale question is where there is more than one carrier involved in the carriage of the goods from seller to buyer at which point in the carriage string does the handing over of the goods mark the point of delivery and the transfer of risk as between seller and buyer 32 there needs to be a simple answer to this question because the relationships between the multiple carriers used and between the seller andor the buyer with those several carriers will be complex depending as they do on the terms of a number of separate contracts of carriage thus for example in any such chain of contracts of carriage one carrier such as a carrier actually performing a leg of the transit by road may well act as the sellers agent in concluding a contract of carriage with a carrier by sea 33 the incoterms 2020 rules give a clear answer to this question where the parties contract on fca in fca the relevant carrier is the carrier nominated by the buyer to whom the seller hands over the goods at the place or point agreed in the contract of sale thus even if a seller engages a road haulier to take the goods to the agreed delivery point risk would transfer not at the place and time where the seller hands the goods over to the haulier engaged by the seller but at the place and time where the goods are placed at the disposal of the carrier engaged by the buyer this is why the naming of the place or point of delivery as precisely as possible is so important in fca sales the same situation can arise in fob if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the vessel engaged by the buyer a similar answer is provided by incoterms 2020 delivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the buyers carrier 34 with the c rules the position is more complex and may well attract different solutions under different legal systems in cpt and cip the relevant carrier is likely to be regarded at any rate in some jurisdictions as the first carrier to whom the seller incoterms 2020 8u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc hands over the goods under a2 unless the parties have agreed on the point of delivery the buyer knows nothing of the contractual arrangements made between the seller and the first or subsequent carriers or indeed between that first carrier and subsequent carriers what the buyer does know however is that the goods are in transit to him or herand that transit starts as far as the buyer knows when the goods are put by the seller into the hands of the first carrier the conse quence is that risk transfers from seller to buyer at that early stage of delivery to the first carrier the same situation can arise in cfr and cif if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the agreed port of shipment if any a similar answer might be suggested in some legal systems delivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the agreed port of shipment if any 35 such a conclusion if adopted may seem harsh on the buyer risk would transfer from seller to buyer in cpt and cip sales when the goods are handed over to the first carrier the buyer does not know at that stage whether or not that first carrier is responsible for loss of or damage to the goods under the relevant carriage contract the buyer is not a party to that contract has no control over it and will not know its terms yet despite this the buyer would end up bearing the risk in the goods from the very earliest moment of handing over possibly without recovery against that first carrier 36 while the buyer would end up bearing the risk of loss of or damage to the goods at an early stage of the transport chain it would on this view however have a remedy against the seller a2a3 do not operate in a vacuum under a4 the seller must contract for the carriage of the goods from the agreed point of delivery if any at the place of delivery to the named place of destination or if agreed any point at that place even if risk has transferred to the buyer at the time the goods were handed over to the first carrier under a2a3 if that first carrier does not undertake responsibility under its contract of carriage for the through carriage of the goods to the named destina tion the seller on this view would remain liable to the buyer under a4 in essence the seller should make a contract of carriage to the destination named under the contract of sale vi rules for the contract of sale and their relationship to other contracts 37 this discussion of the role of the carrier in the delivery of the goods as between the seller and the buyer in the c and f incoterms rules raises the question what role do the incoterms rules play in the contract of carriage or indeed in any of the other contracts typically surrounding an export contract for example an insurance contract or a letter ofxa0credit incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u20029 38 the short answer is that the incoterms rules do not form part of those other contracts where incorporated the incoterms rules apply to and govern only certain aspects of the contract of sale 39 this is not the same as saying however that the incoterms rules have no impact on those other contracts goods are exported and imported through a network of contracts that in an ideal world should match the one with the other thus the sale contract for example will require the tender of a transport document issued by the carrier to the sellershipper under a contract of carriage and against which the seller shipperbeneficiary might wish to be paid under a letter of credit where the three contracts match things go well where they do not problems rapidly arise 40 what the incoterms rules say for example about carriage or transport documents in a4b4 and a6b6 or what they say about insurance cover a5b5 does not bind the carrier or the insurer or any of the banks involved thus a carrier is only bound to issue a transport document as required by the contract of carriage it makes with the other party to that contract it is not bound to issue a transport document com plying with the incoterms rules likewise an insurer is bound to issue a policy to the level and in the terms agreed with the party purchasing the insurance not a policy which complies with the incoterms rules finally a bank will look only at the documentary requirements in the letter of credit if any not at the requirements of the sales contract 41 however it is very much in the interests of all the parties to the different contracts in the network to ensure that the carriage or insurance terms they have agreed with the carrier or insurer or the terms of a letter of credit comply with what the sale contract says about ancillary contracts that need to be made or documents that need to be obtained and tendered that task does not fall on the carrier the insurer or the bank none of whom are party to the contract of sale and none of whom are therefore party to or bound by the incoterms 2020 rules it is however in the sellers and buyers interest to try to ensure that the different parts of the network of contracts matchand the starting point is the sale contractand therefore where they apply the incoterms 2020 rules vii the eleven incoterms 2020 rulessea and inland waterway and any modes of transport getting it right 42 the main distinction introduced in the incoterms 2010 rules that between rules for any mode or modes of transport comprising exw fca cpt cip dap the newly named incoterms 2020 10u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc dputhe old datand ddp and rules for sea and inland waterway transport comprising fas fob cfr and cif has been retained 43 the four socalled maritime incoterms rules are intended for use where the seller places the goods on board or in fas alongside a vessel at a sea or river port it is at this point that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer when these rules are used the risk of loss of or damage to those goods is on the buyers shoulders from that port 44 the seven incoterms rules for any mode or modes of transport socalled multimodal on the other hand are intended for use where a the point at which the seller hands the goods over to or places them at the disposal of a carrier or b the point at which the carrier hands the goods over to the buyer or the point at which they are placed at the disposal of the buyer or c both points a and b are not on board or in fas alongside a vessel 45 where delivery happens and risk transfers in each of these seven incoterms rules will depend on which particular rule is used for example in cpt delivery happens at the sellers end when the goods are handed over to the carrier contracted by the seller in dap on the other hand delivery happens when the goods are placed at the buyers disposal at the named place or point of destination 46 the order in which the incoterms 2010 rules were presented has as we have said been largely retained in incoterms 2020 and it is important to underline the distinction between the two families of incoterms rules so that the right rule is used for the contract of sale depending on the means of transport used 47 one of the most frequent problems in the use of the incoterms rules is the choice of the wrong rule for the particular type ofxa0contract 48 thus for example an fob inland point for example an airport or a warehouse sale contract makes little sense what type of contract of carriage must the buyer make does the buyer owe the seller an obligation to make a contract of carriage under which the carrier is bound to take over the goods at the named inland point or at the nearest port to that point 49 again a cif named sea port sale contract where the buyer expects the goods to be brought to an inland point in the buyers country makes little sense must the seller procure a contract of carriage and insurance cover to the eventual inland destination intended by the parties or to the seaport named in the sale contract incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200211 50 gaps overlaps and unnecessary costs are likely to ariseand all this because the wrong incoterms rule has been chosen for the particular contract what makes the mismatch wrong is that insufficient regard has been given to the two most important features of the incoterms rules features which are mirrors of each other namely the port place or point of delivery and the transfer of risks 51 the reason for the frequent misuse of the wrong incoterms rule is that incoterms rules are frequently regarded exclusively as price indicators this or that is the exw fob or dap price the initials used in the incoterms rules are doubtless handy abbreviations for the formula used in the calculation of the price incoterms rules are not however exclusively or even primarily price indicators they are a list of general obligations that sellers and buyers owe each other under wellrecognised forms of sale contractand one of their main tasks is to indicate the port place or point of delivery where the risk isxa0transferred viii order within the incoterms 2020 rules 52 all the ten ab articles in each of the incoterms rules are importantbut some are more important than others 53 there has indeed been a radical shakeup in the internal order in which the ten articles within each incoterms rule have been organised in incoterms 2020 the internal order within each incoterms rule now follows this sequence a1b1 general obligations a2b2 deliverytaking delivery a3b3 transfer of risks a4b4 carriage a5b5 insurance a6b6 deliverytransport document a7b7 exportimport clearance a8b8 checkingpackagingmarking a9b9 allocation of costs a10b10 notices 54 it will be noticed that concerning the incoterms 2020 rules after recording in a1b1 the basic goodspayment obligations of the parties delivery and the transfer of risks are moved to a more prominent location namely to a2 and a3 respectively 55 the broad sequence thereafter goes ancillary contracts a4b4 and a5b5 carriage and insurance transport documents a6b6 incoterms 2020 12u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc exportimport clearance a7b7 packaging a8b8 costs a9b9 and notices a10b10 56 it is appreciated that this change in the order of the ab articles will take some timeand costto become familiar it is hoped that with delivery and risk now made more prominent traders will find it easier to identify the differences among the various incoterms rules ie the different points in time and place at which the seller delivers the goods to the buyer with risk transferring to the buyer from that time and point 57 for the first time the incoterms rules are published both in the traditional format setting out the eleven incoterms rules and in a new horizontal format setting out the ten articles within each incoterms rule under each of the headings listed above in paragraph 53 first for the seller and then for the buyer traders can therefore now far more easily see the difference for example between the place of delivery in fca and the place of delivery in dap or the items of cost which fall on a buyer in cif when compared with the items of cost which fall on a buyer in cfr it is hoped that this horizontal rep resentation of the incoterms 2020 rules will further assist traders in choosing the incoterms rule most appropriate to their commercial requirements ix differences between incoterms 2010 and 2020 58 the most important initiative behind the incoterms 2020 rules has been to focus on how the presentation could be enhanced to steer users towards the right incoterms rule for their sale contract thus a a greater emphasis in this introduction on making the right choice b a clearer explanation of the demarcation and connection between the sale contract and its ancillary contracts c upgraded guidance notes presented now as explanatory notes to each incoterms rule and d a reordering within the incoterms rules giving delivery and risk more prominence all these changes though cosmetic in appearance are in reality substantial attempts on the part of icc to assist the international trading community towards smoother export import transactions 59 apart from these general changes there are more substantive changes in the incoterms 2020 rules when compared with incoterms 2010 before looking at those changes mention must be made of a particular development in trade practice incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200213 which occurred since 2010 and which icc has decided should not lead to a change in the incoterms 2020 rules namely verified gross mass vgm 60 note on verified gross mass vgmsince 1 july 2016 regulation 2 under the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas imposed on shippers in the case of the shipment of containers the obligation either to weigh the packed container using calibrated and certified equipment or to weigh the contents of the container and add the weight of the container when empty in either case the vgm is to be recorded with the carrier a failure to comply bears the sanction under the solas convention that the container should not be loaded onto a ship see paragraph 42 msc1circ1475 9 june 2014 these weighing operations obviously incur expense and failure may lead to delay in loading as this happened after 2010 it is unsurprising that there was some pressure in the consultations leading to incoterms 2020 for a clear indication to be given as to who as between seller and buyer should bear such obligations 61 it was felt by the drafting group that obligations and costs relating to vgm were too specific and complex to warrant explicit mention in the incoterms 2020 rules 62 returning to the changes made by icc to the incoterms 2010 rules in the incoterms 2020 rules these are a bills of lading with an onboard notation and the fca incoterms rule b costs where they are listed c different levels of insurance cover in cif and cip d arranging for carriage with sellers or buyers own means of transport in fca dap dpu and ddp e change in the threeletter initials for dat to dpu f inclusion of securityrelated requirements within carriage obligations and costs g explanatory notes for users a bills of lading with an onboard notation and the fca incoterms rule 63 where goods are sold fca for carriage by sea sellers or buyers or more likely their banks where a letter of credit is in place might want a bill of lading with an onboard notation 64 however delivery under the fca rule is completed before the loading of the goods on board the vessel it is by no means certain that the seller can obtain an onboard bill of lading from the carrier that carrier is likely under its contract of carriage to be bound and entitled to issue an onboard bill of lading only once the goods are actually on board incoterms 2020 14u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc 65 to cater for this situation fca a6b6 of incoterms 2020 now provides for an additional option the buyer and the seller can agree that the buyer will instruct its carrier to issue an onboard bill of lading to the seller after the loading of the goods the seller then being obliged to tender that bill of lading to the buyer typically through the banks icc recognises that despite this somewhat unhappy union between an onboard bill of lading and fca delivery this caters for a demonstrated need in the marketplace finally it should be emphasised that even where this optional mechanism is adopted the seller is under no obligation to the buyer as to the terms of the contract ofxa0carriage 66 does it remain true to say that where containerised goods are delivered by seller to buyer by handing over to a carrier before loading onto a ship the seller is well advised to sell on fca terms rather than on fob terms the answer to that question is yes where incoterms 2020 have made a difference however is that where such a seller still wants or needs a bill of lading with an onboard notation the new additional option in the fca term a6b6 makes provision for such a document b costs where they are listed 67 in the new ordering of the articles within the incoterms 2020 rules costs now appear at a9b9 of each incoterms rule apart from that relocation however there is another change that will become obvious to users early on the various costs which fall to be allocated by various articles within the inco terms rules have traditionally appeared in different parts of each incoterms rule thus for example costs related to the obtaining of a delivery document in fob 2010 were mentioned in a8 the article under the heading delivery document but not in a6 the article under the heading allocation of costs 68 in the incoterms 2020 rules however the equivalent of a6b6 namely a9b9 now lists all the costs allocated by each particular incoterms rule a9b9 in the incoterms 2020 rules are consequently longer than a6b6 in the incoterms 2010xa0rules 69 the purpose is to provide users with a onestop list of costs so that the seller or buyer can now find in one place all the costs for which it would be responsible under that particular incoterms rule items of cost are also mentioned in their home article thus for example the costs involved in obtaining documents in fob still also appear at a6b6 as well as at a9b9 the thinking here was that users interested in discovering the specific allocation of documentary costs might be more inclined to go to the specific article dealing with delivery documents rather than to the general article listing all thexa0costs incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200215 c different levels of insurance cover in cif and cip 70 in the incoterms 2010 rules a3 of both cif and cip imposed on the seller the obligation to obtain at its own expense cargo insurance complying at least with the minimum cover as provided by clauses c of the institute cargo clauses lloyds market associationinternational underwriting association lmaiua or any similar clauses institute cargo clauses c provide cover for a number of listed risks subject to itemised exclusions institute cargo clauses a on the other hand cover all risks again subject to itemised exclusions during the consultations leading to the incoterms 2020 rules the case was made for moving from institute cargo clauses c to institute cargo clauses a thus increasing the cover obtained by the seller for the benefit of the buyer this could of course also involve an additional cost in premium the contrary case namely to stay with institute cargo clauses c was equally strongly put particularly by those involved in the maritime trade of commodities after considerable discussion within and beyond the drafting group the decision was made to provide for different minimum cover in the cif incoterms rule and in the cip incoterms rule in the first which is much more likely to be used in the maritime commodity trades the status quo has been retained with institute cargo clauses c as the default position although it is of course open to the parties to agree to higher cover in the second namely the cip incoterms rule the seller must now obtain insurance cover complying with institute cargo clauses a although it is of course again open to the parties to agree on a lower level of cover d arranging for carriage with sellers or buyers own means of transport in fca dap dpu and ddp 71 in the incoterms 2010 rules it was assumed throughout that where the goods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer they would be carried by a thirdparty carrier engaged for the purpose either by the seller or the buyer depending on which incoterms rule was used 72 it became clear in the deliberations leading to incoterms 2020 however that there were some situations where although the goods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer they could be so carried without any thirdparty carrier being engaged at all thus for example there was nothing stopping a seller on a d rule from arranging for such carriage without outsourcing that function to a third party namely by using its own means of transportation likewise with an fca purchase there was nothing to stop the buyer from using its own vehicle for the collection of the goods and for their transport to the buyers premises incoterms 2020 16u2002u2002international chamber of commerce icc 73 the rules appeared not to take account of these eventualities the incoterms 2020 rules now do by expressly allowing not only for the making of a contract of carriage but also for simply arranging for the necessary carriage e change in the threeletter initials for dat to dpu 74 the only difference between dat and dap in the incoterms 2010 rules was that in dat the seller delivered the goods once unloaded from the arriving means of transport into a terminal whereas in dap the seller delivered the goods when the goods were placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport for unloading it will also be recalled that the guidance note for dat in incoterms 2010 defined the word terminal broadly to include any place whether covered orxa0not 75 icc decided to make two changes to dat and dap first the order in which the two incoterms 2020 rules are presented has been inverted and dap where delivery happens before unloading now appears before dat secondly the name of the rule dat has been changed to dpu delivered at place unloaded emphasising the reality that the place of destination could be any place and not only a terminal however if that place is not in a terminal the seller should make sure that the place where it intends to deliver the goods is a place where it is able to unload the goods f inclusion of securityrelated requirements within carriage obligations and costs 76 it will be recalled that securityrelated requirements made a rather subdued entry into the incoterms 2010 rules through a2b2 and a10b10 in each rule the incoterms 2010 rules were the first revision of the incoterms rules to come into force after securityrelated concerns became so prevalent in the early part of this century those concerns and the associated shipping practices which they have created in their wake are now much more established connected as they are to carriage requirements an express allocation of securityrelated obligations has now been added to a4 and a7 of each incoterms rule the costs incurred by these requirements are also now given a more prominent position in the costs article namely a9b9 g explanatory notes for users 77 the guidance notes appearing at the start of each incoterms rule in the 2010 version now appear as explanatory notes for users these notes explain the fundamentals of each incoterms 2020 rule such as when it should be used when risk transfers and how costs are allocated between seller and buyer the explanatory notes are intended a to help the user accurately and efficiently steer towards the appropriate incoterms 2020 international chamber of commerce iccu2002u200217 incoterms rule for a particular transaction and b to provide those deciding or advising on disputes or contracts governed by incoterms 2020 with guidance on matters which might require interpretation for guidance on more fundamental issues that cut across the incoterms 2020 rules more gener ally reference may of course also be made to the text of thisxa0introduction x caution with variants of incoterms rules 78 sometimes the parties want to alter an incoterms rule the incoterms 2020 rules do not prohibit such alteration but there are dangers in so doing in order to avoid any unwel come surprises the parties would need to make the intended effect of such alterations extremely clear in their contract thus for example if the allocation of costs in the incoterms 2020 rules is altered in the contract the parties should also clearly state whether they intend to vary the point at which delivery is made and the risk transfers to the buyer charles debattista special icc advisor incoterms 2020 drafting group 36 stone

1 this document of faqs serves as a brief introduction to intellectual property rights it is intended to provide a short introduction to the basics any specific questions should be referred to manes legal and ip department 1 what is intellectual property intellectual property ip refers to creations of the mind such as inventions literary and artistic works designs and symbols names and images used in commerce ip is protected in specific laws which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create by striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest the ip system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish 2 what are the common types of ip patents registered designs or design patent trademarks copyrights trade secrets 3 what is a patent a patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention which is a product or a process that provides in general a new product or way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a technical problem patents protect the features and processes that make things work patent rights let inventors profit from their inventions patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made used distributed or sold without the patent owners consent patent rights are usually enforced in courts that in most systems hold the authority to stop patent infringement conversely a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party 4 what is a trademark a trademark is a distinctive sign or mark which identifies certain goods or services as those produced or provided by a specific person or enterprise 5 what can be registered as a trademark words logos slogans sounds colors shapes smells 6 what is a registered design a design is the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article the design may consist of threedimensional features such as the shape or surface of an article or of twodimensional features such as patterns lines or color 7 what is copyright copyright is the set of exclusive rights granted to the creator of an original work eg a piece of music song lyrics films novels photographs paintings web pages including the right to copy distribute and adapt the work like all of the other ip rights these rights can be licensed transferred andor assigned 8 what is an intellectual property licensing agreement a licensing agreement involves the transfer of intellectual property rights and potentially proprietary knowledge in return for royalty as revenue from one company or individual to anotherinventorship frequently asked questions mane legal ip department may 12 2021 page 1 of 1 this document of faqs serves as a brief introduction to the concept of inventorship any specific questions should be referred to manes legal and ip department 1 what information is necessary to identify an inventor the determination of inventorship is a legal conclusion based on facts accordingly specific details characterizing each contributors work on the project must be detailed in the patentability study request form while most if not all patent statutes around the world fail to provide a precise definition of inventor it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features ie novel andor nonobvious of the invention conception which is the key to inventorship may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice and because inventions are defined by the claims an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that she conceived additionally those claim elements must be one of the inventive novel or nonobvious elements if requested the project leader may be required to submit evidence of contribution for each person eg laboratory notebook pages or reports showing the conception of at least one inventive element of the claimed invention 2 my colleague and i worked together on the project who is the inventor when two or more people collaborate in conceiving a claimed invention then those people are joint inventors each joint inventor must be aware of the contribution of the other and each must contribute to the formation of the solution to a problem that is the invention thus joint inventorship is the process by which people cooperate to solve a problem and in which each person makes some mental contribution to the final conception of the solution the entire inventive concept need not occur to each of the joint inventors and they need not physically work on the project together or at the same time nor do their contributions need to be the same or equal all that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application please note that merely being present during a meeting providing research support setting up experiments at the instruction of another analytical testing or simply instructing others to perform research does not by itself indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention 3 who is responsible for identifying inventors patent counsel at mane bears the responsibility in association with preparing a patent application to identifying the inventors consequently successfully identifying inventors involves assessing the nature of contribution by each person this assessment is necessary to permit the applicant to meet its legal obligation in most if not all of the national patent offices to provide to an accurate listing of inventors on a patent application failure to provide an accurate list of inventors may in some circumstances compromise the validity and enforceability of the resulting patent inadvertently naming or omitting an inventor is generally a correctable error but intentionally naming or omitting an inventor can result in the patent being found unenforceable against alleged infringersmane laboratory notebook policy mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 1 of 10

trainees interns in charge of product or production process development work shall utilize a companyissued laboratory notebook to record any rd work that foreseeably involves the creation of new nonobvious and commercially relevant products processes or equipment the primary purpose of a laboratory notebook is to preserve and protect intellectual property rights in all new and improved products processes or equipment by serving as a record and archive for all research and development work ideas experiments formulations etc a laboratory notebook when properly utilized may be used as legal evidence with respect to various aspects of the new or improved methodsproducts such as conception andor reduction to practice of an invention and dates corresponding thereto test results and the like in this respect laboratory notebooks enable inventors uf0a7 to record and provide an accounting of the intellectual and technical progress corresponding to each project carried out uf0a7 to explain the manner in which an experiment was carried out and how the results of that experiment was obtained and thus serve as the definitive account of what transpired which thereby ensures the reproducibility of the experiment and uf0a7 to ensure the preservation of information which may be useful for both internal and external communications eg writing scientific publications preparing presentations drafting of patent applications transfer of technology etc by following the steps prescribed herein for their implementation mane laboratory notebooks will possess the authenticity to serve as evidentiary tools in the event of litigations disputes or claims proper implementation of the prescribed procedure will create laboratory notebooks that can be used uf0a7 to certify that on a specified date the holder possessed the information contained therein eg experimental results scientific observation working hypotheses etc uf0a7 to specifically define the information created by the holder such as working hypothesis reflections experimental designs and results which may assist with determining inventorship establishing invention rights and providing data for patent filings and uf0a7 to provide a factual accounting toward the degree of participation eg intellectual and material contribution of an individual andor a company in the design of an invention accordingly a properly

ordinary skill in the relevant art to reproduce recorded work and to obtain at least similar results 21 general rules regarding form uf0a7 preferably the language of the laboratory notebook is english but french or spanish may be acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the mane innovation center uf0a7 the information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet dated using two digits for the day at least three letters to uniquely identify the month and four digits for the year eg 20 may 2017 or 05 nov 2017 and referenced with its company project name or number andor an internal reference specific to the researcher uf0a7 the recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the pages of the notebook respecting the full width of the pages uf0a7 the insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided as information may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning note 3 if the need for a later entry or amendment arises it is advisable to use unmarked section of the page immediately below and particularly point out the passages concerned where no such unmarked section is available one should make the entryamendment on a subsequent page and record the subsequent page number on the instant page an arrow asterisk etc can be used to precisely identify the section being amended or corrected recording data can also be carried out by means of inserting preprinted information in the notebook for example typed reports diagrams diagrams output datum of equipment of analysis photographs etc the preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of the page nor cover any information already entered on the page transparent tape or other adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface for two successive inserts the second must be affixed below the other or on two successive pages and not side by side each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both the writer and the witness each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between the insert and the support page other than the aforementioned dates and signatures no other handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted note 4 if there is a need to annotate information on an insert eg for reasons of clarity the original preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page note 5 it is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook for example if the data set is too large the writer can also create alternative archives for the data eg an electronic database of hplc chromatographs and simply reference the corresponding file number note 6 rather than the original of an experimental material a photograph or a digitized reproduction may be used such as in the case of a thinlayer chromatography plate a gel a membrane an autoradiography or a thermosensitive ticket mane laboratory notebook policy mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 6 of 10 significant blank spaces between two information entries for example successions of blank lines page breaks pages left blank or to the right of an insert must be crossed out by means of a z so that no information may be subsequently added the removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook all handwritten entries shall be made using permanent ink there is no restriction on the choice of ink colors to be used provided that the recorded information remains fully legible and comprehensible in full after black and white reproduction using a standard photocopier black or dark blue inks are recommended the use of erasable ink pencil or white correction fluid is not allowed the texts and entries must be legible any erasure must be referred to and dated both by the editor and the witness any coding of information using specific colors should be avoided if the use of colors cannot be avoided the selection of colors andor textures must be made with careful consideration of a possible need for subsequent reproduction using a standard photocopier in black and white on each page containing an entry the name of the project and laboratory notebook number must be entered in the designated location at the top of the page 22 general rules regarding substance each test experiment or analysis whether positive or negative must be recorded in the laboratory record care should be taken to ensure that the following elements are clearly and precisely stated uf0a7 the context in which the work was carried out the objectives set andor the problem to be solved the working hypotheses etc uf0a7 the experimental conditions used protocols particular parameters and material used and uf0a7 the results obtained their possible interpretation as well as any ideas reflections or comments relating thereto note 7 if a protocol has already been previously described in the same or different laboratory notebook it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry rather it is sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity ie the laboratory notebook number and pages concerned along with the name of its author all modifications changes or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described referencing scientific publications or books is permissible if identified unambiguously using a full bibliographical citation abbreviations may be used however abbreviations that are nonstandard to persons having ordinary skill in the relevant field must be defined at their first appearance further abbreviations along with their definition should also be recorded after the table of contentsindex section at the front of the laboratory notebook note 8 it is possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures and protocols abbreviations etc and then make an appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook mane laboratory notebook policy mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 7 of 10 23 required duties of author and witness each laboratory notebook must be regularly submitted to a witness review process witnesses are mane employees having the ability or background to understand the invention for example if the invention involves advanced chemical or electronic concepts the witness must possess adequate background in the relevant field if called upon later the witness must be able to testify to their own knowledge that the facts of the entry are correct however the witness must not have the status of coauthor joint researcher of the recorded information nor should the witness be able to be considered as coinventor of any invention resulting from all or part of the experimental information accordingly the

laboratory recordkeeping procedures mane legal ip department october 27 2017 page 10 of 10 general instruction laboratory notebooks are the means for keeping a permanent record of the details of an individuals daytoday work in the research and development areas they provide 1 a basic reference which the individual and others can refer to at a later date 2 legal evidence with respect to the materials recorded such as conception of an invention and date thereof or date of reduction to practice and test results and 3 in some instances compliance with the provisions of many contractual arrangements instructions for recording data in the laboratory notebook 1 all entries should be made in a legible and orderly manner using permanent ink preferably black make entries clear and complete that someone else could repeat the experiment 2 avoid erasures if an error is made cross it out and make the correction immediately thereafter cancellations or insertions should be initialed dated and explained by an appropriate notation 3 make sure control page is filled out prior to usage 4 complete the table of contents as you make entries in the notebook 5 state the object and results of each experiment clearly and concisely give a complete factual and self explanatory account of the progress of the work and the procedure followed reference to earlier work done by yourself or another may be accomplished by noting a previous page of the same notebook or the page and number of an earlier notebook describe and give quantities of all materials used explain all code numbers and abbreviations 6 an entry dealing with a conception invention idea must describe the thing conceived example whether it is a chemical compound a combination of a compound and a solvent etc as well as the utility for the ting conceived how it is to be used and the methods by which it is to be prepared including equivalent materials which could be used statements with regard to utility should be stated positively work toward practical implementation of an invention should start as soon as possible in a notebook 7 negative or deprecatory entries should be avoided example a reaction gives a 2 yield was expected do not state process does not work phraseology which expresses an opinion rather than a positive statement and gratuitous comments should be avoided this is not an instruction to omit the conclusion of an experiment which had less than the expected results be factual 8 each days work should whenever possible be started on a separate page with lines drawn down angularly across the unused portion of the previous page this gives legal evidence that additions were not made at a later date it is permissible as stated above to make reference to an earlier page by reciting continued from page it is extremely important that each page show the date of entry 9 each page must be signed and dated by the individual who makes the entry and does the work in addition each page must be witnessed signed and dated using the notation read and understood preferably on the same day but at least within one week the witness should not be connected with the conception should not have taken part in the experimental work performed by another but should understand the technical filed of the entry record laboratory notebook number and project on each page 10 where a conception is made by two or more individuals it need only be entered in the notebook of one but must be signed and dated by all the conceivers ideally all conceivers should sign on the same day 11 for microfilming purposes graphs charts analytical data etc must be attached to the notebook pages with a permanent adhesive and should when unfolded be kept within the confines of the opened notebook no entries should be made on the page beneath attached sheets and nothing must be obscured leave the heading on the top and the space provided for the witnessing signature at the bottom of each page exposed inserts should be signed and dated by the person making the entry and witnessed by another to provide the best legal evidence if materials such as spectra graphs etc are not kept in the notebook they must be signed dated and identified in such a manner as to provide a reference back to the pertinent pages of the laboratory notebook itself 12 report the loss or theft of a research notebook 13 following the use of all the pages of each notebook it must be sent to the library for record maintenance make sure table of contents pages are complete after it has been recorded it will be returned to the individual an individual may retain in his possession the laboratory notebook immediately preceding the one in which entries are currently being made normally all other laboratory notebooks will be kept on file in the library or in vault storage they may then be checked out for reasonable lengths of time by authorized individuals instructions read and includedunderstood by date signaturemane confidentiality policy frequently asked questions what is the purpose of a confidentiality agreement a confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement abbreviated as cda or nda is used to protect confidential and proprietary information it requires that the counterparty keep the information secret prohibits the counterparty from exploiting the information for its economic advantage and establishes that all ownership rights remain with the original party when is a cda needed when mane will share confidential information with another person or entity also when someone will observe or learn about manes confidential information additionally when any of the parties mane and counterparty wish to disclose confidential information to each other what is confidential information confidential information is usually nonpublic information for which misappropriation could give a competitor a competitive advantage what are some types of confidential information formulas samples processes and knowhow are common examples others could include methods ideas concepts techniques research experimental work developments inventions whether or not patentable scientific and clinical information design details drawings diagrams engineering specifications ingredients chemical composition recipes customer orand supplier data business records financial information legal andor corporate information sales data sales analyses forecasts plans business staffing product development etc prices margins strategy equipment technical specifications incident reports complaints claims business arrangements contracts contract terms origin of products and reports which mane entity or affiliate is the contracting party of the cda the legal entity which employs the employees who will be disclosing the information to the counterparty should be the contracting entity if several mane entities are involved each should be contracting party who is responsible for managing the confidentiality agreement with the counterparty manes representative in the relationship with the counterparty is responsible for adherence to the confidentiality policy including the followup obligations this individual is likewise responsible for being familiar with the rights and obligations of the cda and ensuring that mane observes all requirements of the agreement how do i register a cda every cda whether using manes template or one received from a counterparty must be immediately registered in the central register on sharepoint in order to allocate a register id enter the reference id in the footer of the agreement and mention it in any document used to disclose confidential information including the sentence confidential information subject to the terms and conditions of contract no include reference number is the designated representative the same as the signatory no the designated representative is the individual who is most directly responsible for managing the relationship and is the contact person for notices the signatory is the individual authorized to sign the agreement and bind the company sometimes they are the same person but often they are not is it possible to review confidentiality agreements sent by the counterparty manes representative should always seek the use of manes templates however when necessary mane will consider reviewing the counterpartys cda in that case it is the responsibility of manes representative to read the entire document before submitting the document to be registered and to provide mane legal ip department their comments on the cda and all necessary information to allow a proper review mane entities concerned subject matter retroactive effect duration do i need to involve the legal ip department consultation of the legal ip department is not needed only if you use a mane template and the counterparty signs without amendment legal is not checking the proper fillin of a mane template it must be done by manes representative in the relationship under hisher responsibility in all other cases particularly including amendments proposed by the counterparty to manes cda proposal or if the counterparty submits its form you must submit for review by legal but not until the agreement is properly registered in accordance with the confidentiality policy when completing manes template how do i define the subject matter the subject matter describes the purpose of the exchange of confidential information with the counterparty it is especially important to define this properly because it i establishes what information is covered ie only information shared that pertains to the subject matter is protected under the agreement and ii limits how the other party can use the information ie use of the confidential information is restricted to activities consistent with the subject matter the subject matter must be defined precisely as much as possible in order to provide clarity on the confidential information that is to be protected example the parties intend to investigate a possible business relationship regarding manes development and proposal of fragrance compositions and delivery systems thereof for integration by customer into its own hair care products and shall commence mutual discussions relating thereto please note the protection of the confidential information disclosed between the parties is not the subject matter for ud formula disclosure cdas how can the authorized persons list be updated reorganizationxa0 the counterparty must notify mane of any reorganization that affects the authorized persons eg withdrawal change of title etcxa0 such individuals will no longer be authorized persons unless agreed in writing by mane replacementxa0 the counterparty may only replace an authorized person with another employee who is responsible for toxicological safety or regulatory affairs within the counterparty regulatory affairs department or equivalentxa0 the counterparty should issue a letter on company letterhead and the new authorized person must sign committing personally to comply with the cda in replacement of the named former authorized personxa0 the individual being replaced will no longer be an authorized person additionxa0 if the counterparty seeks to add a new authorized person such person should be an employee of the counterparty responsible for toxicological safety or regulatory affairs within the counterparty regulatory affairs department or equivalent xa0a written amendment to the cdas appendix signed by both parties is requiredxa0 the overall list needs to remain limited in number is it possible to extend the term of a cda already signed yes please use the amendment template to renew a cda in french english or spanish on sharepoint and register it like any other cda is it possible to add another party to a cda already signed yes please use the amendment template to renew a cda in french english or spanish on sharepoint and register it like any other cda what if mane already has a cda with the counterparty it must be checked to confirm i the subject matter statement ie scope is broad enough to protect the contemplated confidential exchange ii it remains active and will continue to be valid during the period needed for the particular project even if a new cda is needed it may nevertheless be necessary to state in the new contract that the old cda remains valid so it is not superseded if any doubts confer with the legal ip department is a cda needed for a facility visit the facility visitor information and confidentiality policy can be found here it must be signed without amendment by every nonmane employee who visits manes buildings what if the three standard templates on sharepoint do not fit my needs consult the legal ip department explain if there is a particular reason that customization of the template is needed mane legal maintains other specialized templates eg threeparty toll contract manufacturing audit and material transfer what happens if a cda proposal is never signed if a cda is not signed it must be mentioned on the central register through the modification of its status from xa0draftxa0 to xa0abandonedxa0 without the deletion of its registration as a wholemane confidentiality policy access to the updated templates and to the central register listing all the confidentiality agreements issued in the mane group is restricted to a limited number of persons for confidentiality reasons if in the corporatelegaliplegalconfidentiality sharepoint site you do not visualize the register and the templates it means that you have not been given access in such a case you need to contact one of the persons having access in your department

document of faqs serves as a brief introduction to the basic process for securing patent rights it is intended to provide only a short introduction to the patenting process at mane any specific questions should be referred to manes legal and ip department for more general information on patents and patent rights see our general faq httpsmosscorpemeasesammanecomlegalipippatents20useful20information faqs 1 how is a patent application created at mane the patenting process begins with obtaining approval for a patentability study from one of the following committees cominnov innovation valorization and transfer committee spdg00101 comsci conception development and industrialization committee spds00104 2 what information is necessary for initiating a patentability study the purpose of a patentability study is to assess the likelihood of obtaining a granted patent having meaningful protection thus in order to assess patentability of a new product or process the inventorscontributors must provide patent counsel with specific details of the product or process including an explanation of the technical problem being solved successful and unsuccessful experiments known prior art and how the new product or process is different from old or known products or processes after studying the provided details the new product or process is defined by one or more hypothetical claims which are then evaluated by comparing the hypothetical claims to the prior art prior art is any evidence information that the invention was already publicly known or available in whole or in part before the effective filing date of the patent application and includes publicly available information such as published patent documents scientific journal articles web pages technical data sheets etc 3 what happens after a patentability study at the conclusion of the patentability study patent counsel will prepare a final written patentability report which shall include a description of the invention the hypothetical claims a listing of the relevant prior art documents found in the prior art search and an analysis as to the novelty and inventiveness of the hypothetical claims visvis the relevant prior art documents the report will conclude with a recommendation to proceed or not with the preparation and filing of patent application because the patenting system requires disclosure of the technical details of the invention in exchange for a chance at obtaining patent rights there is a risk of disclosure without any patent rights as such in some instances and prior to making a favorable recommendation rd may be asked to perform additional testing or experiments to enhance manes chances for obtaining a granted patent 4 what is involved with preparing a patent application the process for preparing a patent application involves a collaboration between patent counsel and the inventors patent counsel will generally begin the process by preparing patenting process frequently asked questions mane legal ip department 2 february 2021 page 2 of 3 a set of claims describing the metes and bounds of the invention and then build the remaining sections of the patent application therefrom to provide the requisite antecedent basis for the claims in order to correct any errors andor provide missing or supplemental information the initial draft application must be reviewed by the inventors while rare at this stage rd may be asked to perform additional experiments but only if absolutely necessary prior to filing at the end of the reviewrevision process a final draft of the patent application must be approved by the inventors prior to filing since the draft patent application needs to be approved by the inventors another important piece of information that should accompany the invention disclosure is a listing of persons who materially contributed to the creation of the invention from the listing of contributors mane patent counsel will conduct an inquiry into the nature of each contributors involvement and make a legal determination as to whose contribution rises to the level of inventorship it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features ie novel andor nonobvious of the invention conception which is the key to inventorship may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice and because inventions are defined by the claims an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that she conceived additionally those claim elements must be one of the inventive elements to be coinventors the contributions of each person need not be equal or the same all that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application please note that being present during a meeting providing research support setting up experiments at the instruction of another or sensoryanalytical testing does not by itself indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention 5 what parts make up a patent application since a patent application serves to provide a written description describing and enabling others to practice and use the invention the inventors must provide patent counsel with sufficient details to create the application the detailed invention disclosure provided to patent counsel will be used to create the basic parts sections of a patent application which include title abstract background summary of the invention brief description of the drawings if applicable detailed description of the invention and the claims 6 where is the initial patent application filed the initial filing or socalled priority filing is typically performed where the invention is made 7 what happens after a patent application is filed the filing of a patent application is not the end of the process but really the beginning of a formal examination process moreover it is necessary to make decisions regarding the filing of one or more foreign patent applications patenting process frequently asked questions mane legal ip department 2 february 2021 page 3 of 3 under the paris convention an international treaty created in 1883 requiring member countries to adopt certain minimum protections for industrial property the priority filing permits the applicant to file one or more corresponding patent application in additional countries within 12 months from the priority filing date under the patent cooperation treaty pct which is another international treaty concluded in 1970 a single filing of a pct application may be made with a receiving office ro in one language a pct application does not itself result in the grant of a patent since there is no such thing as an international patent instead a pct application serves to establish a filing date in all contracting states and must be followed up one or more national or regional phase applications to proceed towards grant of one or more patents the pct procedure essentially leads to a standard national or regional patent application which may be granted or rejected according to applicable law in each jurisdiction in which a patent is desired if a pct application is desired then it must be filed within 12 months from the priority filing date ie the same deadline under the paris convention however the deadline for filing national phase applications from the pct application varies from member states but is generally 30 months from the priority filing date so in essence the pct serves as a mechanism to delay the decision for filing patent applications from 12 months to about 30 months but only in the 153 member countries in each jurisdiction the claims of the patent application are evaluated for clarity novelty and inventiveness after 18 months from the earliest priority date the application publishes and thus the invention is available to the public 8 what to expect during examination of a patent application the examination of a patent application begins with an examiner reviewing the clarity novelty and inventiveness of the claims visvis the prior art the examiner then issues an office action which in most cases includes a rejectionobjection of one or more of the pending claims an applicant is given a limited period of time eg 34 months to respond to the office action which may include arguments claim amendments andor evidence supporting the patentability of the pending claims depending on the nature of the rejectionobjection the inventors may be consulted for technical input to assist patent counsel with developing claim amendmentsrebuttal arguments to overcome the examiners rejectionsobjections ideally the inventors should also be aware of what embodiments are being utilized in manes commercial productprocess thus this collaboration between patent counsel and the inventors should provide mane the best opportunity to obtain commerciallyrelevant granted patentspatents frequently asked questions mane legal ip department june 19 2020 page 1 of 1 this document of faqs serves as a brief introduction to patent rights it is intended to provide a short introduction to the basics any specific questions should be referred to manes legal and ip department 1 what is a patent a patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention which is a product or a process that provides in general a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem a few exemplary inventions include 1 a new process for making seamless capsules 2 a new fragrance molecule or 3 a new composition that blocks bitterness taste of high intensity sweeteners patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made used distributed or sold without the patent owners consent patent rights are usually enforced in courts that in most systems hold the authority to stop patent infringement conversely a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party 2 what is patentable an invention must in general fulfill the following conditions to be protected by a patent 1 industrially applicable useful it must be of practical use 2 new it must show an element of novelty meaning some new characteristic that is not part of the body of existing knowledge in its particular technical field that body of existing knowledge is called prior art 3 inventive not obvious it must show an inventive step that is not obvious or routine by a person with average knowledge of the technical field the subject matter of the invention must also be accepted as patentable under the patent laws of a given county in many countries scientific theories mathematical methods plant or animal varieties discoveries of natural substances commercial methods or methods of medical treatment as opposed to medical products are not generally patentable for example abstract ideas einsteins equation emc2 laws of nature gravity or natural occurring phenomena a chemical found in nature are not patentable but specific applications of these things could be patentable 3 how long does a patent last patent rights may last for up to 20 years if renewal or maintenance fees are paid in a timely manner 4 which countries are covered by a patent patents are granted by national patent offices or by regional offices that carry out examination work for a group of countries for example the european patent office epo and the african intellectual property organization oapi under such regional systems an applicant requests protection for an invention in one or more countries and each country decides whether to offer patent protection within its borders the wipoadministered patent cooperation treaty pct provides for the filing of a single international patent application that has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries however in order to obtain a patent in a pct member nation a patent application must be filed and prosecuted in the pct member nation 5 what is patent infringement patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder permission may typically be granted in the form of a license the definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention in many countries a use is required to be commercial or to have a commercial purpose to constitute patent infringement the scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent in other words the terms of the claims inform the public of what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder patents are territorial and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force 6 what do i do if i think i have an invention do not disclose your invention to anyone outside of the company and contact manes legal and ip departmentpd flash gdpr in a few words february 4 2020 the general data protection regulation better known as gdpr regulation eu 2016679 of the european parliament and of the council of april 27 2016 governs the processing of personal data notably throughout the territory of the european union since may 25 2018 in practice we must be able to demonstrate to the supervisory authorities the compliance of mane group to the gdpr when employees have to process personal data as such you have a key role as dp coordinator within the meaning of the mane group code of conduct for personal data english version attached this is the reason why you will regularly receive summary information as a reminder via pd flash emails to complete the initial training provided to all of the mane group dp coordinators dp coordinators who have not attended one of our training sessions since 2018 will be invited in the coming days to new sessions

functioning of the mane group a vast amount of an employees personal data is necessary for the management of their career and our services within mane and we must all help to protect it for this some advice ask employees only for necessary information for business purposes and avoid processing socalled sensitive data health union activity political opinions religion ethnic origin if you must process it special obligations apply and are addressed by policy ensure confidentiality and security thus only authorized persons should have access actions on data carried out by authorized persons must be recorded know who connects to what when and to do what logical but also physical measures must be taken to ensure its conservation and confidentiality inform the employees concerned each time you process their personal data example update of administrative data training request evaluation interview form etc finally always remember that employees can request a copy of all their personal data that you hold for example copy of a pay slip statement of a timesavings account telephone records card reader statements or messages sent via professional email and that this request can also be made by exemployees in case of doubt about the legitimacy declaration retention or securing of the processing of personal data of an employee by your mane department or subsidiary contact the dpo mane

employees must be identified as such in their subject title specifying personal or private or be stored in a directory entitled personal or private any email or file that has not been identified by an employee as personal will fail to be considered professional in nature and freely viewable by mane as reminded by article 34 of the mane it charter to which the mane rules of governance refer in the event where the users employment contract terminates the user shall before the user leaves the company retrieve and delete any file or personal email before the user effectively leaves in particular the user must empty the nobackup directory on the users workstation subfolder located in my documents do not delete any professional data that could be useful to the company return all documents

and processors provide concise transparent understandable and easily accessible information in simple and clear terms to the persons concerned this transparency obligation is defined in articles 12 13 and 14 of the gdpr the methods of providing and presenting this information must be adapted to the context transparency allows those concerned know the reason for collecting the various data concerning them understand the treatment that will be made of their data ensure control of their data by facilitating the exercise of their rights so remember when you are processing personal data in the context of the activity of your service or the company to inform the persons whose data is being processed by any effective means beforehand for example by sending an email delivering an information note by hand drafting a clause in a contract this information must be prior to the collection of personal data for a new processing or when personal data already collected and processed are again processed for another purpose than that initially indicated to the data subject you will find attached a template of information note to adapt to each type of treatment and to be sent to the persons who need to be informedpd flash 13 involvement of hr and it departments in compliance with the gdpr dear all hr and it departments are those who more than any other in a company collect store and process personal data and must secure it it is up to companies to prove that these two services have brought their operating processes into compliance with the gdpr indeed they must be constantly involved in discussions around the protection of personal data regarding the hr department it may have to respond to any employees assertion of his right of access rectification or deletion of his personal data the hr department must therefore ensure that it knows where this information is stored and be able to gather it quickly in order to respond to any requests from employees it implies that the hr department knows exactly where all the personal data are held optimizes its systems to better manage this information but also are able to prove to employees that their requests regarding their data have been processed in order to achieve this it must consider all of the information generated by an employee from his job interview to his effective departure from the company recruitment medical information wage payments and travel information are particularly sensitive the it department on the other hand is responsible for ensuring the security of the personal data that the company processes and holds it must guarantee the integrity of the data provenance by minimizing the risk of data loss or hacking the measures to be taken whether digital or physical depend on the sensitivity of the data processed and the risks to which people are exposed in the event of an incident the flaws can have serious consequences for those who have entrusted personal data in the event of loss disclosure or unwanted modification of their data it department must be able to detect them quickly and resolve the incident as quickly as possibleflash dp 14 gdpr management of your customers suppliers relationship the control of the personal data of our customers prospects or suppliers constitutes a guarantee of quality and trust regarding mane this requires that specific rules are needed when you the collect and use of personal data name email telephone number postal address etc for the purposes of establishing a commercial relationship depending on the prospecting method email telephone or text message that you use the persons contacted must first have given their consent to receive your messages optin generally in b2c or not have expressed their refusal opt out usually in b2b in any case people should be able to refuse to receive further requests from you offer them this possibility when you contact them example an unsubscribe link in your emails and take these requests into account example update the list of people contacted and the list of people who objected if your operations are intended to retain your customers suppliers think about the following 3 rules the collection of certain personal data is not imperative for all commercial approaches you must justify the usefulness of all the personal data collected and processed eg fax number if never used at the time of collection inform your customers suppliers about what you will do with their data by sending them our gtc an information notice on the document intended to collect personal data or an information email by example do not forget to provide them with the address dpomanecom to contact for the exercise of their rights of access rectification opposition and erasure do not keep their data indefinitely plan the deletion of information in the event of a prolonged commercial relationship with your customers suppliers the commission nationale de linformatique et des liberts cnil as the independent french administrative regulatory body whose mission is to ensure that data privacy law is applied to the collection storage and use of personal data recommends a maximum data retention period of 3 years from the end of the commercial relationship if however you must keep certain data due to legal obligations beyond this period archive them in another database whos access is more restrictedpd flash 2 what is meant by personal data february 11 2020 a first fundamental step to understand better your rights and ensure the optimal protection of the personal data of your colleagues customers suppliers service providers external contacts trainees and any person transmitting their personal data is to define what personal data are as opposed to what can be excluded from the sphere of application of gdpr personal data are any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person but because they concern persons they must retain control over them a natural person can be identified directly eg surname and first name indirectly eg by a telephone number or license plate an identifier such as the social security number a postal or email address but also the voice or image the identification of a natural person can be carried out from a single information eg name from the crossmatching of a set of data eg a woman living at such address born on this day and member of such association however company contact details eg company company a with its postal address switchboard telephone number and a generic contact email company1emailcom are not personal datapd flash 3 what is the processing of personal data and the data controller february 19 2020 since we often receive questions about this topic it seems useful to us to specify two essential definitions about the processing of personal data and the data controller personal data processing is all operations relating to personal data regardless of the process used for example save organize store modify compare to other data transmit personal data etc different types of processing personal data is not limited to the computerized processing of files it can be a database or an excel table but also a video surveillance installation a credit card payment or biometric recognition system a smartphone application etc new processing methods appear regularly and evolve according to technological innovations computerized or not a processing of personal data can be computerized or not for example a paper document might be organized according to a filing plan or candidate application forms classified in alphabetical or chronological order are also a processing of personal data the controller is the legal person company public authority etc or natural person who determines the purposes and means of a processing defines the purpose and the method of carrying it out within mane group it is not an individual or department but the body corporate of mane group which processes personal datapd flash 4 sanctions under the gdpr february 28 2020 in 2019 mane group completed the implementation of the new gdpr rules according to cnil the data protection supervisory authority for mane group all controls and the penalties associated with their violation are now in full force and effect the old legislation provided for relatively reduced sanctions and enforcement was infrequent by refraining until the end of 2018 to sanction noncompliance with gdpr the cnil wanted to allow data controllers to gradually understand and assimilate the requirements of the gdpr adopted in 2016 this transition now complete the first major sanctions were applied by the cnil in 2019 starting with the exemplary one of 50 million euros against google and then of 500000 euros against the company futura international and of 400000 euros against sergic the maximum sanction for the mane group is 55 million euros these sanctions can be made public while man group believes the gdpr rules are in the best interests of our employees customers and partners the significant financial penalties and reputational damage which can result from violations should cause each of us to redouble our commitment to compliancepd flash 5 definitions of data protection rights march 4 2020 the persons concerned by the gdpr have rights allowing them to keep control over their personal data when they are processed by other persons legal or natural different types of rights the right to be informed to be fair and lawful the collection of personal data must be accompanied by prior clear and concise explanation to the persons whose personal data are processed the collection of express consent by the data controller consentxa0must be freelyxa0givenxa0specific informed and unambiguous in order to obtain valid consent it must bexa0givenxa0on a voluntary basis online consent can be given for example by ticked boxes but not by preticked boxes the consent is not always required but it is in case of collection of sensitive data reuse of data for other purposes use of cookies and use of personal data for prospecting purposes electronically the right to object people must be able to object to the reuse by the data controller of their personal data anyone has the right to object for legitimate reasons to the processing of their data unless it is necessary to meet a legal obligation the rights of access and rectification any person can access to all the information concerning him or her know the origin of this information access to the information upon which a decision concerning him or her was based obtain a copy and demand that his or her data be rectified supplemented updated or deleted right to be forgotten obligation to respond the data controller must respond to data subject requests within one month including when it has no data on the requesting person for example the data has been deleted unless the requests are manifestly abusive in particular by their quantity their repetitive or systematic nature in case of refusal of an access request it must be duly justified and must be accompanied by information on the procedures and time limits for appealspd flash 6 record of processing activities to concretely measure the impact of the gdpr on our activities it was necessary to identify precisely the processing of personal data performed by each department within mane group at headquarters and in the subsidiaries keeping a register of personal data processing allows us to map our processing and to justify our personal data processing in the personal data processing register it is necessary to identify precisely the different processing of personal data the categories of personal data processed the objectives pursued by the data processing operations the persons internal or external who process this data the chain of custody of personal data in particular to identify any data transfers outside the european union in order to keep this mapping of personal data processed by the mane group up to date the participation of each department and each subsidiary in the inventory declaration and updating of processing operations is

like mane ensuring compliance with the gdpr at the level of the whole group therefore beyond french and european establishments in the strict sense is essential in fact the penalty for a violation by a subsidiary would be set as a percentage of the revenue of the entire group and would consequently generate a major financial and image impact for mane the text of the gdpr regulation defines the fundamental concept of coresponsibility the parent company v mane fils is considered to be responsible for processing personal data and must offer the guarantee to the authorities that all of its subsidiaries which are coprocessors comply with the gdpr so that it can itself be considered compliant we must therefore ensure the effective compliance of all our european subsidiaries as they are directly subject to gdpr regulations all our subsidiaries outside the european union because these subsidiaries process personal data of european nationals eg data concerning expats contacts in outlook of european colleagues contacts and other information about employees service providers suppliers distributors or european customers and all personal data of european nationals collected by

uf076 the recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the pages of the notebook respecting the full width of the pages uf076 the insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided as information may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning note 3 if the need for a later entry or amendment arises it is advisable to use unmarked

preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page note 5 it is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook for example if the data set is too large the writer can also create alternative archives for the data eg an electronic database of hplc chromatographs and simply reference the corresponding file number note 6 rather than the original of an experimental material a photograph or a digitized reproduction may be used such as in the case of a thinlayer chromatography plate a

maintain and update the register of breachessupply terms conditions playbook these supply tcs playbook guidelines are intended to cover the review of contracts proposed by counterparties more and more in the form of general specifications or quality agreements etc and the review of amendments to manes supply agreement proposals that are made by counterparties our very first concern is liability a provision to limit it is compulsory in any document under which mane commits to sells products other key concerns are ipr applicable law exclusivity warranty liability the mandatory provision liability cap we must always have a cap of some kind related to the turnover for mane try first to limit to the amount of the order or 50 of the amount of the products invoiced in the year preceding the claim then we can escalate to the amount of products invoiced in the preceding year if the customer continues to push then we should continue to push back arguing for the legitimacy of a cap arguments for the cap mane does not sign supply agreements without a limitation of liability it is standard in our industry and other industries for the component supplier to cap its liability a cap establishes a proportion between the commercial relationship ie revenues achieved and the risk that mane must accept reflects risk sharing rather than risk transfer particularly as the customer inspected the products and accepted them for use mane cannot take on the full liability for the customers products in the market the customer has sole discretion over whether and how to process the products and where and how to market and sell its products that incorporate manes products the consumer market is not manes business and we dont achieve the revenues that correspond to the products in the market which would provide a natural form of insurance for product failures mane does not carry insurance coverage at a sufficient level to protect against liabilities that arise from our customers activities in the consumer marketplace manes prices are structured to reflect the risk that mane is able to take we would need to charge higher prices if we would be liable on our customers products in the consumer market consider that the liability cap bears no relationship to the insurance coverage that mane carries customers and even members of the mane sales group will sometimes take the position that the cap can be higher because of the level of manes insurance but this is not valid exclusions from liability we should always exclude consequential damages as the very minimum under any applicable law under other laws than french laws we must also exclude indirect punitive incidental and special damages punitive damages probably cannot be excluded by contract under certain us states applicable laws but we usually state this anyway indemnity we try to avoid use of hold harmless parties generally do not intend for this to mean something in addition to indemnify but courts will interpret in some meaning to hold harmless that is separate from indemnify indemnity is granted only as to direct damages we also strive to avoid any commitment to defend or to be responsible for costs or attorneys fees ipr exclusivity intellectual property under no circumstances will mane assign or transfer ipr some parties including mane contract managers confuse this with exclusivity further it should be expressly stated that the ipr in and relating to the products their manufacture development or creation including any improvements specifications formulation and documentation belong to mane a customer may argue for joint development terms so that it can share in the ipr but this is almost never truly the case as mane is the party actually developing the ipr exclusivity generally we avoid exclusivity conditions in supply contracts and would only agree upon specified commercial conditions in a separate agreement if exclusivity has to be granted to be validate by business management several conditions must circumscribe it restricted geographic scope limited duration limited to a specified productreference as identified by product code limited to particular application and either a minimum annual purchase requirement or a reciprocal commitment by the customer to purchase its needs for this flavor fragrance in this application exclusively from mane applicable law and jurisdiction arbitration specify governing law and exclusive jurisdiction for resolution of disputes us 1 ohio hamilton county 2 new york southern district of new york 3 delaware no to california europe 1 france 2 switzerland geneva asia 1 france 2 hong kong 3 singapore exception contracts between ptmi indonesian parties to be governed by the laws of republic of indonesia and must be submitted to bani arbitration governing law and jurisdiction should align in us for instance it is probably not advisable to specify a california court may hear the case but should apply new york laws we try for order shown below we assert that we always seek neutral laws and jurisdiction with our customers if we cannot get our own home laws arguing that the customer should not be privileged with a home court advantage arbitration we generally try to avoid mandatory arbitration main advantage confidentiality main disadvantage expensive especially when we contract with much bigger companies in the us more particularly more expensive may be faster than litigation although it probably just depends but it may be better for mane especially if it is a claim against mane andor is particularly complex to not rush to a decision arbitrator is motivated to extend controversy because payment is higher whereas courts are motivated to move claims off docket riskier because it highly depends on quality and experience of the arbitrator arbitrators are known to split the baby meaning that notwithstanding how speculative a claim might be they will say you each have your points and divide the claim counterparties know this and use mandatory arbitration as a way of enhancing the likelihood of achieving at least some kind of award rules especially in terms of discovery and admission of evidence are more permissive than in standard litigation needs to be organized in the arbitration clause no appeals possible there seems to be greater right for the arbitrator to make a subjective determination rather than being bound by precedent in quite the same way that a court would be product specifications inspection warranty product specifications necessary definition and inspection specifications manes specifications technical data sheets govern if the customer argues we can accept mutually agreedupon specifications in any case customers specifications must be validated and agreed in writing by mane to be applicable time limit for inspection we must always state a time limit for the customers inspection of the products for obvious patent defects we start at 5 days next is 10 days then we might go to 10 working days or 14 days anything longer is too much to accept remedies and warranties for nonconformity claims for defects defects noticeable upon unloading shortages excess or apparently damaged products must be notified to the carrier and mane within 3 days maximum other defects specify a time limit to notify of a claim for defect whether patent or latent after discovery and generally should insist on a maximum of 5 days after discovery there shouldnt be argument on why the customer would require a much longer period to notify mane of a discovered defect manes acknowledgment of nonconformity we cannot accept that the customer unilaterally decides that the products are defective it must be proven defective our preferred approach 1 customer files its claim with mane 2 mane inspects onsite or receives a sample to inspect 3 if mane confirms the claim a remedy is followed but if mane disputes the claim an independent lab agreed upon by the parties makes the determination consequences of nonconformity the customer may not send the products back to mane without manes consent the customer cannot be entitled to cancel the order or charge a fee remedies for nonconformity if mane acknowledges the claim mane will either replace the product or reimburse the amounts paid in respect of the defective nonconforming product this is offered as the sole compensation or sole remedy if the customer insists and strongly objects to this as the sole remedy we can withdraw but we will not accept that the customer expressly reserves the right to invoke rights in addition to one of these remedies warranties mane should only warrant that the products will comply with the specifications the warranty is linked to the time limit for claims but could be made for the shelf life stated by mane if unlimited duration is required this is the maximum that we can accept we will also warrant to compliance with applicable laws and regulations although we should probably avoid further warranting to industry standards these are the sole warranties the warranties do not extend to defects that result from the customers improper storage handling or use including such that does not conform to the specifications andor manes instructions we do not warrant free from defects defects is ambiguous and subjective term we expressly exclude the warranties of merchantability and fitness for the particular purpose if the customer insists on fitness for the purpose we can accept provided it is stated that such specific purpose must have been delivered in writing by the customer we resist as much as we can to warranty against infringement if it becomes a dealbreaker not to warrant that the products do not infringe upon third party ipr then we strive for i to the best of manes knowledge and ii that the warranty applies only to manes products as such or in themselves and ensure we are excluding the possibility of a warranty as to manes product in application ie manes product after customers processing or combination with something else ordering delivery process order mane must confirm an order we usually offer three working days better five for europe for it to be binding upon such acceptance the order is a contract binding upon both parties and may not be cancelled mane should implicitly reserve the right to reject orders but if the customer resists the possibility of mane having the right to turn down orders then we can accept to state that mane may not reject orders except if the order states a quantity that is so substantially large that we cannot produce to that level or upon the leadtime asserted or if the order includes nonagreed terms if the customer strongly insists upon the right to cancel open orders we can sometimes accept but strictly upon the condition that mane has not begun production of the goods under the order forecasts either binding on both or binding on neither mane cannot accept to be contractually bound to produce to forecasts if the customer is not obliged to purchase accordingly better not to mention in the contract any forecast from the customer if the customer has no intention to be bound by it if the parties will have a mutually binding forecast manes supply agreement template provides guidelines on requirements flexibility rules of rolling forecast stock if the customer requires mane to hold stock it should be set up in a separate stock keeping agreement this independent contract will impose obligations on the customer to ensure the stock is purchased delivery mane specifies the delivery leadtime on an exw basis meaning leadtime until we place the products at the disposal of the customer at manes premises not cleared for export and not loaded we prefer selling our products on an fca mane production facility basis as per icc 2010 incoterms meaning delivery occurs when we load the goods on the means of transport provided by the carrier at manes premises we strive to avoid penalties for delays or quantity defects if from the business perspective we cannot reject the principle of such penalties for delayed delivery or quantity defects penalties must be negotiated as follows penalty calculation must be clearly defined in the contract and can only apply to product defects or delayed delivery penalty requirement penalties must only apply to late deliver or product defect never more than 10 the total associated sale value no more than 2 per week delivery is delayed mane requires 30 day right to object penalty must be expressly stated as liquidated damage and exclusive remedy strive to prevent customer right to cancel method of paymentdeduction from future invoices must be spelled out we also strive to avoid time is of the essence because then ontime delivery becomes a material condition and since delays do occur it can be a big risk area any provisions on transport and delivery must align with the agreedupon incoterm also risk of loss is determined by the applicable incoterm transfer of title our starting point is transfer at time of full payment for the goods but if the customer argues we can generally accept title transfer upon delivery financial conditions prices we cannot accept to refer to the order to determine the prices the prices should either be in the supply agreement itself or in a separate offer sent by mane applicable icc 2010 incoterm to be specified preferred fca mane production facility price changes prices are only locked during a validity period stated by mane and after such time mane can update the prices at its discretion during the price validity period mane should reserve the right to update prices in case of a substantial rise in the cost of the raw materials hardship clause in respect of price changes during the validity period we argue that such fluctuations in raw material prices are out of our control and we must avoid being bound to continue to honor contracts at existing prices if becomes prohibitively expensive to sell the products considering that our customers are other businesses they should understand this fundamental economics precept and acknowledge that they would likewise not want to be prevented from passing on additional costs they incur in their own sourcing payment payment terms 30 45 or 60 days from date of invoice anything longer than 60 days is invalid in europe in asia mane might accept a period up to 90 days but should be confirmed first by local management terms run strictly from date of invoice not receipt of invoice or receipt of goods we state no discount is granted for early payment unless management has expressly approved a discount late payments we try to state that mane reserves the right to suspend further delivery of products until all overdue payments are collected we also sometimes state that overdue payments bear interest per applicable laws although if applicable law like french law entitles mane to charge interest then it seems unnecessary to require the mention of this implicit right set off some customers include a clause entitling it to set off amounts that it asserts mane owes to it against payments due to mane generally we reject these clauses if the customer insists then we state that mane must first validate the amount that the customer claims that mane owes to it it should not often be the case that mane owes the customer money anyway mane contracting party the contracting party to a supply agreement among the mane entities must be the invoicing mane company all mane companies are invoicing except as follows asia mane korea is not invoicing emea only the following companies on top of vmf are invoicing as follows only the following products ice cream flavors and mixes former gelcrem products and products manufactured in rubi all other sales in emea are invoiced from vmf miscellaneous legal entity confirm the entity is indeed an active registered entity in a certain jurisdiction it is generally best to state the companys jurisdiction and principal physical address recitals if the contract contains a preamble including whereas clauses it is advisable to avoid placing operative terms in this section as this is generally regarded as the place to set the table for the contract rather than begin establishing binding contractual conditions sometimes terms are defined in the preamble which is usually okay since their use occurs in the operative part of the contract applicable documents check for all references to the applicability of an external document eg supplier expectations code of conduct etc all external documents must be submitted to the contract review procedure including review by legal and in some cases eg specifications should be attached as exhibits to the contract general terms conditions of both parties are excluded purpose it is prudent to state the purpose of the contract which should be to establish the terms and conditions for manes sale and the customers purchase of the goods identified to the contract further we generally should state that the products are intended to be integrated into the customers own products and may not be resold as is provided to a mane competitor or repackaged for distribution to third parties make sure that agreement is a supply contract as some customers attempt to consider mane as a toll manufacturer or service provider confidentiality it is generally advisable to state that the parties will keep technical and commercial information confidential for instance the customer may learn things about manes pricing cost inputs although this is not something the business should be disclosing and administrative information be watchful if we have an existing cda with the customer however as we may need to specifically state that the cda applies particularly so we dont inadvertently supersede the cda by including confidentiality obligations here force majeure mane cannot have liability of any kind in case of true force majeure circumstances we can accept that the customer may terminate the agreement with immediate effect if the force majeure condition persists for more than 90 days it is advisable to state periods of time in either days or years because a month can be more ambiguous does it mean 30 days 31 days 28 days because of four sevenday weeks it could also arguably be interpreted to mean full calendar months must elapse eg if the contract is effective july 10th and specifies some right accrues after 3 months perhaps all of august september and october ie 3 months must pass probably what is meant is the right occurs on october 10th but using 90 days just avoids all that interpretation term it is probably prudent to state a term anywhere from 1 to 5 years depending on the circumstances and managements opinion we can structure to automatically renew or renew only upon mutual agreement in any case the prices if mentioned in the agreement must be valid for the price validity period only termination termination of the supply agreement does not end the customers obligation to fulfill its purchase commitment under outstanding orders we generally seek a thirty day cure period for termination due to default assignment no assignment without consent generally we want to have the ability to negotiate separately with a different party amendment state that amendment is possible only upon mutual written agreement no waiver state that failure to insist upon strict compliance does not constitute a waiver severability state that if a provision is held invalid or unenforceable the other provisions are not affected and only the offending provision is excluded some counterparties instead state that the offending provision is to be construed to most closely approximate the parties intent while taking a legally valid form it is fine as an alternative entire agreement state that the contract constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes previous agreements confirm that this is the case and there arent active agreements that we want to keep but could be impacted by this contract signatures mane prefers wet signatures when feasible however situations will arise where an electronic signature is required due to counterparty demands or practicalities of the situation in these situations a variance from the wet signature requirement may be granted by the assigned legal counsel on a casebycase basis subject to the requirements of this section in order for mane to accept an electronic signature the agreement must be governed by laws that allow for electronic signatures to be binding on the parties the signature itself must be validated to both european union and local requirements this means that the signature must use twofactor authentication or a digital certificate meeting the requirements of the eidas regulation the electronic signature services selected by many mane counterparties do not comply with these requirements in order to facilitate the collection of compliant signatures mane has contracted with docusign to provide a platform for collecting and validating electronic signatures if a contract is approved for electronic signature and the counterparty does not provide a compliant method of signing the contract then the mane contract manager shall request the regional docusign account holder to generate an electronic envelope containing the document the contract manager will supply the person generating the envelope with the name title and email address of the signer in order to meet eu electronic signature requirements the signer will either have to supply their mobile phone number to the mane contact to receive an sms password or obtain a digital certificate at their own expense originals require that the counterparty execute two originals so that each party may receive its own original hard copy if the signatures are not to be electronic we may accept to language that specifies a facsimile or electronic copy qualifies as an original provided we make it clear to the counterparty that we nevertheless require to receive a hard copy original individual signers the parties should have authorized representatives execute beware of duly authorized and make sure it is the case theoretically counterparty might be able to avoid a contract if it can successfully claim that an unauthorized employee entered into a commitment nevertheless it is helpful to keep in mind that we should be looking for individuals with appropriate titles as the signatories when french laws are applicable in case of doubt on the capacity of the signatory to sign the contract in the name and on behalf of the company the following is to be sent in an email to the counterparty by mane contract
