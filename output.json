    "context": "A patent represents an exclusive right granted to an inventor or applicant for an invention, which can be either a product or a process. Generally, an invention provides a new way of doing something or offers a novel technical solution to a problem. Examples of such inventive creations include a diverse range of innovations, such as a new manufacturing process for seamless capsules, the discovery of a novel fragrance molecule, or the development of a unique composition that mitigates the bitterness of high-intensity sweeteners. The essence of patent protection lies in prohibiting the commercial making, usage, distribution, or sale of the patented invention without the explicit consent of the patent owner. This exclusive right, granted by the patent, empowers the owner to control and exploit the invention for a limited period. Enforcement of patent rights typically occurs through legal recourse in courts, where the patent owner can seek remedies against instances of patent infringement. In most legal systems, these courts possess the authority to issue injunctions or orders to halt activities that infringe upon the patented invention. Conversely, a third party may challenge the validity of a patent through legal means. If successful, a court may declare the patent invalid, thereby revoking the exclusive rights conferred by the patent. Such challenges can arise due to various reasons, including claims of prior art, lack of novelty or non-obviousness, insufficiency of disclosure, or failure to meet patentability criteria established by the law.",

A few exemplary inventions include 1) a new process for making seamless capsules, 2) a new fragrance molecule, or 3) a new composition that blocks bitterness taste of high intensity sweeteners. Patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owners consent. Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop patent infringement. Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party."

    "context": "For an invention to qualify for patent protection, it typically needs to meet several fundamental conditions. Firstly, it must be industrially applicable or useful, demonstrating practical functionality or utility in its application. Secondly, the invention must exhibit novelty, which implies that it introduces a new characteristic or feature that isn't part of the existing body of knowledge within its particular technical field. This existing knowledge is known as 'prior art' and serves as the benchmark against which the novelty of the invention is assessed. Thirdly, the invention should involve an inventive step, which means it must not be obvious to a person with average knowledge in the relevant technical field. This 'inventive step' or non-obviousness distinguishes the invention from routine developments or modifications. Additionally, the subject matter of the invention must be considered 'patentable' according to the specific patent laws of the country or jurisdiction. Certain categories such as scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods, or methods of medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) might not be eligible for patent protection in many countries. For instance, abstract ideas like Einstein's equation E=mc^2, natural laws like gravity, or naturally occurring phenomena (such as a chemical compound found in nature) are generally not patentable. However, specific applications or practical uses derived from these concepts could potentially be considered for patent protection, emphasizing the importance of the inventive application or practical implementation of these underlying principles",
    "question": "What is patentable?",
    "answer": "An invention must, in general, fulfill the following conditions to be protected by a patent. 1. Industrially applicable (useful): It must be of practical use. 2. New: It must show an element of novelty, meaning some new characteristic that is not part of the body of existing knowledge in its particular technical field. That body of existing knowledge is called prior art. 3. Inventive (not obvious):  It must show an inventive step that is not obvious or routine by a person with average knowledge of the technical field. The subject matter of the invention must also be accepted as patentable under the patent laws of a given county. In many countries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods or methods of medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) are not generally patentable. For example abstract ideas (Einstein's equation E=mc2), laws of nature (gravity), or natural occurring phenomena (a chemical found in nature) are not patentable, but specific applications of these things could be patentable."

In regional patent systems, an applicant can seek protection for their invention in one or more countries, and it is up to each individual country to decide whether to grant patent protection within their borders based on their national patent laws and regulations. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) administers the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which streamlines the process for international patent applications. The PCT allows for the filing of a single international patent application that holds the same legal effect as separate national applications filed in the countries designated by the applicant. However, it's important to note that while the PCT simplifies the initial filing procedure by consolidating the application process, obtaining a patent in a specific PCT member nation still requires filing and prosecuting the patent application according to the regulations and requirements of that particular country.",

Under such regional systems, an applicant requests protection for an invention in one or more countries, and each country decides whether to offer patent protection within its borders. The WIPO-administered Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides for the filing of a single international patent application that has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries.

This authorization typically takes the form of a license granted by the holder. The specific definition and elements of patent infringement may differ based on jurisdiction, yet it commonly involves the unauthorized use or sale of the patented invention. Notably, in numerous countries, the act of infringement necessitates a commercial use or a commercial purpose related to the patented invention. The delineation of the patented invention's scope or the level of protection it receives is articulated within the claims stipulated in the granted patent. Essentially, these claims serve as a public notice, elucidating what actions are prohibited without the explicit consent of the patent holder. It's crucial to understand that patents are territorial in nature, meaning that infringement can only occur in a country where the patent is actively in force and recognized. This territoriality principle underscores the localized nature of patent protection and the confines within which infringement can transpire",

Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license. The definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction, but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention. In many countries, a use is required to be commercial (or to have a commercial purpose) to constitute patent infringement. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent.

This is the situation where a court not designated in an exclusive choice-of- court agreement has been seised of proceedings and the designated court is seised subsequently of proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. In such a case, the court first seised should be required to stay its proceedings as soon as the designated court has been seised and until such time as the latter court declares that it has no jurisdiction under the exclusive choice-of-court agreement. This is to ensure that, in such a situation, the designated court has priority to decide on the validity of the agreement and on the extent to which the agreement applies to the dispute pending before it.
