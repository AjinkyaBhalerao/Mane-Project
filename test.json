This information is crucial and must be meticulously outlined in the Patentability Study Request Form to accurately reflect each contributor's involvement.While the majority of patent laws globally lack a precise definition of an 'inventor,' it is universally acknowledged that an inventor is someone who has contributed to the conception of a significant aspect of the inventive features--elements that are novel and/or non-obvious--comprising the invention.Conception, the linchpin of inventorship, can be described as the formation of a definite and lasting idea in the mind of an inventor, representing the complete and operative invention as it is later translated into practice. Since the definition of inventions is established by the claims, an inventor must be able to identify at least one element within a claim that they conceived. Furthermore, this claim element(s) must be one of the inventive aspects, either novel or non-obvious.If required, the project leader might be asked to provide evidence of each individual's contribution. This could include laboratory notebook pages or reports demonstrating the conception of at least one inventive element outlined in the claimed invention. These evidential documents play a crucial role in supporting claims of inventorship and the contribution of each involved party towards the creation and development of the patented invention",

Accordingly, specific details characterizing each contributor's work on the project must be detailed in the Patentability Study Request Form.While most, if not all, patent statutes around the world fail to provide a precise definition of inventor, it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features (i.e., novel and/or non-obvious) of the invention. Conception, which is the key to inventorship, may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice. And because inventions are defined by the claims, an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that (s)he conceived. Additionally, those claim element(s) must be one of the inventive (novel or non-obvious) elements.If requested, the project leader may be required to submit evidence of contribution for each person, e.g., laboratory notebook pages or reports, showing the conception of at least one inventive element of the claimed invention."

In order to keep this mapping of personal data processed by the Mane Group up to date, the participation of each department and each subsidiary in the inventory, declaration and updating of processing operations is fundamental. It is therefore up to each service or subsidiary, through its DP Coordinator, to transmit its personal data processing registration to the DPO at the address dpo@mane.com, using the validation procedure for the processing of personal data file (as an attachment for reminder).",
