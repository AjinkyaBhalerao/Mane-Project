context: "Preferably, the language of the laboratory notebook is English, but French or Spanish may be acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the Mane Innovation center. The information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet, dated (using two digits for the day, at least three letters to uniquely identify the month, and four digits for the year, e.g., 20 MAY 2017 or 05 NOV 2017), and referenced with its company project name or number and/or an internal reference specific to the researcher. The recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the pages of the notebook, respecting the full width of the pages. The insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided, as information may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning. Recording data can also be carried out by means of inserting preprinted information in the notebook (for example, typed reports, diagrams, diagrams, output datum of equipment of analysis, photographs, etc.). The preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of the page, nor cover any information already entered on the page. Transparent tape or other adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface. For two successive inserts, the second must be affixed below the other (or on two successive pages) and not side by side. Each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both the writer and the witness (each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between the insert and the support page). Other than the aforementioned dates and signatures, no other handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted."
question: What are the general rules regarding the form of information in a laboratory notebook?
answer: Information in a laboratory notebook should preferably be in English, dated, and referenced with the project name or number. Handwritten entries must be made directly on the lines, avoiding the internal margin. Handwritten information should be recorded on designated lines, avoiding the internal margin to facilitate scanning. Amendments can be made in unmarked sections on the same page or on subsequent pages, with clear indications. Preprinted information may be inserted, taped or glued, below each other, with signatures and dates. No additional handwritten annotations on inserts are allowed. If needed, annotations should be made on the original preprinted copy, photocopied, and then attached to the notebook. Not all data needs to be integrated; large datasets can be archived separately, referencing file numbers. Additionally, photographs or digitized reproductions may substitute for original experimental materials in certain cases, such as chromatography plates or gels.

context: "If a protocol has already been previously described, in the same or different laboratory notebook, it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry. Rather, it is sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity, i.e., the laboratory notebook number and page(s) concerned along with the name of its author. All modifications, changes, or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described. Referencing scientific publications or books is permissible if identified unambiguously using a full bibliographical citation.  It is possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording
standard laboratory or testing procedures and protocols, abbreviations, etc., and then make
an appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook."
question: Is it necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry if a protocol has already been described in a previous laboratory notebook?
answer: No, it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry if a protocol has already been described in a previous laboratory notebook. It is sufficient to reference the previous occurrence with specificity, including the laboratory notebook number, page(s), and the name of the author. Any modifications, changes, or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described.

question: What are the duties of the author in maintaining a laboratory notebook?
answer: The author is responsible for meticulously maintaining a dated and signed record in the laboratory book. Each completed page must bear the author's signature, and any errors or crossed-out entries must be promptly dated and signed. Corrections should be made below the identified error or on a subsequent page with a proper reference. The author should avoid inserting information in the corners of pages not yet countersigned by a witness. Unused lines or space at the page bottom should be marked with a "Z," and a witness must sign each page within four weeks of its completion to certify the accuracy of the recording. No new information can be added to pages already signed by a witness.
