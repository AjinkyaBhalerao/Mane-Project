Jurisdiction and address are useful, but not essential. Need to check which Mane entity is/are involved in the disclosure (and receipt) of confidential information.\\n\\nDefine the “Subject Matter” or “Purpose.”  Correspond with the Mane contract manager if it is unclear and the Mane contract manager did not properly define it in the Register entry.\\n\\nBroader language gives the parties more flexibility, and avoids the possibility of the parties disclosing CI that would not be covered under narrower “subject matter.”\\n\\nNarrower language provides more control over the CI flow, and avoids ambiguity about the scope of the CDA.\\n\\nAs a rule, subject matter / purpose must be specified and detailed as much as possible\\nWith customers or prospects, make sure it is connected to business with Mane / supply of products by Mane, i.e. that Mane CI cannot be used by counterparty for another purpose than within the framework of business relationship with Mane.\\nSpecify an effective date, or state that the CDA becomes effective on the date of last signature.\\n\\nDefine “Confidential Information.”  If Mane is disclosing (BI, U, UD), it should include formulae, specifications, manufacturing process data, sample materials, know-how and documentation and business information legitimately regarded as proprietary.\\n\\nDefine the “discloser” or “disclosing party” to apply to both Mane and the counterparty (BI) if it is not the case in the counterparty proposal and if Mane contract manager confirms Mane has CI to cover. If Mane contract manager declares in writing that Mane has no CI to cover and will not disclose CI under the CDA, the CDA will remain an OTH and it will need to be reminded in writing internally that no CI can be disclosed under the CDA.\\n\\nSpecify that CI does not need to be identified as confidential (or refuse such a statement if mentioned). (BI, U, UD)\\n\\nWe try to avoid requiring that our CI be designated to qualify for protection, but we can accept if the counterparty requires it.  In such case, we must alert the Mane contract manager to this requirement.\\n\\nNote: if Mane turns over CI, but fails to designate it as “confidential” despite the CDA requiring it, then the CI is not protected under the CDA (or any document); accordingly, Mane will have disclosed CI without using reasonable means to ensure it is kept secret (a fundamental precept of U.S. trade secret law).  So even if the counterparty still treats the CI as confidential, Mane has arguably lost the right to claim protection of it, including as to third parties, because we will have put the CI in the hands of another party without protections in place.\\n\\nIf Mane wants the right to share the counterparties’ CI with Mane affiliates, then add such right, and define “Affiliates” by using the definition in Mane’s standard forms.  (BI, OTH)  “Control” must exceed 50%.\\n\\nRefuse sharing of CI with agents, consultants, advisors, or representatives.\\n\\nIn the majority of cases, the counterparty reserves the right to share with these external third parties.  We strike, arguing that (1) the counterparty doesn’t really need to share Mane’s CI with them, (2) Mane loses visibility on who has its CI, and (3) Mane effectively loses control over the CI because we lack privity of contract with the third party. In some cases, Mane can accept to extend the right to sharing with external consultants (although we should require an explanation as to precisely why it is needed), but we would require to add (1) that the counterparty first submit the name(s) of the consultant and obtain Mane’s approval, (2) that the counterparty remains fully obligated toward Mane for any failure of the consultant to observe the restrictions.  Alternatively, Mane might require to sign a separate CDA with the consultant.\\n\\nObserve the different forms that agents can be engaged: (1) counterparty’s agents permitted to share counterparty’s CI directly with Mane; (2) counterparty reserves right to share CI of agents (or even third parties); or (3) counterparty reserves right to share Mane CI with counterparty’s agents.  These three are listed roughly in increasing order of risk to Mane.\\n\\nFor situation (1), we try to avoid, and can usually accept if the counterparty pushes, although we then require that the agent designate the CI as “confidential” and “property of counterparty” in order for it to qualify for protection under the CDA.  We also specify that the counterparty remains liable for its agents actions or omissions that violate the CDA.\\n\\nFor situation (2), it seems it should not usually be valid for the counterparty to claim a need to share third party CI.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'For situation (2), it seems it should not usually be valid for the counterparty to claim a need to share third party CI.  Consider especially that if the third party acted responsibly in relation to its CI, it established confidentiality commitments with Mane’s counterparty, and the counterparty might be violating such obligations by sharing with Mane – a situation we don’t want to be embroiled in.\\n\\nFor situation (3), the comments above apply – we generally reject the counterparty’s right to share Mane CI outside the company, but may be able to accept upon restrictive conditions.\\n\\nSpecify the confidentiality obligations:\\n\\nHold in confidence.\\nRestrict access to employees and Affiliates who need to know for the purpose of the Subject Matter.\\nPrevent disclosure to third parties.\\nUse CI only for the purpose of the “Subject Matter.”\\nUse same standard of care as used for own CI, but no less than reasonable standard.\\nNo copying or reproducing CI, except as necessary to effectuate the purpose of the “Subject Matter.”\\n\\nInclude a non-analysis clause, proscribing reverse engineering of Mane’s samples by the counterparty or any other party at the counterparty’s direction.  We should always insist on this.  In rare cases, counterparties have refused, and then we can probably withdraw provided the Mane team is given very strict instructions that they may not provide sample materials.\\n\\nSome counterparties require a separate Material Transfer Agreement to protect sample materials.  Mane is content with our standard CDA, although we do have an MTA form if the counterparty will reject the full CDA (assuming the counterparty will only be receiving samples and no other forms of CI).\\n\\nSpecify the obligations survive either termination or expiration of the CDA.\\n\\nMany counterparties refuse indefinite survival of obligations.  Mane’s response depends on the particular circumstances.  We can argue for survival because the obligations are negative – i.e., neither party has a continuing obligation to do anything, rather they must only not misappropriate or further disclose CI.  Considering that in practice, parties usually do not formally return or destroy CI belonging to the other party, we want to avoid anyone else having possession of Mane CI with restrictions expiring at the conclusion of some arbitrary survival period.  We can argue further that if we grant them the exception – i.e., the obligations will expire after a defined survival period – then Mane loses confidentiality protection on any CI still in the counterparty’s possession not just as to the counterparty, but as to the world (on the theory that we cannot effectively oblige someone else to treat our information as confidential if we have tacitly allowed a third party to have it without restriction). This being said, since indefinite obligations might also be terminated, which could lead to Mane being less protected than with a limited survival of obligations, we can accept to limit the survival.\\n\\nIf we withdraw from the “indefinite survival” position, we try for a longer period of perhaps 10 or 20 years, depending on the sensitivity of the CI to be disclosed. For CDA UD, we should not accept less than 20 years.\\n\\nThis issue in particular underscores the value of discretion – i.e., Mane’s employees should not treat a CDA as an opportunity to freely discuss and share anything and everything.  Rather, Mane should still be thoughtful about disclosing only what is really necessary to further a discussion or relationship.\\n\\nDefine the exceptions to CI obligations:\\n\\nCI is already in the receiving party’s unrestricted possession (i.e., without obligations).  We can accept if the counterparty includes “as proven by documentary evidence.”\\n\\nCI is publicly available.\\n\\nCI later becomes publicly available.\\n\\nCI is received on non-confidential basis by third party who has bona fide right to disclose.  We can accept if the counterparty includes “as proven by documentary evidence.”\\n\\nCI is independently developed by the party, its employees, agents or representatives, who have not used or relied upon the CI.  We can accept if the counterparty includes “as proven by documentary evidence.”\\n\\nSome counterparties specify “who have not had access to the CI.”  Mane has used this in its own forms in the past.  It is acceptable, but I think better to avoid because usually Mane is the party performing the R&D, and this could theoretically restrict Mane’s work (insofar as the same individual that independently develops certain CI may also be the same person that has had access to or come into contact with the CI of the counterparty).  Of course the aim is not to try to misappropriate anyone else’s work, but this exception clause does not permit that anyway.\\n\\nCI that is required to be disclosed by judicial order, requirement of governmental agency, or by operation of law.\\n\\nIn respect of this “compulsory disclosure” exception, be mindful that if the counterparty frames these exceptions as outside the definition of “Confidential Information” (rather than exceptions to the confidentiality obligations), a correction should be made either by specifying the exceptions apply to the obligations, or by setting off this particular exception.  It is a subtle point, and important to recognize that simply because a court or agency requires that the counterparty turn over certain Mane CI, it does not convert Mane CI to non-confidential.  Rather, the counterparty is simply excused from the confidentiality obligations to allow it to comply with the order.\\n\\nState that CI remains the discloser’s property.\\n\\nState that no license or other IP right is granted or implied. Refuse any direct or indirect reference to an assignment of Mane’s IP rights.\\n\\nThis includes statements that information derived from CI must be considered as confidential. Make sure the CI is the information disclosed by a party to the other party (nothing else).\\n\\nRequire return or destruction of CI upon written request.\\n\\nWe try to avoid having this obligation occur automatically upon an event (e.g., end of need for CI, expiration, termination), because that would require that Mane track this requirement, and we don’t have the systems to control for this.

So if we fail to observe the commitment, then Mane would be in breach.  Better to require that the owner make a written request – it remains entirely within their discretion to receive the CI back, and protects us from violating the CDA inadvertently.\\n\\nWe generally want to avoid retention of a copy of CI, but we can likely accept provided it is specified that the copy may be kept only by legal counsel strictly for the purpose of determining continuing obligations (i.e., if Mane would accuse a counterparty of misappropriating its CI, the counterparty wants to ensure it actually has a copy of the source CI that is the subject of the controversy in order to be able to properly defend itself).\\n\\nThe following shall be added in case the counterparty insists “return and destruction of CI”: All Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be destroyed and/or returned by the receiving party to the disclosing party upon written request of the disclosing party and the same shall be confirmed by the receiving party in writing to the disclosing party.\\n\\nState that no assignment of the CDA is permitted without the consent of the other party.\\n\\nState that the CDA does not imply any promise to transact business.\\n\\nState that disclosure is at the discretion of the disclosing party.\\n\\nState that failure to insist upon strict compliance does not constitute a waiver.\\n\\nState that no amendment is permitted without mutual written agreement.\\n\\nState that if a provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions are not affected, and only the offending provision is excluded.\\n\\nSome counterparties instead state that the offending provision is to be construed to most closely approximate the parties’ intent while taking a legally valid form.  This seems fine as an alternative.\\n\\nState that the CDA constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes previous agreements.\\n\\nIf not already known, it is useful to check the Register to confirm there aren’t any prior CDAs.  In some cases, we may need to state that the new CDA does not affect a certain CDA that is meant to continue.\\n\\nSpecify governing law and exclusive jurisdiction for resolution of disputes.\\n\\nU.S.:  (1) Ohio (Hamilton County); (2) New York (Southern District of New York); (3) Delaware.

But if no term will be stated, then it is probably prudent to assert the respective parties’ right to terminate the agreement upon 30 or 60 days’ written notice.\\n\\nIdentify the representatives (and their titles) for notices and correspondence.  We don’t always insist upon adding this, but it can be useful.  The Register nevertheless requires that an individual be nominated.\\n\\nRequire that the counterparty execute two originals (so that each party may receive its own original hard copy).\\n\\nAvoid language that specifies a facsimile or electronic copy qualifies as an original, provided we make it clear to the counterparty that we nevertheless require to receive a hard copy original.\\n\\nThe parties should have authorized representatives execute.\\n\\nTheoretically, a counterparty might be able to avoid a contract if it can successfully claim that an unauthorized employee entered into a commitment.  Nevertheless, it is helpful to keep in mind that we should be looking for individuals with appropriate titles as the signatories.\\nWhen French laws are applicable, in case of doubt on the capacity of the signatory to sign the contract in the name and on behalf of the company, the following is to be sent in an e-mail to the counterparty (by Mane Contract Manager):\\nThank you for confirming that Mr./Mrs…………….. in his/her quality of ………….. is entitled to sign the contract for and on behalf of the company……………before the…….\\nRefuse “joint” and “co-development” language in CDAs.  If the counterparty objects, argue it is beyond the scope of the CDA.  Also, it is generally not the case, and usually not to Mane’s advantage.\\n\\nRefuse any mention of exclusivity.  Exclusivity in supply is entirely outside the scope of the CDA.\\n\\nMANE FORMULAS DISCLOSURES\\n\\nIf Mane will be disclosing formulae(s): It should only be for a toxicological, safety or regulatory compliance purpose, and Mane’s UD template must be used.  The individuals (to be limited in number, and usually restricted to the Regulatory and Quality departments) at the counterparty who will have access to Mane’s formulae must sign the CDA personally.\\n\\nArguments for personal commitments of counterparty’s employees:\\n\\nIt is Mane’s global corporate policy, and has been in place for many years (2009).  It is required if Mane is obliged to share formulae.\\n[For flavors] Mane is a member of IOFI, and adheres to its Code of Practice.  §6.3.2 specifies that IOFI members should require personal commitments.\\nFormulae are among Mane’s most sensitive CI, so it is necessary to use very strict controls to guard against possible misappropriation, which would not simply dilute the value, but end it.  Mane invests considerable resources in R&D, so our counterparties need to respect the measures we must take to protect Mane’s developments.\\nThe counterparty’s internal confidentiality policies and the deontology of regulatory IPs do not provide any remedy to Mane against breach of the secrecy of formulae.\\nThe responsibility of the counterparty’s employees does not change – they would be obliged to observe the confidentiality obligations regardless of their signature.  The personal commitment simply allows Mane to have a recourse directly against the particular individual.\\nThe personal commitment is especially important because it protects Mane when the individual changes employers.\\nAlso, if the individual is instructed by his employer (our counterparty) to act in a way that would violate the CDA, he or she would be personally accountable toward Mane for such breach.\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 2, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'ff7fda2aa7b5e19f01e50784841711a8', 'range': (0, 160)}, {'doc_id': '5f4b18defa36c398ecd5f65d0191c26d', 'range': (6027, 6214)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '7bc3b7ca6c4147518e20fdc9651c89b7'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'What is the difference between a Commercial Representative and a Distributor?\\nA MANE Commercial Representative is appointed to assist for the promotion and sale of MANE’s products (fragrances/ flavours/ ingredients), within a limited territory (country, region, city…) for a specific market (fragrance/ flavour for the food/ cosmetic/ personal care/ home care, and less frequently, in fine fragrance, pharmaceutical, tobacco, pet food, and oral care industries), and grow MANE’s direct sales accordingly. A MANE Distributor is appointed to resell “as is” some of MANE’s products (fragrances/ flavours/ ingredients), within a limited territory (country, region, city…) for a specific market (fragrance/ flavour for the food/ cosmetic/ personal care/ home care, and less frequently, in fine fragrance, pharmaceutical, tobacco, pet food, and oral care industries) to its own customers.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between a Commercial Representative and an Agent?\\nAn Agent is entitled to negotiate selling prices on behalf of the company it represents, while a Commercial Representative is not. MANE does not appoint Agents, only Commercial Representatives.\\n\\nDoes Commercial Representative or Distributor have to meet any sales target?\\nYES, necessarily if it is appointed on an exclusive basis.\\n\\nCan we pay a commission to a Distributor?\\nNO. A Distributor makes profit out of its own sales as opposed to a Commercial Representative which receives a commission-based compensation from MANE for its services.\\n\\nWhat does it mean granting exclusivity to a Distributor or a Commercial Representative?\\nIt prevents MANE from appointing any other Distributor or Commercial Representative of the Products in the Territory in the Market.\\n\\nCan MANE determine the selling price of MANE products from a Distributor?\\nNO. Distributor must remain free to establish its prices and discounts for the Products and related services, with the goal of maximizing the competitiveness of the products and preserving the reputation of MANE. At MANE’ request, the Distributor will inform MANE about these prices and discounts and any planned change thereof.\\n\\nCan we conclude a single agreement covering both Flavour and Fragrance segment for the same Commercial Representative or Distributor?\\nIt is always advisable to have two agreements for two different segments (flavour and fragrance) for the same Commercial Representative or Distributor. This gives the advantage of termination rights to MANE. If Commercial Representative or the Distributor is unable to meet the sales target for flavour but achieve the target for fragrance, then MANE can terminate the flavour agreement only and retain the fragrance agreement.\\n\\nWhy do we need to exclude certain customers from the scope of Commercial Representation or Distribution agreement?\\nThe customers excluded from the scope of a Commercial Representation or Distribution agreement are MANE reserved customers who pursue their existing business relationships directly with MANE without compensation for a Commercial Representative and cannot be considered Distributor’s own customers. The list of such excluded/reserved customers should be reviewed/updated by MANE and the Commercial Representative or Distributor at the end of each calendar year and modified as the case maybe through an amendment to the Agreement.\\n\\nCan a Commercial Representative/ Distributor use MANE’s trademark?\\nCommercial Representative cannot use MANE’ trademark without MANE’s prior written approval.\\nDistributor has no rights connected with MANE trademark other than those which are strictly necessary to the marketing and sale of the products.\\n\\nCan a Commercial Representative/ Distributor further sub-contract?\\nNO, sub-contracting is excluded.\\n\\nWhat information do we need to provide to Legal & IP Department?\\nAfter you determine the form of contract, you will be required to fill in and send the request form with complete information to Legal & IP Department to provide you the contract draft.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'What is the purpose of the commercial contract review\\xa0process?\\nThe contract review process provides for the conditions of verification and modifications of agreement proposals concerning the Mane Group. The purpose of this process is to make sure Mane actually wants and can comply with the terms and conditions offered/submitted to it, and that such terms and conditions are compliant with Mane’s policies and operating methods. The Legal & IP Department proceeds with the final review of the concerned document based on the feedbacks of each concerned department at Mane.\\n\\nWhat kinds of documents are concerned?\\nAll draft agreements or commercial terms sent by our customers, suppliers, trading partners, other than a mere order, that intend to bind Mane to comply with conditions or requirements.\\n\\nExamples include supply agreements, purchase agreements (products or services), development agreements, research agreements, partnerships, etc.\\n\\nAs soon as (i) two Mane internal departments or more are concerned and (ii) the document must be signed by Mane, it shall be subject to the contract review process. Only Mane’s Legal & IP Department is permitted to draft agreements. Any draft agreement written by a Mane collaborator outside the Legal & IP Department cannot receive the proper contract review process. Without exception, any and all contract needs, shall be submitted to the Legal & IP Department specifying the details, background and, if needed, the whys and wherefores of the project, by using the standard forms accessible here through this link if applicable.\\n\\nWhat kinds of documents are not concerned?\\nThe contract review process does not apply to confidentiality agreements (cf Mane’s confidentiality policy), product specification files, quality files, delivery terms and conditions, and to commercial contracts from Nestlé group.\\n\\nAny client’s general terms and conditions of purchase shall not be discussed and therefore not be subject to the contract review process, since we systematically reply that Mane’s sales are subject to its general terms and conditions of sales.\\n\\nWho oversees the follow up of the contract review process and what is his/her role?\\nThe Legal & IP Department is NOT in charge of the follow up of this process. It is the Contract Administration Coordinator, who is the person in charge of the relationship with the partner or the customer/supplier. This Coordinator is responsible for the supervision, centralization and coordination of the contract review process as described more precisely in question 5, from its receipt to its possible signature by Mane.\\n\\nWhat are the steps to follow?\\nFirst, the Contract Administration Coordinator must carefully read the agreement in its entirety, in order to identify every element not (i) compliant with Mane’s practices or reality, or (ii) acceptable from an operational standpoint. Consequently, the Contract Administration Coordinator will identify the terms of the contract to be validated by the appropriate department.\\nAfter this examination, the Coordinator shall fill in the «\\xa0Form for commercial contract review », and identify in such form the collaborators from the different Mane departments (one collaborator per department) must validate or modify some parts of the draft agreement.\\nThe Coordinator will email the contract to be reviewed, in an editable version in French, English or Spanish, the completed in form and if any, the documents targeted in the agreement, to every person that shall review the contract (one maximum per department) as identified in the form. The Coordinator will specify in his email a deadline for the receipt of the comments by the operational staff, so that the Legal & IP Department will have reasonable time to review and if necessary, modify the agreement once all comments are received.\\nThe Coordinator follows up regularly the feedbacks received and if necessary, sends a reminder to those who failed to send their feedbacks.\\nThe Coordinator centralizes the feedbacks and sends the comments and consolidated decisions to the Legal & IP Department for a final review of the document. The Legal & IP department sends a modified version of the agreement to the Coordinator, who will send it back to the counterparty.\\nThe Coordinator negotiates with the counterparty, being reminded that certain terms are solely to the Legal &IP Department’s discretion and not left to acceptance by operational staff. The Legal & IP Department cannot contact (or be silently present on a call) the counterparty’s commercial staff without the counterparty’s legal department being present. The Legal & IP Department will not act as the point of contact for Mane, it is solely the responsibility of the Coordinator. If the modifications of the agreement requested by Mane are not all accepted, the points of disagreements shall be reviewed following the same process: validation by the operational staff, followed by the Legal & IP Department’s final review.\\nThe Coordinator is in charge of the signature process of the final agreement as accepted by Mane and the counterparty.\\nMane prefers original “wet ink” signatures when feasible. However, situations will arise where an electronic signature is required due to counterparty’s demands or practicalities of the situation. In these situations, a duly certified electronic signature may be arranged on a case-by-case basis.\\nOnce the agreement duly initialed and signed by the parties, is received by the Coordinator, he must:\\nScan it and keep a digital copy, send it to all the Mane departments concerned by the agreement and to the Legal & IP Department (the Legal Counsel in charge of the review),\\nSend one hard copy of the signed agreement to the Legal & IP Department, and the other hard copy – or others in case of plural parties – to the counterparty, being reminded that it is necessary to have as many original hard copies as there are parties to the agreement(s).\\n\\nWhen should I involve the Legal & IP Department?\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'a8272ab9199eeeb09b636cac5faa4fba', 'range': (5397, 5995)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c59031c89ad1dfe49ded6eaa6775c6f4'}>,\n",

This Introduction gives guidance on the use of, and about\\nthe fundamental principles behind, the Incoterms® 2020 rules.\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n2\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\n\\nI. WHAT THE INCOTERMS® RULES DO\\n4. The Incoterms® rules explain a set of eleven of the most\\ncommonly-used three-letter trade terms, e.g. CIF, DAP, etc.,\\nreflecting business-to-business practice in contracts for the sale\\nand purchase of goods.\\n5. The Incoterms® rules describe:\\n``\\nObligations: Who does what as between seller and buyer,\\ne.g. who organises carriage or insurance of the goods\\nor who obtains shipping documents and export or\\nimport\\xa0licences;\\n``\\nRisk: Where and when the seller “delivers” the goods,\\nin other words where risk transfers from seller to buyer; and\\n``\\nCosts: Which party is responsible for which costs, for\\nexample transport, packaging, loading or unloading costs,\\nand checking or security-related costs.\\nThe Incoterms® rules cover these areas in a set of ten articles,\\nnumbered A1/B1 etc., the A articles representing the seller’s\\nobligations and the B articles representing the buyer’s obliga-\\ntions. See paragraph 53 below.\\n\\nII. WHAT THE INCOTERMS® RULES DO NOT DO\\n6. The Incoterms® rules are NOT in themselves—and are therefore\\nno substitute for—a contract of sale. They are devised to reflect\\ntrade practice for no particular type of goods—and for any.\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '3cfd4f8c186ea4e8b1a72fbd85911526', 'range': (4054, 4240)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '90c24e9ecdcbdd312ba756de64a6e2cc'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The Incoterms® rules are NOT in themselves—and are therefore\\nno substitute for—a contract of sale. They are devised to reflect\\ntrade practice for no particular type of goods—and for any.\\nThey can be used as much for the trading of a bulk cargo of\\niron ore as for five containers of electronic equipment or ten\\npallets of airfreighted fresh flowers.\\n7. The Incoterms® rules do NOT deal with the following matters:\\n``\\nwhether there is a contract of sale at all;\\n``\\nthe specifications of the goods sold;\\n``\\nthe time, place, method or currency of payment\\nof the price;\\n``\\nthe remedies which can be sought for breach\\nof the contract of\\xa0sale;\\n``\\nmost consequences of delay and other breaches\\nin the performance of contractual obligations;\\n``\\nthe effect of sanctions;\\n``\\nthe imposition of tariffs;\\n``\\nexport or import prohibitions;\\n``\\nforce majeure or hardship;\\n``\\nintellectual property rights; or\\n``\\nthe method, venue, or law of dispute resolution in case\\nof such breach.\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u20023\\nPerhaps most importantly, it must be stressed that the\\nIncoterms® rules do NOT deal with the transfer of property/\\ntitle/ownership of the goods sold.\\n8. These are matters for which the parties need to make specific\\nprovision in their contract of sale. Failure to do so is likely to\\ncause problems later if disputes arise about performance\\nand breach. In essence, the Incoterms® 2020 rules are not\\nthemselves a contract of sale: they only become part of that\\ncontract when they are incorporated into a contract which\\nalready exists. Neither do the Incoterms® rules provide the law\\napplicable to the contract. There may be legal regimes which\\napply to the contract, whether international, like the Conven-\\ntion on the International Sale of Goods (CISG);\\nor domestic mandatory law relating, for example, to health\\nand safety or the environment.\\n\\nIII. HOW BEST TO INCORPORATE THE INCOTERMS® RULES\\n9. If parties want the Incoterms® 2020 rules to apply to their\\ncontract, the safest way to ensure this is to make that intention\\nclear in their contract, through words such as\\n“[the chosen Incoterms® rule] [named port, place\\nor point] Incoterms® 2020”.\\n10. Thus, for example,\\nCIF Shanghai Incoterms® 2020, or\\nDAP No 123, ABC Street, Importland Incoterms® 2020.\\n11. Leaving the year out could cause problems that may be\\ndifficult to resolve. The parties, a judge or an arbitrator need\\nto be able to determine which version of the Incoterms® rules\\napplies to the contract.\\n12. The place named next to the chosen Incoterms® rule is even\\nmore important:\\n``\\nin all Incoterms® rules except the C rules, the named place\\nindicates where the goods are “delivered”, i.e. where risk\\ntransfers from seller to buyer;\\n``\\nin the D rules, the named place is the place of delivery and\\nalso the place of destination and the seller must organise\\ncarriage to that point;\\n``\\nin the C rules, the named place indicates the destination\\nto which the seller must organise and pay for the carriage\\nof the goods, which is not, however, the place or port\\nof delivery.\\n13. Thus, an FOB sale raising doubt about the port of shipment\\nleaves both parties uncertain as to where the buyer must\\npresent the ship to the seller for the shipment and the trans-\\nport of the goods—and as to where the seller must deliver the\\ngoods on board so as to transfer risk in the goods from seller\\nto buyer. Again, a CPT contract with an unclear named\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n4\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\ndestination will leave both parties in doubt as to the point\\nto which the seller must contract and pay for the transport\\nof the goods.\\n14. It is best to avoid these types of issues by being as geographi-\\ncally specific as possible in naming the port, place\\nor point, as the case may be, in the chosen Incoterms® rule.\\n15.

DELIVERY, RISK AND COSTS IN THE\\nINCOTERMS®\\xa02020\\xa0RULES\\n16. A named place or port attached to the three letters, e.g. CIP\\nLas Vegas or CIF Los Angeles, then, is critical in the workings\\nof the Incoterms® 2020 rules. Depending on which Incoterms®\\n2020 rule is chosen, that place will identify either the place\\nor port at which the goods are considered to have been\\n“delivered” by the seller to the buyer, the place of “delivery”,\\nor the place or port to which the seller must organise the\\ncarriage of the goods, i.e. their destination; or, in the case\\nof the D rules,\\xa0both.\\n17. In all Incoterms® 2020 rules, A2 will define the place or port of\\n“delivery”—and that place or port is closest to the seller in EXW\\nand FCA (seller’s premises) and closest to the buyer in DAP,\\nDPU and DDP.\\n18. The place or port of delivery identified by A2 is critical both\\nfor risk and for costs.\\n19. The place or port of delivery under A2 marks the place at\\nwhich risk transfers from seller to buyer under A3. It is at that\\nplace or port that the seller performs its obligation to provide\\nthe goods under the contract as reflected in A1 such that the\\nbuyer cannot recover against the seller for the loss of or\\ndamage to the goods occurring after that point has passed.\\n20. The place or port of delivery under A2 also marks the central\\npoint under A9 which allocates costs to seller and buyer. In\\nbroad terms, A9 allocates costs before the point of delivery\\nto the seller and costs after that point to the buyer.\\n\\nDelivery points\\nExtremes and in-betweens: the four traditional Incoterms®\\nrules groups\\n21.

Versions of the Incoterms® rules before 2010 traditionally\\ngrouped the rules into four, namely E, F, C and D, with E and D\\nlying at extreme poles from each other in terms of the point\\nof delivery and the F and C rules lying in between. While the\\nIncoterms® rules have, since 2010, been grouped according\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u20025\\nto the means of transport used, the old groupings are still\\nhelpful in understanding the point of delivery. Thus, the\\ndelivery point in EXW is an agreed point for collection of the\\ngoods by the buyer, whatever the destination to which the\\nbuyer will take them. At the other extreme in DAP, DPU and\\nDDP, the delivery point is the same as the destination point to\\nwhich the seller or its carrier will carry the goods. In the first,\\nEXW, risk transfers before the transport cycle even starts; in\\nthe second, the D rules, risk transfers very late in that cycle.\\nAgain, in the first, EXW and, for that matter, FCA (seller’s\\npremises), the seller performs its obligation to deliver the\\ngoods whether or not they actually arrive at their destination.\\nIn the second, the seller performs its obligation to deliver the\\ngoods only if they actually arrive at their destination.\\n22. The two rules at the extreme ends of the Incoterms® rules are\\nEXW and DDP. However, traders should consider alternative\\nrules to these two for their international contracts. Thus, with\\nEXW the seller has to merely put the goods at the buyer’s\\ndisposal. This may cause problems for the seller and the buyer,\\nrespectively, with loading and export clearance. The seller\\nwould be better advised to sell under the FCA rule. Likewise,\\nwith DDP, the seller owes some obligations to the buyer which\\ncan only be performed within the buyer’s country, for example\\nobtaining import clearance. It may be physically or legally\\ndifficult for the seller to carry out those obligations within the\\nbuyer’s country and a seller would therefore be better advised\\nto consider selling goods in such circumstances under the DAP\\nor DPU rules.\\n23. Between the two extremes of E and D rules, there lie the three\\nF rules (FCA, FAS and FOB), and the four C rules (CPT, CIP,\\nCFR and CIF).\\n24. With all seven F and C rules, the place of delivery is on the\\nseller’s side of the anticipated carriage: consequently sales\\nusing these Incoterms® rules are often called “shipment” sales.\\nDelivery occurs, for example,\\na) when the goods are placed on board the vessel at the port\\nof loading in CFR, CIF and FOB; or\\nb) by handing the goods over to the carrier in CPT and CIP; or\\nc) by loading them on the means of transport provided by the\\nbuyer or placing them at the disposal of the buyer’s carrier\\nin\\xa0FCA.\\nIn the F and C groups, risk transfers at the seller’s end of the\\nmain carriage such that the seller will have performed its\\nobligation to deliver the goods whether or not the goods\\nactually arrive at their destination. This feature, of being\\nshipment sales with delivery happening at the seller’s end early\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n6\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\nin the transit cycle, is common to the F and the C rules,\\nwhether they are the maritime Incoterms® rules or the\\nIncoterms® rules intended for any mode[s] of transport.\\n25. The F and the C rules do, however, differ as to whether it is the\\nseller or buyer who contracts for or arranges the carriage of\\nthe goods beyond the place or port of delivery. In the F rules,\\nit\\xa0is the buyer who makes such arrangements, unless the parties\\nagree otherwise. In the C rules, this obligation falls to the seller.\\n26. Given that a seller on any of the C rules contracts for or\\narranges the carriage of the goods beyond delivery, the parties\\nneed to know what the destination is to which it must arrange\\ncarriage—and that is the place attached to the name of the\\nIncoterms® rule, e.g. “CIF the port of Dalian” or “CIP the inland\\ncity of Shenyang”. Whatever that named destination is, that\\nplace is not and never becomes the place of delivery. Risk will\\nhave transferred on shipment or on handing over the goods at\\nthe place of delivery, but the contract of carriage must have\\nbeen made by the seller for the named destination. Delivery\\nand destination, then, in the C rules, are necessarily not the\\nsame place.\\n\\nV. INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES AND THE CARRIER\\n27. In the F and the C rules, placing the goods, for example, on\\nboard the vessel or handing them over to, or placing them at\\nthe disposal of, the carrier marks the point at which the goods\\nare “delivered” by the seller to the buyer. Therefore this is the\\npoint at which risk transfers from the seller to the buyer.\\n28. Given those two important consequences, it becomes essential\\nto identify who the carrier is where there is more than one\\ncarrier, each carrying out a separate leg of transport, for\\ninstance by road, rail, air or sea. Of course, where the seller has\\ntaken the far more prudent course of making one contract of\\ncarriage with one carrier taking responsibility for the entire\\ncarriage chain, in a so-called “through” contract of carriage,\\nthe problem does not arise. However, where there is no such\\n“through” carriage contract, the goods could be handed over\\n(where the CIP or CPT rules are used) to a road-haulier or rail\\ncompany for onward transmission to a sea carrier.

The same\\nsituation may arise with exclusively maritime transport where,\\nfor example, the goods are first handed over to a river or\\nfeeder short-sea carrier for onward transmission to an\\nocean\\xa0carrier.\\n29. In these situations, when does the seller “deliver” the goods to\\nthe buyer: when it hands the goods over to the first, second or\\nthird carrier?\\n30. Before we answer that question, a preliminary point. While\\nin most cases the carrier will be an independent third party\\nengaged under a contract of carriage by either the seller or the\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u20027\\nbuyer (depending on whether the parties have chosen a C\\nIncoterms® rule or an F Incoterms® rule), there are situations\\nwhere no such independent third party is engaged at all\\nbecause the seller or the buyer itself will carry the goods sold.\\nThis is more likely to happen in the D rules (DAP, DPU and\\nDDP), where the seller may use its own means of transport\\nto carry the goods to the buyer at the delivery destination.\\nProvision has therefore been made in the Incoterms® 2020 rules\\nfor a seller under the D rules either to contract for carriage\\nor to arrange for carriage, that is to say through its own means\\nof transport: see A4.\\n31. The question asked at paragraph 29 above is not simply a\\n“carriage” question: it is an important “sale” question. The\\nquestion is not which carrier can a seller or buyer of goods\\ndamaged in transit sue under the contract of carriage. The\\n“sale” question is: where there is more than one carrier involved\\nin the carriage of the goods from seller to buyer, at which point\\nin the carriage string does the handing over of the goods mark\\nthe point of delivery and the transfer of risk as between seller\\nand buyer?\\n32. There needs to be a simple answer to this question because the\\nrelationships between the multiple carriers used, and between\\nthe seller and/or the buyer with those several carriers, will be\\ncomplex, depending as they do on the terms of a number of\\nseparate contracts of carriage. Thus, for example, in any such\\nchain of contracts of carriage, one carrier, such as a carrier\\nactually performing a leg of the transit by road, may well act\\nas the seller’s agent in concluding a contract of carriage with\\na carrier by sea.\\n33. The Incoterms® 2020 rules give a clear answer to this question\\nwhere the parties contract on FCA. In FCA, the relevant carrier\\nis the carrier nominated by the buyer to whom the seller hands\\nover the goods at the place or point agreed in the contract of\\nsale. Thus even if a seller engages a road haulier to take the\\ngoods to the agreed delivery point, risk would transfer not at\\nthe place and time where the seller hands the goods over to\\nthe haulier engaged by the seller, but at the place and time\\nwhere the goods are placed at the disposal of the carrier\\nengaged by the buyer. This is why the naming of the place or\\npoint of delivery as precisely as possible is so important in FCA\\nsales. The same situation can arise in FOB if a seller engages a\\nfeeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the vessel engaged\\nby the buyer. A similar answer is provided by Incoterms® 2020:\\ndelivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the\\nbuyer’s carrier.\\n34. With the C rules, the position is more complex and may well\\nattract different solutions under different legal systems. In CPT\\nand CIP, the relevant carrier is likely to be regarded, at any rate\\nin some jurisdictions, as the first carrier to whom the seller\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n8\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\nhands over the goods under A2 (unless the parties have agreed\\non the point of delivery). The buyer knows nothing of the\\ncontractual arrangements made between the seller and the\\nfirst or subsequent carriers, or indeed between that first carrier\\nand subsequent carriers. What the buyer does know, however,\\nis that the goods are “in transit” to him or her—and that\\n“transit” starts as far as the buyer knows, when the goods are\\nput by the seller into the hands of the first carrier. The conse-\\nquence is that risk transfers from seller to buyer at that early\\nstage of “delivery” to the first carrier. The same situation can\\narise in CFR and CIF if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge\\nto take the goods to the agreed port of shipment, if any. A\\nsimilar answer might be suggested in some legal systems:\\ndelivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the vessel\\nat the agreed port of shipment, if any.\\n35. Such a conclusion, if adopted, may seem harsh on the buyer.\\nRisk would transfer from seller to buyer in CPT and CIP sales\\nwhen the goods are handed over to the first carrier. The buyer\\ndoes not know at that stage whether or not that first carrier is\\nresponsible for loss of or damage to the goods under the\\nrelevant carriage contract. The buyer is not a party to that\\ncontract, has no control over it and will not know its terms.\\nYet, despite this, the buyer would end up bearing the risk in the\\ngoods from the very earliest moment of handing over, possibly\\nwithout recovery against that first carrier.\\n36. While the buyer would end up bearing the risk of loss of or\\ndamage to the goods at an early stage of the transport chain,\\nit would, on this view however, have a remedy against the\\nseller.

In essence, the seller should make a contract of\\ncarriage to the destination named under the contract of sale.\\n\\nVI. RULES FOR THE CONTRACT OF SALE AND THEIR\\nRELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CONTRACTS\\n37. This discussion of the role of the carrier in the delivery of the\\ngoods as between the seller and the buyer in the C and F\\nIncoterms® rules raises the question: what role do the\\nIncoterms® rules play in the contract of carriage, or, indeed,\\nin any of the other contracts typically surrounding an export\\ncontract, for example an insurance contract or a letter\\nof\\xa0credit?\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u20029\\n38. The short answer is that the Incoterms® rules do not form part\\nof those other contracts: where incorporated, the Incoterms®\\nrules apply to and govern only certain aspects of the contract\\nof sale.\\n39. This is not the same as saying, however, that the Incoterms®\\nrules have no impact on those other contracts. Goods are\\nexported and imported through a network of contracts that,\\nin an ideal world, should match the one with the other. Thus,\\nthe sale contract, for example, will require the tender of a\\ntransport document issued by the carrier to the seller/shipper\\nunder a contract of carriage and against which the seller/\\nshipper/beneficiary might wish to be paid under a letter of\\ncredit. Where the three contracts match, things go well; where\\nthey do not, problems rapidly arise.\\n40. What the Incoterms® rules say, for example, about carriage or\\ntransport documents (in A4/B4 and A6/B6), or what they say\\nabout insurance cover (A5/B5), does not bind the carrier or\\nthe insurer or any of the banks involved. Thus, a carrier is only\\nbound to issue a transport document as required by the\\ncontract of carriage it makes with the other party to that\\ncontract: it is not bound to issue a transport document com-\\nplying with the Incoterms® rules. Likewise, an insurer is bound\\nto issue a policy to the level and in the terms agreed with the\\nparty purchasing the insurance, not a policy which complies\\nwith the Incoterms® rules. Finally, a bank will look only at the\\ndocumentary requirements in the letter of credit, if any, not at\\nthe requirements of the sales contract.\\n41. However, it is very much in the interests of all the parties to the\\ndifferent contracts in the network to ensure that the carriage\\nor insurance terms they have agreed with the carrier or insurer,\\nor the terms of a letter of credit, comply with what the sale\\ncontract says about ancillary contracts that need to be made\\nor documents that need to be obtained and tendered. That\\ntask does not fall on the carrier, the insurer or the bank, none\\nof whom are party to the contract of sale and none of whom\\nare, therefore, party to or bound by the Incoterms® 2020 rules.\\nIt is, however, in the seller’s and buyer’s interest to try to ensure\\nthat the different parts of the network of contracts match—and\\nthe starting point is the sale contract—and therefore, where\\nthey apply, the Incoterms® 2020 rules.\\nVII. THE ELEVEN INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES—“SEA\\nAND INLAND WATERWAY” AND “ANY MODE(S) OF\\nTRANSPORT”: GETTING IT RIGHT\\n42. The main distinction introduced in the Incoterms® 2010 rules,\\nthat between Rules for any Mode or Modes of Transport\\n(comprising EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, the newly named\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n10\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\nDPU—the old DAT—and DDP), and Rules for Sea and Inland\\nWaterway Transport, (comprising FAS, FOB, CFR and CIF)\\nhas been retained.\\n43. The four so-called “maritime” Incoterms® rules are intended for\\nuse where the seller places the goods on board (or in FAS\\nalongside) a vessel at a sea or river port. It is at this point that\\nthe seller delivers the goods to the buyer. When these rules are\\nused, the risk of loss of or damage to those goods is on the\\nbuyer’s shoulders from that port.\\n44. The seven Incoterms® rules for any mode or modes of transport\\n(so-called “multi-modal”), on the other hand, are intended for\\nuse where\\na) the point at which the seller hands the goods over to,\\nor places them at the disposal of, a carrier, or\\nb) the point at which the carrier hands the goods over to the\\nbuyer, or the point at which they are placed at the disposal\\nof the buyer, or\\nc) both points (a) and (b)\\nare not on board (or in FAS alongside) a vessel.\\n45. Where delivery happens and risk transfers in each of these\\nseven Incoterms® rules will depend on which particular rule is\\nused. For example, in CPT, delivery happens at the seller’s end\\nwhen the goods are handed over to the carrier contracted by\\nthe seller. In DAP, on the other hand, delivery happens when\\nthe goods are placed at the buyer’s disposal at the named\\nplace or point of destination.\\n46.

The order in which the Incoterms® 2010 rules were presented\\nhas, as we have said, been largely retained in Incoterms® 2020\\nand it is important to underline the distinction between the two\\nfamilies of Incoterms® rules so that the right rule is used for the\\ncontract of sale depending on the means of transport used.\\n47. One of the most frequent problems in the use of the Incoterms®\\nrules is the choice of the wrong rule for the particular type\\nof\\xa0contract.\\n48. Thus, for example, an FOB inland point (for example an airport\\nor a warehouse) sale contract makes little sense: what type of\\ncontract of carriage must the buyer make? Does the buyer owe\\nthe seller an obligation to make a contract of carriage under\\nwhich the carrier is bound to take over the goods at the named\\ninland point or at the nearest port to that point?\\n49. Again, a CIF named sea port sale contract where the buyer\\nexpects the goods to be brought to an inland point in the\\nbuyer’s country makes little sense. Must the seller procure a\\ncontract of carriage and insurance cover to the eventual inland\\ndestination intended by the parties or to the seaport named in\\nthe sale contract?\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u200211\\n50. Gaps, overlaps and unnecessary costs are likely to arise—and all\\nthis because the wrong Incoterms® rule has been chosen for\\nthe particular contract. What makes the mismatch “wrong” is\\nthat insufficient regard has been given to the two most\\nimportant features of the Incoterms® rules, features which are\\nmirrors of each other, namely the port, place or point of\\ndelivery and the transfer of risks.\\n51. The reason for the frequent misuse of the wrong Incoterms®\\nrule is that Incoterms® rules are frequently regarded exclusively\\nas price indicators: this or that is the EXW, FOB, or DAP price.\\nThe initials used in the Incoterms® rules are doubtless handy\\nabbreviations for the formula used in the calculation of the\\nprice. Incoterms® rules are not, however, exclusively, or even\\nprimarily, price indicators. They are a list of general obligations\\nthat sellers and buyers owe each other under well-recognised\\nforms of sale contract—and one of their main tasks is to\\nindicate the port, place or point of delivery where the risk\\nis\\xa0transferred.\\nVIII. ORDER WITHIN THE INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES\\n52. All the ten A/B articles in each of the Incoterms® rules are\\nimportant—but some are more important than others.\\n53. There has, indeed, been a radical shake-up in the internal order\\nin which the ten articles within each Incoterms® rule have been\\norganised. In Incoterms® 2020, the internal order within each\\nIncoterms® rule now follows this sequence:\\nA1/B1\\nGeneral obligations\\nA2/B2\\nDelivery/Taking delivery\\nA3/B3\\nTransfer of risks\\nA4/B4\\nCarriage\\nA5/B5\\nInsurance\\nA6/B6\\nDelivery/transport document\\nA7/B7\\nExport/import clearance\\nA8/B8\\nChecking/packaging/marking\\nA9/B9\\nAllocation of costs\\nA10/B10 Notices\\n54. It will be noticed that concerning the Incoterms® 2020 rules,\\nafter recording in A1/B1 the basic goods/payment obligations\\nof the parties, Delivery and the Transfer of risks are moved to a\\nmore prominent location, namely to A2 and A3 respectively.\\n55. The broad sequence thereafter goes:\\n``\\nancillary contracts (A4/B4 and A5/B5, carriage and\\ninsurance);\\n``\\ntransport documents (A6/B6);\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n12\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\n``\\nexport/import clearance (A7/B7);\\n``\\npackaging (A8/B8);\\n``\\ncosts (A9/B9); and\\n``\\nnotices (A10/B10).\\n56. It is appreciated that this change in the order of the A/B\\narticles will take some time—and cost—to become familiar. It is\\nhoped that with delivery and risk now made more prominent,\\ntraders will find it easier to identify the differences among the\\nvarious Incoterms® rules, i.e. the different points in time and\\nplace at which the seller “delivers” the goods to the buyer with\\nrisk transferring to the buyer from that time and point.\\n57. For the first time, the Incoterms® rules are published both in the\\ntraditional format setting out the eleven Incoterms® rules and\\nin a new “horizontal” format setting out the ten articles within\\neach Incoterms® rule under each of the headings listed above\\nin paragraph 53, first for the seller and then for the buyer.\\nTraders can therefore now far more easily see the difference,\\nfor example, between the place of delivery in FCA and the\\nplace of delivery in DAP; or the items of cost which fall on\\na buyer in CIF when compared with the items of cost which\\nfall on a buyer in CFR. It is hoped that this “horizontal” rep-\\nresentation of the Incoterms® 2020 rules will further assist\\ntraders in choosing the Incoterms® rule most appropriate to\\ntheir commercial requirements.\\n\\nIX. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INCOTERMS® 2010 AND 2020\\n58. The most important initiative behind the Incoterms® 2020 rules\\nhas been to focus on how the presentation could be enhanced\\nto steer users towards the right Incoterms® rule for their sale\\ncontract. Thus:\\na) a greater emphasis in this Introduction on making the right\\nchoice;\\nb) a clearer explanation of the demarcation and connection\\nbetween the sale contract and its ancillary contracts;\\nc) upgraded Guidance Notes presented now as Explanatory\\nNotes to each Incoterms® rule; and\\nd) a re-ordering within the Incoterms® rules giving delivery\\nand risk more prominence.\\nAll these changes, though cosmetic in appearance, are in\\nreality substantial attempts on the part of ICC to assist the\\ninternational trading community towards smoother export/\\nimport transactions.\\n59. Apart from these general changes, there are more substantive\\nchanges in the Incoterms® 2020 rules when compared with\\nIncoterms® 2010. Before looking at those changes, mention\\nmust be made of a particular development in trade practice\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u200213\\nwhich occurred since 2010 and which ICC has decided should\\nnot lead to a change in the Incoterms® 2020 rules, namely\\nVerified Gross Mass (VGM).\\n60.

Note on Verified Gross Mass (VGM)—Since 1 July 2016,\\nRegulation 2 under the International Convention for the Safety\\nof Life at Sea (SOLAS) imposed on shippers in the case of the\\nshipment of containers the obligation either to weigh the\\npacked container using calibrated and certified equipment,\\nor to weigh the contents of the container and add the weight\\nof the container when empty. In either case, the VGM is to be\\nrecorded with the carrier. A failure to comply bears the\\nsanction under the SOLAS Convention that the container\\n“should not be loaded onto a ship”: see paragraph 4.2,\\nMSC1/Circ.1475, 9 June 2014.\\nThese weighing operations obviously incur expense and failure\\nmay lead to delay in loading. As this happened after 2010, it is\\nunsurprising that there was some pressure in the consultations\\nleading to Incoterms® 2020 for a clear indication to be given as\\nto who, as between seller and buyer, should bear such\\nobligations.\\n61.

Returning to the changes made by ICC to the Incoterms® 2010\\nrules in the Incoterms® 2020 rules, these are:\\n[a] Bills of lading with an on-board notation and the FCA\\nIncoterms® rule\\n[b] Costs, where they are listed\\n[c] Different levels of insurance cover in CIF and CIP\\n[d] Arranging for carriage with seller’s or buyer’s own\\nmeans of transport in FCA, DAP, DPU and DDP\\n[e] Change in the three-letter initials for DAT to DPU\\n[f]\\nInclusion of security-related requirements within\\ncarriage obligations and costs\\n[g] Explanatory Notes for Users\\n[a] Bills of lading with an on-board notation and the FCA\\nIncoterms® rule\\n63. Where goods are sold FCA for carriage by sea, sellers or\\nbuyers (or more likely their banks where a letter of credit is in\\nplace) might want a bill of lading with an on-board notation.\\n64. However, delivery under the FCA rule is completed before the\\nloading of the goods on board the vessel. It is by no means\\ncertain that the seller can obtain an on-board bill of lading from\\nthe carrier. That carrier is likely, under its contract of carriage,\\nto be bound and entitled to issue an on-board bill of lading\\nonly once the goods are actually on board.\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n14\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\n65. To cater for this situation, FCA A6/B6 of Incoterms® 2020 now\\nprovides for an additional option. The buyer and the seller can\\nagree that the buyer will instruct its carrier to issue an on-board\\nbill of lading to the seller after the loading of the goods, the\\nseller then being obliged to tender that bill of lading to the\\nbuyer, typically through the banks. ICC recognises that, despite\\nthis somewhat unhappy union between an on-board bill of\\nlading and FCA delivery, this caters for a demonstrated need\\nin the marketplace. Finally, it should be emphasised that even\\nwhere this optional mechanism is adopted, the seller is under\\nno obligation to the buyer as to the terms of the contract\\nof\\xa0carriage.\\n66. Does it remain true to say that where containerised goods are\\ndelivered by seller to buyer by handing over to a carrier before\\nloading onto a ship, the seller is well advised to sell on FCA\\nterms rather than on FOB terms? The answer to that question\\nis Yes. Where Incoterms® 2020 have made a difference,\\nhowever, is that where such a seller still wants or needs a bill\\nof lading with an on-board notation, the new additional option\\nin the FCA term A6/B6 makes provision for such a document.\\n[b] Costs, where they are listed\\n67. In the new ordering of the articles within the Incoterms® 2020\\nrules, costs now appear at A9/B9 of each Incoterms® rule.\\nApart from that re-location, however, there is another change\\nthat will become obvious to users early on. The various costs\\nwhich fall to be allocated by various articles within the Inco-\\nterms® rules have traditionally appeared in different parts of\\neach Incoterms® rule. Thus, for example, costs related to the\\nobtaining of a delivery document in FOB 2010 were mentioned\\nin A8, the article under the heading “Delivery Document”, but\\nnot in A6, the article under the heading “Allocation of Costs”.\\n68. In the Incoterms® 2020 rules, however, the equivalent of A6/B6,\\nnamely A9/B9, now lists all the costs allocated by each\\nparticular Incoterms® rule. A9/B9 in the Incoterms® 2020 rules\\nare consequently longer than A6/B6 in the Incoterms®\\n2010\\xa0rules.\\n69. The purpose is to provide users with a one-stop list of costs,\\nso that the seller or buyer can now find in one place all the\\ncosts for which it would be responsible under that particular\\nIncoterms® rule. Items of cost are also mentioned in their home\\narticle: thus, for example, the costs involved in obtaining\\ndocuments in FOB still also appear at A6/B6 as well as at\\nA9/B9. The thinking here was that users interested in\\ndiscovering the specific allocation of documentary costs\\nmight be more inclined to go to the specific article dealing\\nwith delivery documents rather than to the general article\\nlisting all the\\xa0costs.\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u200215\\n[c] Different levels of insurance cover in CIF and CIP\\n70.

In the Incoterms® 2010 rules, A3 of both CIF and CIP imposed\\non the seller the obligation to “obtain at its own expense cargo\\ninsurance complying at least with the minimum cover as\\nprovided by Clauses (C) of the Institute Cargo Clauses (Lloyd’s\\nMarket Association/International Underwriting Association\\n‘LMA/IUA’) or any similar clauses.” Institute Cargo Clauses (C)\\nprovide cover for a number of listed risks, subject to itemised\\nexclusions; Institute Cargo Clauses (A), on the other hand,\\ncover “all risks”, again subject to itemised exclusions. During\\nthe consultations leading to the Incoterms® 2020 rules, the case\\nwas made for moving from Institute Cargo Clauses (C) to\\nInstitute Cargo Clauses (A), thus increasing the cover obtained\\nby the seller for the benefit of the buyer. This could, of course,\\nalso involve an additional cost in premium. The contrary case,\\nnamely to stay with Institute Cargo Clauses (C), was equally\\nstrongly put, particularly by those involved in the maritime\\ntrade of commodities. After considerable discussion within and\\nbeyond the Drafting Group, the decision was made to provide\\nfor different minimum cover in the CIF Incoterms® rule and in\\nthe CIP Incoterms® rule. In the first, which is much more likely\\nto be used in the maritime commodity trades, the status quo\\nhas been retained, with Institute Cargo Clauses (C) as the\\ndefault position, although it is, of course, open to the parties to\\nagree to higher cover. In the second, namely the CIP Incoterms®\\nrule, the seller must now obtain insurance cover complying\\nwith Institute Cargo Clauses (A), although it is, of course, again\\nopen to the parties to agree on a lower level of cover.\\n[d] Arranging for carriage with seller’s or buyer’s own means\\nof transport in FCA, DAP, DPU and DDP\\n71. In the Incoterms® 2010 rules, it was assumed throughout that\\nwhere the goods were to be carried from the seller to the\\nbuyer, they would be carried by a third-party carrier engaged\\nfor the purpose either by the seller or the buyer, depending\\non which Incoterms® rule was used.\\n72. It became clear in the deliberations leading to Incoterms® 2020,\\nhowever, that there were some situations where, although the\\ngoods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer, they\\ncould be so carried without any third-party carrier being\\nengaged at all. Thus, for example, there was nothing stopping\\na seller on a D rule from arranging for such carriage without\\noutsourcing that function to a third party, namely by using its\\nown means of transportation. Likewise, with an FCA purchase,\\nthere was nothing to stop the buyer from using its own vehicle\\nfor the collection of the goods and for their transport to the\\nbuyer’s premises.\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\n16\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\n73. The rules appeared not to take account of these eventualities.\\nThe Incoterms® 2020 rules now do, by expressly allowing not\\nonly for the making of a contract of carriage, but also for\\nsimply arranging for the necessary carriage.\\n[e] Change in the three-letter initials for DAT to DPU\\n74. The only difference between DAT and DAP in the Incoterms®\\n2010 rules was that in DAT the seller delivered the goods once\\nunloaded from the arriving means of transport into a “terminal”;\\nwhereas in DAP, the seller delivered the goods when the goods\\nwere placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means\\nof transport for unloading. It will also be recalled that the\\nGuidance Note for DAT in Incoterms® 2010 defined the word\\n“terminal” broadly to include “any place, whether covered\\nor\\xa0not…”.\\n75. ICC decided to make two changes to DAT and DAP. First, the\\norder in which the two Incoterms® 2020 rules are presented\\nhas been inverted, and DAP, where delivery happens before\\nunloading, now appears before DAT. Secondly, the name\\nof the rule DAT has been changed to DPU (Delivered at Place\\nUnloaded), emphasising the reality that the place of destination\\ncould be any place and not only a “terminal”. However, if that\\nplace is not in a terminal, the seller should make sure that the\\nplace where it intends to deliver the goods is a place where it is\\nable to unload the goods.\\n[f] Inclusion of security-related requirements within carriage\\nobligations and costs\\n76. It will be recalled that security-related requirements made a\\nrather subdued entry into the Incoterms® 2010 rules, through\\nA2/B2 and A10/B10 in each rule. The Incoterms® 2010 rules\\nwere the first revision of the Incoterms® rules to come into force\\nafter security-related concerns became so prevalent in the\\nearly part of this century. Those concerns, and the associated\\nshipping practices which they have created in their wake, are\\nnow much more established. Connected as they are to carriage\\nrequirements, an express allocation of security-related\\nobligations has now been added to A4 and A7 of each\\nIncoterms® rule. The costs incurred by these requirements are\\nalso now given a more prominent position in the costs article,\\nnamely A9/B9.\\n[g] Explanatory Notes for Users\\n77. The Guidance Notes appearing at the start of each Incoterms®\\nrule in the 2010 version now appear as “Explanatory Notes for\\nUsers”. These Notes explain the fundamentals of each\\nIncoterms® 2020 rule, such as when it should be used, when\\nrisk transfers and how costs are allocated between seller and\\nbuyer. The Explanatory Notes are intended (a) to help the\\nuser accurately and efficiently steer towards the appropriate\\nINCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u200217\\nIncoterms® rule for a particular transaction; and (b) to provide\\nthose deciding or advising on disputes or contracts governed\\nby Incoterms® 2020 with guidance on matters which might\\nrequire interpretation.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'What is intellectual property?\\nIntellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected in specific laws, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.\\n\\nWhat are the common types of IP?\\nPATENTS, REGISTERED DESIGNS (or Design Patent), TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS\\n\\nWhat is a patent?\\nA patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new product or way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a technical problem. Patents protect the features and processes that make things work. Patent rights let inventors profit from their inventions. Patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner’s consent.  Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop patent infringement. Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party.\\n\\nWhat is a trademark?\\nA trademark is a distinctive sign or mark, which identifies certain goods or services as those produced or provided by a specific person or enterprise.\\n\\nWhat can be registered as a trademark?\\nWords; Logos; Slogans; Sounds; Colors; Shapes; Smells.\\n\\nWhat is a Registered Design?\\nA design is the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. The design may consist of three-dimensional\\nfeatures, such as the shape or surface of an article, or of two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or color.\\n\\nWhat is copyright?\\nCopyright is the set of exclusive rights granted to the creator of an original work (e.g. a piece of music, song lyrics, films, novels, photographs, paintings, web pages) including the right to copy, distribute and adapt the work. Like all of the other IP rights, these rights can be licensed, transferred and/or assigned.\\n\\nWhat is an intellectual property licensing agreement?\\nA licensing agreement involves the transfer of intellectual property rights, and potentially proprietary knowledge, in return for royalty as revenue from one company or individual to another.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': []}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c8db33ca74dd832b1b62826457eaedb4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'What information is necessary to identify an inventor?\\nThe determination of inventorship is a legal conclusion based on facts.  Accordingly, specific details characterizing each contributor\\'s work on the project must be detailed in the Patentability Study Request Form. While most, if not all, patent statutes around the world fail to provide a precise definition of \"inventor,\" it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features (i.e., novel and/or non-obvious) of the invention. Conception, which is the key to inventorship, may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice. And because inventions are defined by the claims, an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that (s)he conceived. Additionally, those claim element(s) must be one of the inventive (novel or non-obvious) elements. If requested, the project leader may be required to submit evidence of contribution for each person, e.g., laboratory notebook pages or reports, showing the conception of at least one inventive element of the claimed invention.\\n\\nMy colleague and I worked together on the project, who is the inventor?\\nWhen two or more people collaborate in conceiving a claimed invention, then those people are joint inventors. Each joint inventor must be aware of the contribution of the other and each must contribute to the formation of the solution to a problem that is the invention. Thus, joint inventorship is the process by which people cooperate to solve a problem and in which each person makes some mental contribution to the final conception of the solution. The entire inventive concept need not occur to each of the joint inventors and they need not physically work on the project together or at the same time. Nor do their contributions need to be the same or equal. All that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application. Please note that merely being present during a meeting, providing research support, setting up experiments at the instruction of another, analytical testing, or simply instructing others to perform research does not, by itself, indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention.\\n\\nWho is responsible for identifying inventors?\\nPatent Counsel at MANE bears the responsibility, in association with preparing a patent application, to identifying the inventor(s). Consequently, successfully identifying inventor(s) involves assessing the nature of contribution by each person. This assessment is necessary to permit the applicant to meet its legal obligation in most, if not all, of the national patent offices to provide to an accurate listing of inventors on a patent application. Failure to provide an accurate list of inventors may, in some circumstances, compromise the validity and enforceability of the resulting patent. Inadvertently naming or omitting an inventor is generally a correctable error, but intentionally naming or omitting an inventor can result in the patent being found unenforceable against alleged infringers.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': []}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f06194968ae824cfb77e572dd2d1dcf8'}>,\n",

Laboratory Notebook\\n\\n1.1. Functions and objectives\\n\\nResearch and development (R&D) refers to innovative activities toward developing new\\nproducts, processes, or equipment, or improvements in existing products, processes, or\\nequipment.  To that end, all R&D work involving new products, processes, equipment, or\\nmodification of existing products, processes, or equipment must be evaluated to assess\\nnovelty and obviousness (inventive step).  All Mane researchers, engineers, technicians,\\ntrainees, interns, in charge of product or production process development work shall utilize a\\ncompany-issued laboratory notebook to record any R&D work that foreseeably involves the\\ncreation of new, nonobvious, and commercially relevant products, processes, or equipment.\\n\\nThe primary purpose of a laboratory notebook is to preserve and protect intellectual\\nproperty rights in all new and improved products, processes, or equipment by serving as a\\nrecord and archive for all research and development work (ideas, experiments, formulations,\\netc.).  A laboratory notebook, when properly utilized, may be used as legal evidence with\\nrespect to various aspects of the new or improved methods/products, such as conception\\nand/or reduction to practice of an invention and date(s) corresponding thereto, test results,\\nand the like.\\n\\nIn this respect, laboratory notebooks enable inventors:\\n\\uf0a7 To record and provide an accounting of the intellectual and technical progress\\ncorresponding to each project carried out;\\n\\uf0a7 To explain the manner in which an experiment was carried out and how the result(s)\\nof that experiment was obtained, and thus serve as the definitive account of what\\ntranspired, which thereby ensures the reproducibility of the experiment; and\\n\\uf0a7 To ensure the preservation of information which may be useful for both internal and\\nexternal\\ncommunications\\n(e.g.,\\nwriting\\nscientific\\npublications,\\npreparing\\npresentations, drafting of patent applications, transfer of technology, etc.).\\n\\nBy following the steps prescribed herein for their implementation, MANE laboratory\\nnotebooks will possess the authenticity to serve as evidentiary tools in the event of\\nlitigation(s), dispute(s), or claim(s).  Proper implementation of the prescribed procedure will\\ncreate laboratory notebooks that can be used:\\n\\uf0a7 To certify that, on a specified date, the holder possessed the information contained\\ntherein (e.g., experimental results, scientific observation, working hypotheses, etc.);\\n\\uf0a7 To specifically define the information created by the holder, such as working\\nhypothesis, reflections, experimental designs and results, which may assist with\\ndetermining inventorship, establishing invention rights, and providing data for patent\\nfilings; and\\n\\uf0a7 To provide a factual accounting toward the degree of participation (e.g., intellectual\\nand material contribution) of an individual and/or a company in the design of an\\ninvention.\\n\\nAccordingly, a properly documented laboratory notebook makes it possible to capitalize\\non the knowledge and know-how of researchers / laboratories / companies.  As such, they are\\nan essential component of the heritage of V.

Model and storage\\n\\nThe approved laboratory notebook model should be sewn and hardbound, and\\nsubstantially identical for all personnel at a given site.  One suitable example of an approved\\nlaboratory notebook is Boorum & Pease Record Book, Record Ruled, 10-3/8\" x 8-1/8\" Size,\\n300 Pages (21-300-R) or its equivalent.  Each laboratory notebook shall have a unique\\nalphanumerical identifier assigned (further discussed below), either embossed on the exterior\\ncovering or marked in permanent ink on the interior cover.\\n\\nA supply of laboratory books should be maintained by the Director or Vice President\\n(VP) of R&D of the respective R&D/Innovation site.  Each person(s) assigned to a given\\nnotebook is responsible for the safekeeping, maintenance, and archiving thereof.\\n\\n1.3. Attribution and classification\\n\\nThe VP of R&D or Director of the Mane R&D/Innovation site is responsible for creating\\nand maintaining a Laboratory Notebook Log for recording the assignment of laboratory\\nnotebooks to personnel.  The assignment of each laboratory notebook is entered into the\\nLaboratory Notebook Log by associating the laboratory notebook\\'s unique alphanumerical\\nidentifier with at least one individual, who is responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping.\\n\\nA laboratory notebook\\'s unique alphanumerical identifier shall comprise a mixture of\\nletters and numbers.  Letters are used to designate the MANE group company (e.g., MINC\\nfor Mane, Inc. in USA; MSEA for Mane Sea in Singapore; KCOR for KANCOR\\nINGREDIENTS LIMITED in India etc…).

Make entries\\nclear and complete, that someone else could repeat the experiment.\\n2.\\nAvoid erasures.  If an error is made, cross it out and make the correction immediately thereafter.  Cancellations\\nor insertions should be initialed, dated, and explained by an appropriate notation.\\n3.\\nMake sure control page is filled out prior to usage.\\n4.\\nComplete the table of contents as you make entries in the notebook.\\n5.\\nState the object and results of each experiment clearly and concisely.  Give a complete, factual, and self-\\nexplanatory account of the progress of the work and the procedure followed (reference to earlier work done by\\nyourself or another may be accomplished by noting a previous page of the same notebook or the page and\\nnumber of an earlier notebook).  Describe and give quantities of all materials used.  Explain all code numbers\\nand abbreviations.\\n6.\\nAn entry dealing with a conception (invention, idea) must describe the thing conceived.  (Example, whether it is\\na chemical compound, a combination of a compound and a solvent, etc.) as well as the utility for the ting\\nconceived, how it is to be used and the method(s) by which it is to be prepared, including equivalent materials\\nwhich could be used.  Statements with regard to utility should be stated positively.  Work toward practical\\nimplementation of an invention should start as soon as possible in a notebook.\\n7.\\nNegative or deprecatory entries should be avoided.  (Example:  A reaction gives a 2% yield was expected.  Do\\nnot state \"Process does not work\".)  Phraseology which expresses an opinion rather than a positive statement\\nand gratuitous comments should be avoided.  This is not an instruction to omit the conclusion of an experiment\\nwhich had less than the expected results.  Be factual.\\n8.\\nEach day\\'s work should, whenever possible, be started on a separate page with lines drawn down angularly\\nacross the unused portion of the previous page. (This gives legal evidence that additions were not made at a later\\ndate.)  It is permissible, as stated above, to make reference to an earlier page by reciting \"Continued from page\\n…\".  It is extremely important that each page show the date of entry.\\n9.\\nEach page must be signed and dated by the individual who makes the entry and does the work.  In addition, each\\npage must be witnessed (signed and dated), using the notation \"Read and Understood\", preferably on the same\\nday, but at least within one week.  The witness should not be connected with the conception, should not have\\ntaken part in the experimental work performed by another, but should understand the technical filed of the entry.\\nRecord Laboratory Notebook Number and project on each page.\\n10. Where a conception is made by two or more individuals, it need only be entered in the notebook of one, but\\nmust be signed and dated by all the conceivers.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'What is the purpose of a confidentiality agreement?\\nA confidentiality or “non-disclosure” agreement – abbreviated as CDA or NDA – is used to protect confidential and proprietary information.  It requires that the counterparty keep the information secret, prohibits the counterparty from exploiting the information for its economic advantage, and establishes that all ownership rights remain with the original party.\\n\\nWhen is a CDA needed?\\nWhen Mane will share confidential information with another person or entity.  Also, when someone will observe or learn about Mane’s confidential information. Additionally, when any of the parties (MANE and Counterparty) wish to disclose confidential information to each other.\\n\\nWhat is confidential information?\\nConfidential information is usually non-public information for which misappropriation could give a competitor a competitive advantage.\\n\\nWhat are some types of confidential information?\\nFormulas, samples, processes and know-how are common examples.  Others could include: methods, ideas, concepts, techniques, research, experimental work, developments, inventions (whether or not patentable), scientific and clinical information, design details, drawings, diagrams, engineering, specifications, ingredients, chemical composition, recipes, customer or/and supplier data, business records, financial information, legal and/or corporate information, sales data, sales analyses, forecasts, plans (business, staffing, product development, etc.), prices, margins, strategy, equipment, technical specifications incident reports, complaints, claims, business arrangements, contracts, contract terms, origin of products, and reports.\\n\\nWhich MANE entity or affiliate is the contracting party of the CDA?\\nThe legal entity which employs the employees who will be disclosing the information to the counterparty should be the contracting entity.   If several MANE entities are involved, each should be contracting party.\\n\\nWho is responsible for managing the confidentiality agreement with the counterparty?\\nMane’s representative in the relationship with the counterparty is responsible for adherence to the Confidentiality Policy, including the follow-up obligations.  This individual is likewise responsible for being familiar with the rights and obligations of the CDA and ensuring that Mane observes all requirements of the agreement.\\n\\nHow do I register a CDA?\\nEvery CDA – whether using Mane’s template or one received from a counterparty – must be immediately registered in the central register on SharePoint in order to allocate a register ID.\\nEnter the reference ID in the footer of the agreement and mention it in any document used to disclose confidential information, including the sentence \"Confidential information subject to the terms and conditions of contract No. [INCLUDE REFERENCE NUMBER]\".\\n\\nIs the “designated representative” the same as the signatory?\\nNo. The designated representative is the individual who is most directly responsible for managing the relationship and is the contact person for notices. The signatory is the individual authorized to sign the agreement and bind the company.  Sometimes they are the same person, but often they are not.\\n\\nIs it possible to review confidentiality agreements sent by the counterparty?\\nMane’s representative should always seek the use of Mane’s templates. However, when necessary, Mane will consider reviewing the counterparty’s CDA. In that case, it is the responsibility of Mane’s representative to read the entire document before submitting the document to be registered, and to provide Mane Legal & IP Department their comments on the CDA and all necessary information to allow a proper review (Mane entities concerned, subject matter, retroactive effect, duration…).\\n\\nDo I need to involve the Legal & IP Department?\\nConsultation of the Legal & IP Department is not needed only if you use a Mane template and the counterparty signs without amendment.  Legal is not checking the proper fill-in of a Mane template: it must be done by Mane’s representative in the relationship under his/her responsibility. In all other cases – particularly including amendments proposed by the counterparty to Mane’s CDA proposal, or if the counterparty submits its form – you must submit for review by Legal, but not until the agreement is properly registered in accordance with the Confidentiality Policy.\\n\\nWhen completing Mane’s template, how do I define the “Subject Matter”?\\nThe Subject Matter describes the purpose of the exchange of confidential information with the counterparty.  It is especially important to define this properly because it (i) establishes what information is covered (i.e. only information shared that pertains to the Subject Matter is protected under the agreement), and (ii) limits how the other party can use the information (i.e. use of the confidential information is restricted to activities consistent with the Subject Matter). The Subject Matter must be defined precisely as much as possible in order to provide clarity on the confidential information that is to be protected. Example:  The Parties intend to investigate a possible business relationship regarding Mane’s development and proposal of fragrance compositions and delivery systems thereof for integration by Customer into its own hair care products and shall commence mutual discussions relating thereto.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'https://mosscorp.emea.sesam.mane.com/LegalIP/IP/Patents%20useful%20information/\\nHow is a patent application created?\\nAt MANE, the patenting process begins with obtaining approval for a Patentability Study from one of the following committees: ComInnov - Innovation, Valorization and Transfer Committee - SP-DG-001/01 ComSci - Conception, Development and Industrialization Committee ‐ SP‐DS‐001/04\\n\\nWhat information is necessary for initiating a patentability study?\\nThe purpose of a patentability study is to assess the likelihood of obtaining a granted patent having meaningful protection.  Thus, in order to assess patentability of a new product or process, the inventors/contributors must provide patent counsel with specific details of the product or process, including an explanation of the technical problem being solved, successful and unsuccessful experiments, known prior art, and how the new product or process is different from old or known products or processes. After studying the provided details, the new product or process is defined by one or more hypothetical claims, which are then evaluated by comparing the hypothetical claim(s) to the prior art.  Prior art is any evidence (information) that the invention was already publicly known or available, in whole or in part, before the effective filing date of the patent application, and includes publicly available information, such as published patent documents, scientific journal articles, web pages, technical data sheets, etc.\\n\\nWhat happens after a patentability study?\\nAt the conclusion of the patentability study, patent counsel will prepare a final written patentability report, which shall include a description of the invention, the hypothetical claim(s), a listing of the relevant prior art document(s) found in the prior art search, and an analysis as to the novelty and inventiveness of the hypothetical claim(s) vis-à-vis the relevant prior art document(s).  The report will conclude with a recommendation to proceed (or not) with the preparation and filing of patent application. Because the patenting system requires disclosure of the technical details of the invention in exchange for a chance at obtaining patent rights, there is a risk of disclosure without any patent rights. As such, in some instances and prior to making a favorable recommendation, R&D may be asked to perform additional testing or experiments to enhance MANE\\'s chances for obtaining a granted patent.\\n\\nWhat is involved with preparing a patent application?\\nThe process for preparing a patent application involves a collaboration between patent counsel and the inventor(s). Patent counsel will generally begin the process by preparing a set of claims describing the metes and bounds of the invention, and then build the remaining sections of the patent application therefrom to provide the requisite antecedent basis for the claims.  In order to correct any errors and/or provide missing or supplemental information, the initial draft application must be reviewed by the inventors. While rare at this stage, R&D may be asked to perform additional experiments, but only if absolutely necessary prior to filing.  At the end of the review/revision process, a final draft of the patent application must be approved by the inventor(s) prior to filing. Since the draft patent application needs to be approved by the inventor(s), another important piece of information that should accompany the invention disclosure is a listing of persons who materially contributed to the creation of the invention.  From the listing of contributors, MANE patent counsel will conduct an inquiry into the nature of each contributor\\'s involvement and make a legal determination as to whose contribution rises to the level of \"inventorship.\"It is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features (i.e., novel and/or non-obvious) of the invention.  Conception, which is the key to inventorship, may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice.  And because inventions are defined by the claims, an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that (s)he conceived.  Additionally, those claim element(s) must be one of the inventive elements. To be co-inventors, the contributions of each person need not be equal or the same.  All that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application.  Please note that being present during a meeting, providing research support, setting up experiments at the instruction of another, or sensory/analytical testing, does not by itself indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention.\\n\\nWhat parts make up a patent application?\\nSince a patent application serves to provide a written description describing and enabling others to practice and use the invention, the inventors must provide patent counsel with\\nsufficient details to create the application.  The detailed invention disclosure provided to patent counsel will be used to create the basic parts (sections) of a patent application,\\nwhich include Title, Abstract, Background, Summary of the Invention, Brief Description of the Drawings (if applicable), Detailed Description of the Invention, and the Claims.\\n\\nWhere is the initial patent application filed?\\nThe initial filing (or so-called \"priority filing\") is typically performed where the invention is made.\\n\\nWhat happens after a patent application is filed?\\nThe filing of a patent application is not the end of the process, but really the beginning of a formal examination process.  Moreover, it is necessary to make decisions regarding the\\nfiling of one or more foreign patent applications. Under the Paris Convention (an international treaty created in 1883 requiring member countries to adopt certain minimum protections for industrial property), the priority filing permits the applicant to file one or more corresponding patent application in additional countries, within 12 months from the priority filing date.  Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which is another international treaty concluded in 1970, a single filing of a PCT application may be made with a Receiving Office (RO) in one language.  A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a patent, since there is no such thing as an \"international patent.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '629859ce258250ae89a2400878a2732d', 'range': (6389, 6513)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ff9b1693de0fb5221c1a3a46d405e980'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a patent, since there is no such thing as an \"international patent.\"Instead, a PCT application serves to establish a filing date in all contracting states, and must be followed up one or more national or regional phase applications to proceed towards grant of one or more patents. The PCT procedure essentially leads to a standard national or regional patent application, which may be granted or rejected according to applicable law, in each jurisdiction in which a patent is desired.  If a PCT application is desired, then it must be filed within 12 months from the priority filing date, i.e., the same deadline under the Paris Convention. However, the deadline for filing National Phase applications from the PCT application varies from member states, but is generally 30 months from the priority filing date.  So, in essence, the PCT serves as a mechanism to delay the decision for filing patent applications from 12 months to about 30 months, but only in the 153 member countries. In each jurisdiction, the claims of the patent application are evaluated for clarity, novelty, and inventiveness. After 18 months from the earliest priority date, the application publishes and thus the invention is available to the public.\\n\\nWhat to expect during examination of a patent application?\\nThe examination of a patent application begins with an examiner reviewing the clarity, novelty, and inventiveness of the claims vis-à-vis the prior art.  The examiner then issues an office action, which in most cases includes a rejection/objection of one or more of the pending claims.  An applicant is given a limited period of time (e.g., 3-4 months) to respond to the office action, which may include arguments, claim amendments, and/or evidence supporting the patentability of the pending claims. Depending on the nature of the rejection/objection, the inventor(s) may be consulted for technical input to assist patent counsel with developing claim amendments/rebuttal arguments to overcome the examiner\\'s rejection(s)/objection(s). Ideally, the inventor(s) should also be aware of what embodiments are being utilized in MANE\\'s commercial product/process.  Thus, this collaboration between patent counsel and the inventor(s) should provide MANE the best opportunity to obtain commercially-relevant granted patents.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'ff9b1693de0fb5221c1a3a46d405e980', 'range': (0, 124)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '629859ce258250ae89a2400878a2732d'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"What is a patent?\\nA patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. A few exemplary inventions include 1) a new process for making seamless capsules, 2) a new fragrance molecule, or 3) a new composition that blocks bitterness taste of high intensity sweeteners. Patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner’s consent. Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop patent infringement. Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party.\\n\\nWhat is patentable?\\nAn invention must, in general, fulfill the following conditions to be protected by a patent. 1. Industrially applicable (useful): It must be of practical use. 2. New: It must show an element of “novelty”, meaning some new characteristic that is not part of the body of existing knowledge in its particular technical field. That body of existing knowledge is called “prior art”. 3. Inventive (not obvious):  It must show an “inventive step” that is not obvious or routine by a person with average knowledge of the technical field. The subject matter of the invention must also be accepted as “patentable” under the patent laws of a given county. In many countries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods or methods of medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) are not generally patentable. For example abstract ideas (Einstein's equation E=mc2), laws of nature (gravity), or natural occurring phenomena (a chemical found in nature) are not patentable, but specific applications of these things could be patentable.\\n\\nHow long does a patent last?\\nPatent rights may last for up to 20 years, IF renewal or maintenance fees are paid in a timely manner.\\n\\nWhich countries are covered by a patent?\\nPatents are granted by national patent offices or by regional offices that carry out examination work for a group of countries – for example, the European Patent Office (EPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). Under such regional systems, an applicant requests protection for an invention in one or more countries, and each country decides\\nwhether to offer patent protection within its borders. The WIPO-administered Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides for the filing of a single international patent application that has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries. However, in order to obtain a patent in a PCT member nation, a patent application must be filed and prosecuted in the PCT member nation.\\n\\nWhat is patent infringement?\\nPatent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license. The definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction, but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention. In many countries, a use is required to be commercial (or to have a commercial purpose) to constitute patent infringement. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. In other words, the terms of the claims inform the public of what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder. Patents are territorial, and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force.\\n\\nWhat do I do if I think I have an invention?\\nDo not disclose your invention to anyone outside of the company, and contact Mane's Legal and IP Department.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': []}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '11cd2c9a6c71b21baa348cec257d3e33'}>,\n",

But because they concern persons, they must retain control over them.\\n\\nA natural person can be identified:\\n• directly (e.g. surname and first name);\\n• indirectly (e.g. by a telephone number or license plate, an identifier such as the social security number, a postal or e-mail address, but also the voice or image).\\n\\nThe identification of a natural person can be carried out:\\n• from a single information (e.g. name);\\n• from the cross-matching of a set of data (e.g. a woman living at such address, born on this day and member of such association).\\n\\nHowever, company contact details (e.g. company \"Company A\" with its postal address, switchboard telephone number and a generic contact email \"company1@email.com\") are not personal data.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': []}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '67e43f1f3871ad2ee580e57b876f6bc1'}>,\n",

It can be a database or an Excel table, but also a video surveillance installation, a credit card payment or biometric recognition system, a smartphone application, etc. New processing methods appear regularly and evolve according to technological innovations.\\n\\nComputerized or not: a processing of personal data can be computerized or not. For example, a paper document might be organized according to a filing plan or candidate application forms classified in alphabetical or chronological order are also a processing of personal data.\\n\\nThe controller is the legal person (company, public authority, etc.) or natural person who determines the purposes and means of a processing, defines the purpose and the method of carrying it out.

The preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of the page, nor cover any information already entered on the page. Transparent tape or other adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface.\\n\\nHow to put successive insert into the notebook ?\\nFor two successive inserts, the second must be affixed below the other (or on two successive pages) and not side by side. Each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both the writer and the witness (each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between the insert and the support page). Other than the aforementioned dates and signatures, no other handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted.\\n\\nWould it be possible to add information to the laboratory notebook or to make an amendment?\\nIf the need for a later entry or amendment arises, it is advisable to use unmarked section of the page immediately below, and particularly point out the passage(s) concerned. Where no such unmarked section is available, one should make the entry/amendment on a subsequent page, and record the subsequent page number on the instant page. An arrow, asterisk, etc. can be used to precisely identify the section being amended or corrected.\\n\\nWhat is the procedure to annotate an information on a insert?\\nIf there is a need to annotate information on an insert (e.g., for reasons of clarity), the \"original\" preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied; the corresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the notebook page.\\n\\nIs it necessary to integrate every piece of data into the laboratory notebook?\\nIt is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook. For example, if the data set is too large, the writer can also create alternative archives for the data (e.g., an electronic database of HPLC chromatographs), and simply reference the corresponding file number.\\n\\nCan a photograph or a digitized reproduction be used into the laboratory notebook?\\nRather than the original of an experimental material, a photograph or a digitized reproduction may be used, such as in the case of a thin-layer chromatography plate, a gel, a membrane, an autoradiography, or a thermosensitive ticket.\\n\\nWhat other informations can be inserted into a laboratory notebook ?\\nHere’s an example of other informations that can be inserted : Computer-generated data, Datasheet templates, E-mails, Notes of discussions and conversations, Photographs, Printed graphs, Product labels, Related papers and readings\\n\\nCan large items be kept in a separate folder?\\nIf too large to fit, items may be kept in a separate folder Always record date and other identifying information.\\n\\nCan I leave blank spaces between two information entries ?\\nSignificant blank spaces between two information entries (for example, successions of blank lines, page breaks, pages left blank) or to the right of an insert, must be crossed out by means of a \"Z\", so that no information may be subsequently added. The removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited, as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook.\\n\\nHow handwritten entries should be made?\\nSignificant blank spaces between two information entries (for example, successions of blank lines, page breaks, pages left blank) or to the right of an insert, must be crossed out by means of a \"Z\", so that no information may be subsequently added. The removal of any laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited, as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the entire notebook.\\n\\nIs there a recommendation regarding the use of ink ?\\nBlack or dark blue inks are recommended. The use of erasable ink, pencil, or \"white correction fluid\" is not allowed. The texts and entries must be legible (any erasure must be referred to and dated, both by the editor and the witness)\\n\\nIs the use of specific colors to code informations allowed ?\\nAny coding of information using specific colors should be avoided. If the use of colors cannot be avoided, the selection of colors and/or textures must be made with careful consideration of a possible need for subsequent reproduction using a standard photocopier in black and white.\\n\\nAre all tests, experiments or analysis have to be recorded inside the laboratory notebook ?\\nEach test, experiment, or analysis, whether positive or negative, must be recorded in the laboratory record.\\n\\nCan abbreviations be used inside the notebook?\\nAbbreviations may be used. However, abbreviations that are non-standard to persons having ordinary skill in the relevant field must be defined at their first appearance. Further, abbreviations, along with their definition, should also be recorded after the table of contents/index section at the front of the laboratory notebook.\\n\\nIf a protocol has already been described in a laboratory notebook, is it necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry?\\nIf a protocol has already been described, in the same or different laboratory notebook, it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry. Rather, it is sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity. All the modifications, changes or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described.\\n\\nIs it possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures?\\nYes, it is possible to possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording standard laboratory or testing procedures and then make an appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook.\\n\\nWhat are the duties of the author of the laboratory notebook ?\\nHere’s a list of the main duties of the author : Each page must be dated.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'SUPPLY TERMS & CONDITIONS PLAYBOOK\\n\\nThese “Supply T&Cs Playbook” guidelines are intended to cover the review of contracts proposed by counterparties (more and more in the form of general specifications or quality agreements, etc…), and the review of amendments to Mane’s supply agreement proposals that are made by counterparties.\\n\\nOur very first concern is liability: a provision to limit it is compulsory in any document under which Mane commits to sells products.\\n\\nOther key concerns are IPR, applicable law, exclusivity, warranty.\\n\\nLIABILITY: THE MANDATORY PROVISION\\n\\nLiability cap.  We must always have a cap of some kind, related to the turnover for Mane.  Try first to limit to the amount of the order, or 50% of the amount of the products invoiced in the year preceding the claim.  Then we can escalate to the amount of products invoiced in the preceding year.  If the customer continues to push, then we should continue to push back, arguing for the legitimacy of a cap.\\n\\nArguments for the cap:\\n\\nMane does not sign supply agreements without a limitation of liability.\\n\\nIt is standard in our industry – and other industries – for the component supplier to cap its liability.\\n\\nA cap establishes a proportion between the commercial relationship (i.e., revenues achieved) and the risk that Mane must accept.\\n\\nReflects risk sharing (rather than risk transfer), particularly as the customer inspected the products and accepted them for use.\\n\\nMane cannot take on the full liability for the customer’s products in the market. The customer has sole discretion over whether and how to process the products, and where and how to market and sell its products that incorporate Mane’s products.  The consumer market is not Mane’s business, and we don’t achieve the revenues that correspond to the products in the market which would provide a natural form of insurance for product failures.\\n\\nMane does not carry insurance coverage at a sufficient level to protect against liabilities that arise from our customers’ activities in the consumer marketplace.\\n\\nMane’s prices are structured to reflect the risk that Mane is able to take.  We would need to charge higher prices if we would be liable on our customers’ products in the consumer market.\\n\\nConsider that the liability cap bears no relationship to the insurance coverage that Mane carries.  Customers – and even members of the Mane Sales group – will sometimes take the position that the cap can be higher because of the level of Mane’s insurance, but this is not valid.\\n\\nExclusions from liability.  We should always exclude consequential damages as the very minimum, under any applicable law.  Under other laws than French laws, we must also exclude indirect, punitive, incidental, and special damages.  Punitive damages probably cannot be excluded by contract under certain US States applicable laws, but we usually state this anyway.\\n\\nIndemnity.  We try to avoid use of “hold harmless,” (parties generally do not intend for this to mean something in addition to “indemnify,” but Courts will interpret in some meaning to “hold harmless” that is separate from “indemnify”).  Indemnity is granted only as to direct damages.  We also strive to avoid any commitment to “defend,” or to be responsible for costs or attorneys’ fees.\\n\\nIPR & EXCLUSIVITY\\n\\nIntellectual property.\\nUnder no circumstances will Mane assign or transfer IPR.  Some parties (including Mane contract managers) confuse this with exclusivity.  Further, it should be expressly stated that the IPR in and relating to the products, their manufacture, development or creation (including any improvements, specifications, formulation and documentation) belong to Mane.  A customer may argue for “joint development” terms, so that it can share in the IPR, but this is almost never truly the case, as Mane is the party actually developing the IPR.\\n\\nExclusivity.\\nGenerally, we avoid exclusivity conditions in supply contracts, and would only agree upon specified commercial conditions in a separate agreement.  If exclusivity has to be granted (to be validate by business management) several conditions must circumscribe it: restricted geographic scope, limited duration, limited to a specified product/reference (as identified by product code), limited to particular application, and either a minimum annual purchase requirement or a reciprocal commitment by the customer to purchase its needs for this flavor / fragrance in this application exclusively from Mane.\\n\\nAPPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION/ ARBITRATION\\n\\nSpecify governing law and exclusive jurisdiction for resolution of disputes\\n\\nU.S.:  (1) Ohio (Hamilton County); (2) New York (Southern District of New York); (3) Delaware.

We generally try to avoid mandatory arbitration.\\n\\nMain advantage = confidentiality\\nMain disadvantage = expensive especially when we contract with much bigger companies.\\n\\nIn the U.S. more particularly:\\nMore expensive.\\nMay be faster than litigation (although it probably just depends), but it may be better for Mane (especially if it is a claim against Mane, and/or is particularly complex) to not rush to a decision.\\nArbitrator is motivated to extend controversy, because payment is higher, whereas courts are motivated to move claims off docket.\\nRiskier, because it highly depends on quality and experience of the arbitrator.\\nArbitrators are known to “split the baby,” meaning that notwithstanding how speculative a claim might be, they will say “you each have your points,” and divide the claim.  Counterparties know this and use mandatory arbitration as a way of enhancing the likelihood of achieving at least some kind of award.\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'ddbf927b68c399603d0287178c776f1e', 'range': (6178, 6311)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '19373a51e5c5da8b1c1769e97c08da12'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Counterparties know this and use mandatory arbitration as a way of enhancing the likelihood of achieving at least some kind of award.\\nRules – especially in terms of discovery and admission of evidence – are more permissive than in standard litigation (needs to be organized in the arbitration clause).\\nNo appeals possible.\\nThere seems to be greater right for the arbitrator to make a subjective determination, rather than being bound by precedent in quite the same way that a court would be.\\n\\nPRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS, INSPECTION & WARRANTY\\n\\nProduct specifications: necessary definition and inspection\\n\\nSpecifications.  Mane’s specifications (technical data sheets) govern.  If the customer argues, we can accept “mutually agreed-upon” specifications. In any case customer’s specifications must be validated and agreed in writing by Mane to be applicable.\\n\\nTime limit for inspection.  We must always state a time limit for the customer’s inspection of the products for obvious / patent defects.  We start at 5 days.  Next is 10 days.  Then we might go to 10 working days, or 14 days.  Anything longer is too much to accept.\\n\\nRemedies and warranties for non-conformity\\n\\nClaims for defects.\\nDefects noticeable upon unloading: shortages, excess or apparently damaged products must be notified to the carrier and Mane within 3 days maximum.\\nOther defects: specify a time limit to notify of a claim for defect (whether patent or latent) after discovery, and generally should insist on a maximum of 5 days after discovery.  There shouldn’t be argument on why the customer would require a much longer period to notify Mane of a discovered defect.\\n\\nMane’s acknowledgment of non-conformity.  We cannot accept that the customer unilaterally decides that the products are defective – it must be proven defective. Our preferred approach: (1) customer files its claim with Mane; (2) Mane inspects on-site or receives a sample to inspect; (3) if Mane confirms the claim, a remedy is followed, but if Mane disputes the claim, an independent lab (agreed upon by the parties) makes the determination.\\n\\nConsequences of non-conformity.  The customer may not send the products back to Mane without Mane’s consent.  The customer cannot be entitled to cancel the order or charge a fee.\\n\\nRemedies for non-conformity.  If Mane acknowledges the claim, Mane will either replace the product or reimburse the amounts paid in respect of the defective / non-conforming product.  This is offered as the “sole compensation” or “sole remedy.”  If the customer insists and strongly objects to this as the “sole remedy,” we can withdraw.  But we will not accept that the customer expressly reserves the right to invoke rights in addition to one of these remedies.\\n\\nWarranties.\\nMane should only warrant that the products will comply with the specifications.\\nThe warranty is linked to the time limit for claims but could be made for the shelf life stated by Mane (if unlimited duration is required, this is the maximum that we can accept).\\nWe will also warrant to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, although we should probably avoid further warranting to industry standards.  These are the sole warranties.\\n\\nThe warranties do not extend to defects that result from the customer’s improper storage, handling or use, including such that does not conform to the specifications and/or Mane’s instructions.\\nWe do not warrant free from defects (“defects” is ambiguous and subjective term).\\nWe expressly exclude the warranties of merchantability and fitness for the particular purpose.  If the customer insists on fitness for the purpose, we can accept, provided it is stated that such specific purpose must have been delivered in writing by the customer.\\nWe resist as much as we can to warranty against infringement. If it becomes a dealbreaker not to warrant that the products do not infringe upon third party IPR, then we strive for (i) “to the best of Mane’s knowledge” and (ii) that “the warranty applies only to Mane’s products “as such” or “in themselves,” and ensure we are excluding the possibility of a warranty as to Mane’s product in application (i.e., Mane’s product after customer’s processing or combination with something else).\\n\\nORDERING & DELIVERY PROCESS\\n\\nOrder.\\nMane must confirm an order (we usually offer three working days, better five for Europe) for it to be binding.  Upon such acceptance, the order is a contract binding upon both parties, and may not be cancelled.\\nMane should implicitly reserve the right to reject orders, but if the customer resists the possibility of Mane having the right to turn down orders, then we can accept to state that Mane may not reject orders except if the order states a quantity that is so substantially large that we cannot produce to that level (or upon the lead-time asserted), or if the order includes non-agreed terms.\\nIf the customer strongly insists upon the right to cancel open orders, we can sometimes accept, but strictly upon the condition that Mane has not begun production of the goods under the order.\\n\\nForecasts.\\nEither binding on both, or binding on neither. Mane cannot accept to be contractually bound to produce to forecasts if the customer is not obliged to purchase accordingly.\\nBetter not to mention in the contract any forecast from the customer if the customer has no intention to be bound by it.\\nIf the parties will have a mutually binding forecast, Mane’s supply agreement template provides guidelines on requirements (flexibility rules of rolling forecast).\\n\\nStock.\\nIf the customer requires Mane to hold stock, it should be set up in a separate stock keeping agreement.  This independent contract will impose obligations on the customer to ensure the stock is purchased.\\n\\nDelivery.\\nMane specifies the delivery lead-time on an EXW basis (meaning lead-time until we place the products at the disposal of the customer at Mane’s premises, not cleared for export and not loaded).\\nWe prefer selling our products on an FCA Mane production facility basis, as per ICC 2010 incoterms (meaning “delivery” occurs when we load the goods on the means of transport provided by the carrier at Mane’s premises).\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '19373a51e5c5da8b1c1769e97c08da12', 'range': (0, 133)}, {'doc_id': '9c499df70be0f8c7b22161ff693f9c59', 'range': (5932, 6152)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ddbf927b68c399603d0287178c776f1e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'We prefer selling our products on an FCA Mane production facility basis, as per ICC 2010 incoterms (meaning “delivery” occurs when we load the goods on the means of transport provided by the carrier at Mane’s premises).\\n\\nWe strive to avoid penalties for delays or quantity defects. If from the business perspective we cannot reject the principle of such penalties for delayed delivery or quantity defects, penalties must be negotiated as follows.  Penalty calculation must be clearly defined in the contract, and can only apply to product defects or delayed delivery.   Penalty requirement:\\n\\n-Penalties must only apply to late deliver or product defect.\\n-Never more than 10% the total associated sale value.\\n-No more than 2% per week delivery is delayed.\\n-Mane requires 30 day right to object.\\n-Penalty must be expressly stated as liquidated damage (and exclusive remedy).\\n-Strive to prevent customer right to cancel.\\n-Method of payment/deduction from future invoices must be spelled out.\\n\\nWe also strive to avoid “time is of the essence,” because then on-time delivery becomes a material condition, and since delays do occur, it can be a big risk area.\\nAny provisions on transport and delivery must align with the agreed-upon Incoterm.\\nAlso, risk of loss is determined by the applicable Incoterm.\\n\\nTransfer of title.\\nOur starting point is transfer at time of full payment for the goods.  But if the customer argues, we can generally accept title transfer upon delivery.\\n\\nFINANCIAL CONDITIONS\\n\\nPrices.\\nWe cannot accept to refer to the order to determine the prices.  The prices should either be in the supply agreement itself, or in a separate offer sent by Mane.\\nApplicable ICC 2010 incoterm to be specified, preferred: FCA Mane production facility.\\n\\nPrice changes.\\nPrices are only locked during a validity period stated by Mane, and after such time Mane can update the prices at its discretion.  During the price validity period, Mane should reserve the right to update prices in case of a substantial rise in the cost of the raw materials (hardship clause).\\n\\nIn respect of price changes during the validity period, we argue that such fluctuations in raw material prices are out of our control, and we must avoid being bound to continue to honor contracts at existing prices if becomes prohibitively expensive to sell the products.  Considering that our customers are other businesses, they should understand this fundamental economics precept, and acknowledge that they would likewise not want to be prevented from passing on additional costs they incur in their own sourcing.\\n\\nPayment.  Payment terms 30, 45 or 60 days from date of invoice.  Anything longer than 60 days is invalid in Europe.  In Asia, Mane might accept a period up to 90 days but should be confirmed first by local management.  Terms run strictly from date of invoice, not receipt of invoice or receipt of goods.  We state no discount is granted for early payment (unless management has expressly approved a discount).\\n\\nLate payments.  We try to state that Mane reserves the right to suspend further delivery of products until all overdue payments are collected.  We also sometimes state that overdue payments bear interest per applicable laws, although if applicable law like French law entitles Mane to charge interest, then it seems unnecessary to require the mention of this implicit right.\\n\\nSet off.  Some customers include a clause entitling it to set off amounts that it asserts Mane owes to it against payments due to Mane.  Generally we reject these clauses.  If the customer insists, then we state that Mane must first validate the amount that the customer claims that Mane owes to it.  It should not often be the case that Mane owes the customer money anyway.\\n\\nMANE CONTRACTING PARTY\\n\\nThe contracting party to a supply agreement among the Mane entities must be the invoicing Mane company.\\n\\nAll Mane companies are invoicing, except as follows:\\n\\nAsia : Mane Korea is not invoicing;\\nEMEA : only the following companies, on top of VMF, are invoicing, as follows:\\n\\n* Only the following products: ice cream flavors and mixes (former Gelcrem products)  and products manufactured in Rubi\\nAll other sales in EMEA are invoiced from VMF.\\n\\nMISCELLANEOUS\\n\\nLegal entity.  Confirm the entity is indeed an active registered entity in a certain jurisdiction.  It is generally best to state the company’s jurisdiction and principal physical address.\\n\\nRecitals.  If the contract contains a preamble, including “Whereas” clauses, it is advisable to avoid placing operative terms in this section, as this is generally regarded as the place to “set the table” for the contract, rather than begin establishing binding contractual conditions. Sometimes terms are defined in the preamble, which is usually okay, since their use occurs in the operative part of the contract.\\n\\nApplicable documents.  Check for all references to the applicability of an external document (e.g., supplier expectations, code of conduct, etc.).  All external documents must be submitted to the contract review procedure (including review by Legal), and in some cases (e.g., specifications) should be attached as exhibits to the contract.  General Terms & Conditions of both parties are excluded.\\n\\nPurpose.  It is prudent to state the purpose of the contract, which should be to establish the terms and conditions for Mane’s sale, and the customer’s purchase, of the goods identified to the contract. Further, we generally should state that the products are intended to be integrated into the customer’s own products, and may not be resold as is, provided to a Mane competitor, or repackaged for distribution to third parties. Make sure that agreement is a supply contract as some customers attempt to consider Mane as a toll manufacturer or service provider.\\n\\nConfidentiality.  It is generally advisable to state that the parties will keep technical and commercial information confidential.  For instance, the customer may learn things about Mane’s pricing, cost inputs (although this is not something the business should be disclosing), and administrative information.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'For instance, the customer may learn things about Mane’s pricing, cost inputs (although this is not something the business should be disclosing), and administrative information.  Be watchful if we have an existing CDA with the customer, however, as we may need to specifically state that the CDA applies (particularly so we don’t inadvertently supersede the CDA by including confidentiality obligations here).\\n\\nForce majeure.  Mane cannot have liability of any kind in case of true force majeure circumstances.  We can accept that the customer may terminate the agreement with immediate effect if the force majeure condition persists for more than 90 days.\\n\\nIt is advisable to state periods of time in either days or years, because a “month” can be more ambiguous.  Does it mean 30 days?  31 days?  28 days, because of four seven-day weeks?  It could also arguably be interpreted to mean full calendar months must elapse – e.g., if the contract is effective July 10th, and specifies some right accrues after 3 months, perhaps all of August, September and October (i.e., 3 months) must pass.  Probably what is meant is the right occurs on October 10th, but using “90 days” just avoids all that interpretation.\\n\\nTerm.  It is probably prudent to state a term (anywhere from 1 to 5 years, depending on the circumstances and management’s opinion).  We can structure to automatically renew, or renew only upon mutual agreement. In any case, the prices if mentioned in the agreement, must be valid for the price validity period only.\\n\\nTermination.  Termination of the supply agreement does not end the customer’s obligation to fulfill its purchase commitment under outstanding orders.  We generally seek a thirty day cure period for termination due to default.\\n\\nAssignment.  No assignment without consent.  Generally we want to have the ability to negotiate separately with a different party.\\n\\nAmendment.  State that amendment is possible only upon mutual written agreement.\\n\\nNo waiver.  State that failure to insist upon strict compliance does not constitute a waiver.\\n\\nSeverability.  State that if a provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions are not affected, and only the offending provision is excluded.\\n\\nSome counterparties instead state that the offending provision is to be construed to most closely approximate the parties’ intent while taking a legally valid form.  It is fine as an alternative.\\n\\nEntire agreement.  State that the contract constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes previous agreements.  Confirm that this is the case, and there aren’t active agreements that we want to keep but could be impacted by this contract.\\n\\nSignatures. MANE prefers “wet” signatures when feasible.  However, situations will arise where an electronic signature is required due to counterparty demands or practicalities of the situation.  In these situations, a variance from the wet signature requirement may be granted by the assigned Legal Counsel on a case-by-case basis, subject to the requirements of this section.\\nIn order for MANE to accept an electronic signature, the agreement must be governed by laws that allow for electronic signatures to be binding on the parties.  The signature itself must be validated to both European Union and local requirements.  This means that the signature must use two-factor authentication or a digital certificate meeting the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.\\nThe electronic signature services selected by many MANE counterparties do not comply with these requirements.  In order to facilitate the collection of compliant signatures, MANE has contracted with DocuSign to provide a platform for collecting and validating electronic signatures.\\nIf a contract is approved for electronic signature and the counterparty does not provide a compliant method of signing the contract, then the MANE contract manager shall request the regional DocuSign account holder to generate an electronic “envelope” containing the document.  The contract manager will supply the person generating the envelope with the name, title, and email address of the signer.  In order to meet EU electronic signature requirements, the signer will either have to supply their mobile phone number to the MANE contact to receive an SMS password, or obtain a digital certificate at their own expense.\\n\\nOriginals.  Require that the counterparty execute two originals (so that each party may receive its own original hard copy) if the signatures are not to be electronic.\\n\\nWe may accept to language that specifies a facsimile or electronic copy qualifies as an original, provided we make it clear to the counterparty that we nevertheless require to receive a hard copy original.\\n\\nIndividual signers.  The parties should have authorized representatives execute. Beware of “duly authorized” and make sure it is the case.\\n\\nTheoretically, counterparty might be able to avoid a contract if it can successfully claim that an unauthorized employee entered into a commitment.  Nevertheless, it is helpful to keep in mind that we should be looking for individuals with appropriate titles as the signatories.\\nWhen French laws are applicable, in case of doubt on the capacity of the signatory to sign the contract in the name and on behalf of the company, the following is to be sent in an e-mail to the counterparty (by Mane Contract Manager):\\nThank you for confirming that Mr./Mrs…………….. in his/her quality of ………….. is entitled to sign the contract for and on behalf of the company……………before the…….\\n\\nCountry\\nMane affiliate\\nSwitzerland\\nMANE SA\\nItalia\\nMANE ITALIA SRL\\nSpain\\nMANE IBERICA SA\\nPoland*\\nMANE POLSKA SP ZOO*\\nTurkey\\nMANE AROMA VE ESANS SANAYI VE TICARET (LIMITED SIRKETI)\\nRussia\\nMANE VOSTOK LLC\\nSouth Africa\\nMANE SOUTH AFRICA PROPRIETARY LIMITED\\nSouth Africa\\nMANE SAVOURY SOUTH AFRICA\\nUkraine\\nLIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY “MANE UKRAINE”\\nUkraine\\nUSALVIA LLC\\nKazahkstan\\nMANE (KAZAKHSTAN) LLP\\nMoldavia\\nMOLSALVIA S.R.L.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 3, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '9c499df70be0f8c7b22161ff693f9c59', 'range': (0, 178)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3f97b698a93fc6f672c29fc12401c44d'}>,\n",
