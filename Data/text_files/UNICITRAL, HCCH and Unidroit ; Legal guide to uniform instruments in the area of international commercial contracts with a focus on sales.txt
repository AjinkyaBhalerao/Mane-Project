Introduction
A.
Origin and purpose of the Guide
1.
For several decades, the Hague Conference on Private International Law
(HCCH), the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law  (UNCITRAL) 
and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit) have
been preparing uniform law texts that promote the progressive harmonization and
modernization of commercial contract law. Other international governmental and
non-governmental organizations have also made significant  contributions at the
global and regional levels.
2.
Over time, the HCCH, UNCITRAL and Unidroit have produced a series
of texts that are complementary: the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods (1980) (CISG);1 the Unidroit Principles of Inter-
national Commercial Contracts (UPICC);2 and the HCCH Principles on Choice
of Law in International Commercial Contracts (HCCH Principles).3 In addition,
 UNCITRAL has prepared treaties, such as the United Nations Convention on the
Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (2005) (Electronic
Communications Convention)4 and the Convention on the Limitation Period in
the International Sale of Goods (1974, amended in 1980) (Limitation Convention),5
that are closely related to the CISG and complement it with regard to specific
matters.6 Similarly, the HCCH has historically adopted a number of treaties that
deal with choice of law rules in international sales: the Convention on the Law
Applicable to International Sales of Goods (1955) (HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods
Convention);7 the Convention on the Law Applicable to Agency (1978) (HCCH
1978 Agency Convention);8 and the Convention on the Law Applicable to Con-
tracts for the International Sale of Goods (1986) (HCCH 1986 Sales Convention).9

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
In relation to sales, Unidroit adopted the Convention on Agency on the Inter-
national Sale of Goods (1983), regulating substantive aspects of agency.10 
3.
The drafting of the above-mentioned texts was often carried out in coordina-
tion with the other organizations. A good illustration of this is the legislative history
of the CISG, for the preparation of which UNCITRAL took advantage of earlier
uniform texts developed by Unidroit.11 In turn, the CISG influenced the
 development of later uniform texts such as the UPICC. Moreover, texts like the
HCCH Principles build upon – and help implement – the CISG and the UPICC.
4.
To achieve their intended purpose, uniform texts need to be accompanied by
adequate support for their implementation. The three organizations have developed
a range of tools to that end, such as the Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts (CLOUT)
information system,12 the UNILEX database, which contains a collection of, among
others, international case law on the UPICC,13 and the Model Clauses for the Use
of the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts.14
5.
Uniform international trade law is aimed at achieving a harmonized and global
set of rules which are international in their origin, formulation and framework of
application and interpretation; consequently, uniform law diminishes the legal
 obstacles to the flow of international trade, levels the playing field among buyers
and sellers, strengthens commercial relations among States and generates invest-
ment opportunities. In the light of the manifold advantages of uniform law in this
sector, the above-mentioned uniform texts were developed to introduce balanced
rules suitable for international transactions, and to assist parties in drafting their
contracts and adjudicators in resolving disputes. Each of the texts provides the
parties with some autonomy to decide, by agreement, the extent to which the text
will govern their transaction. However, information on how the texts relate to each
other is not always readily available. As a result, commercial parties, lawyers, judges,
arbitrators, academic researchers and legislators interested in adopting, applying or
interpreting that vast legislative corpus may face challenges in identifying the
 relevant texts and placing them in context.
10 The Convention did not enter into force and has now been superseded by the UPICC, which contain a 
detailed section on agency in chapter 2, “Formation and authority of agents” (see also para. 369 and chap. V, 
sect. C, below).
11 See the Convention Relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods (1964) (United Nations, 
Treaty Series, vol. 834, No. 11929); and the Convention Relating to a Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods (1964) (United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 834, No. 11930) (for more on 
these two conventions, see para. 286 below); see also the HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Convention.

Introduction
3
6.
The present Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International
Commercial Contracts, with a Focus on Sales (the Guide) is aimed at clarifying the
relationship among the texts with a view to promoting their adoption, use and
uniform interpretation and, ultimately, the establishment of a predictable and flex-
ible legal environment for cross-border commercial transactions based on the prin-
ciple of freedom of contract.
7.
Accordingly, the Guide provides orientation to the reader on a range of legal
issues relating to international commercial contract law, from choice of law to the
legislative, contractual and guidance texts that may assist in a commercial transaction.
The Guide is not intended to favour any particular interpretation, or to offer any
new interpretation of uniform texts.
8.
The Guide was prepared on the basis of a joint proposal,15 which had resulted
from a series of events organized by the UNCITRAL secretariat to celebrate the
thirty-fifth anniversary of the CISG.16 It was approved by the governing bodies of
the HCCH, UNCITRAL and Unidroit.17 It was compiled by the respective sec-
retariats with input from a group of five experts, representing different legal tradi-
tions and geographical backgrounds: Neil Cohen (United States of America);
Lauro da Gama e Souza Jr (Brazil); Pilar Perales Viscasillas (Spain); Hiroo Sono
(Japan); and Stefan Vogenauer (Germany). It is designed to be a living document
and will be kept under review by the three secretariats, with a view to its periodic
revision.
B.
Scope and approach
9.
The Guide deals with international commercial contracts, with a particular
focus on sales. Consumer contracts are not covered. The Guide also provides guid-
ance on the interaction between sales contracts and certain closely related transactions
such as barter, agency and distribution. It further provides guidance on cross-cutting
issues such as the use of electronic communications.
10.
The Guide deals specifically with the uniform texts prepared by the HCCH,
UNCITRAL and Unidroit. It refers to legislative texts such as treaties and model

contract law (with a focus on sales)” (A/CN.9/892).

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
laws, as well as principles and model clauses that are designed to be implemented 
by the parties in their contractual arrangements. 
11. 
The Guide is thus an effort to clarify the relationship among those uniform 
international legal texts and is a document prepared jointly by the three secretariats 
to promote uniformity, certainty and clarity in this area of the law. 
12. 
The Guide makes reference to uniform texts prepared by other international 
governmental and non-governmental organizations with a global or regional scope 
to the extent that those texts assist in clarifying the operation of HCCH, UNCITRAL 
and Unidroit texts. Reference is also made to guidance documents that may offer 
useful additional information to the reader. The Guide is not aimed at providing 
an exhaustive list of global and regional texts relevant to international commercial 
contracts. In particular, the Guide does not cover those international instruments 
which, although not primarily addressing international sales contracts, refer to the 
CISG and the UPICC as an expression of general principles and provisions suitable 
for modern contract laws.18
13. 
The Guide contains a discussion of private international law (PIL)19 issues, 
focusing on the HCCH Principles and their relation to the CISG and the UPICC, 
with a view to explaining the extent to which the contractual parties may choose 
the applicable law and the consequences of not making such a choice. The Guide 
also provides an overview of the content of the CISG and the Limitation Conven-
tion. The nature, use and content of the UPICC are covered, and similarities and 
differences between the CISG and other uniform texts with which the UPICC may 
interact are highlighted. Finally, the Guide contains references to a number of 
 recurrent legal issues related to sales contracts.
18 A recent example is the Legal Guide on Contract Farming by Unidroit, the Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion of the United Nations and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which is a guidance instru-
ment on agricultural production under contract adopted in 2015. It is available on the Unidroit website. 
19 It is generally understood that PIL consists of three elements: (a) jurisdiction; (b) applicable law; and (c) recogni-
tion and enforcement of foreign judgments. Administrative and judicial cooperation relating to these issues are 
also covered by PIL. In the Guide, the term PIL is used mainly with reference to applicable law and choice of 
law issues, in line with the use of that term in certain uniform instruments (e.g., CISG, art. 7, para. 2). The term 
“choice of law” is also used when it is necessary to reflect the terminology of the relevant instrument.

II.
Why read the Guide?
14.
The existence of different legal, political and economic systems around the
world leads to legal fragmentation that is an obstacle to the flow of trade. Uniform
law provides rules that are coherent and consistent on a global scale. In particular,
uniform law provides a uniform legal regime for international20 sale of goods con-
tracts. By doing so, it facilitates the development of international trade.
15.
Parties entering into international contracts, particularly those for the sale of
goods, are faced with a plethora of uniform law instruments. These instruments
are very useful both because they lead to uniformity in or harmonization of the
laws of different States and because they can simplify, clarify and modernize the
law for this important aspect of commerce.
16.
However, it is not always obvious how these uniform law instruments inter-
act with and complement each other. The purpose of the Guide is to provide an
intro duction to, and a brief summary of, several important legal instruments con-
cerning such contracts that have been prepared by the HCCH, UNCITRAL and
 Unidroit. Emphasis is placed on the complementary nature of these instruments
when more than one instrument applies to a transaction.
17.
The Guide can assist both parties and their lawyers, as well as mediators,
 arbitrators and judges, in navigating the uniform instruments that may be applicable.
The intended result is to enable parties to efficiently and effectively structure their
commercial transactions in the light of the benefits presented by the instruments.
18.
In view of its purpose and nature, the Guide does not purport to offer an
exhaustive treatment of the content of each instrument and of the interpretation
thereof by judges, arbitrators and scholars. Rather, it provides introductory guidance
to navigating them so as to assist in understanding their scope, basic provisions and
interaction. There are several useful sources, some available online at no cost, con-
taining case law, bibliographies and other information relating to these instruments.
A list of available sources of further information is provided in the annex.
20 The concept of “internationality”, which is more specific or broader depending on the instrument, will be 
explained in the relevant section for each individual instrument below.

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
19.
The instruments that are the primary focus of the Guide are:
(a)
CISG. As its name suggests, the CISG provides rules for the formation of
contracts and the rights and obligations of the parties for the international sale of 
goods. When it is applicable, it provides neutral legal rules governing such contracts 
and largely avoids the necessity of determining which State’s law governs key issues. 
Thus, the CISG may contribute significantly to introducing certainty in commercial 
exchanges and decreasing transaction costs; 
(b)
UPICC. The UPICC are a non-binding codification of contract law rules
and principles designed to be applied to commercial contracts on a global scale. Their 
objective is to provide parties, as well as adjudicators and other users, with a set of 
balanced rules that are particularly well suited to cross-border transactions. Being a 
“soft-law” instrument, they offer parties and adjudicators a range of different options 
as to their use, and an ample degree of flexibility;
(c)
HCCH Principles. The HCCH Principles are also a non-binding set of
principles, providing guidance for the development and refinement of legal rules 
governing the extent, and application, of the principle that parties to a commercial 
contract have the autonomy to select, by agreement, the law governing their contract. 
The HCCH Principles acknowledge and promote the principle of party autonomy 
(parties to a contract may be best positioned to determine which set of legal norms 
is best suited to their transaction) and, at the same time, set balanced boundaries for 
the principle. Thus, they are aimed at providing a refinement of the concept of party 
autonomy where it is already accepted. 
20.
Two instruments emanating from UNCITRAL are also addressed:
(a)
Limitation Convention. The Limitation Convention establishes uniform
rules governing the period of time within which a party to a contract for the inter-
national sale of goods must commence legal proceedings to assert a claim arising 
from the contract. By doing so, it brings clarity and predictability to an aspect of 
great importance for the adjudication of the claim; 
(b)
Electronic Communications Convention. The Electronic Communica-
tions Convention is aimed at legally enabling the use of electronic communications 
in international trade by assuring that communications exchanged electronically, 
 including contracts, are as valid and enforceable as their paper-based equivalents. 
21.
In addition, reference is made to other instruments emanating from inter-
national, supranational or regional bodies:
(a)
HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Convention. The HCCH 1955 Sales of
Goods Convention regulates the choice of law issues for the international sale of 
tangible goods; 
II.

(b)
HCCH 1978 Agency Convention. The HCCH 1978 Agency Convention
provides choice of law rules for agency relationships;
(c)
HCCH 1986 Sales Convention. The HCCH 1986 Sales Convention sets
out choice of law rules relating to contracts for the international sale of goods. It is

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
23.
The Guide contains an explanation of the difference between the circum-
stances in which the conventions and regulations, as “hard-law” instruments, are
applicable and have the force of law and the circumstances where “soft-law” instru-
ments, such as the UPICC and the HCCH Principles, may be applied. Moreover,
inasmuch as the applicability of hard-law instruments such as the CISG may
 depend on the determination of which State’s law is applicable, the Guide provides
information about the nature and sources of rules that govern the determination
of the applicable law.
24.
Because of the critical role played by the determination of applicable law, the
Guide contains an examination not only of the choice of law rules under the
HCCH Principles but also of the other PIL rules that may be applicable in a forum.
Hence, an analysis is presented in the Guide of choice of law rules under the
Rome  I Regulation, the Mexico Convention and the HCCH instruments men-
tioned in paragraph 21 (a)–(c) above. A brief survey of PIL rules used in various
States is also presented in the Guide. A key portion of the analysis relates to “party
autonomy” – the ability of the parties, under most choice of law regimes, to select
the law that governs their contract – and its limits.
25.
Another aspect of what is usually referred to as party autonomy is considered
as well: the parties’ “freedom of contract” to choose the rights and responsibilities
with respect to each other, subject to the limits put in place by the applicable law.
Reference is also made to terms that parties may incorporate in their sales contracts
by way of a shorthand clause, the content and interpretation of which are provided
by an international body. An example is the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC) Incoterms, which are shorthand clauses collected and developed by the ICC
and which reflect international practice. In addition, the role played by commercial
practices established between the parties and usages when the sales contract is
regulated by an international instrument is highlighted in the Guide.

III. Determination of the law 
applicable  to  international 
commercial  contracts 
A. Direct application of a uniform law treaty 
How do uniform law treaties apply to an 
international contract?
26. 
Modern uniform law treaties apply to international contracts when the 
require ments for their territorial and substantive application are met. The CISG, 
the Limitation Convention and the Electronic Communications Convention each 
define their scope of application, namely, the cross-border contracts and commu-
nications to which their provisions apply, by stating the requirements that must be 
satisfied. If those requirements are satisfied, the conventions apply without the 
need for recourse to PIL rules. 
CISG
27. 
In relation to its territorial scope of application, article 1, paragraph 1, of the 
CISG provides for two ways in which the CISG applies directly to international 
sales contracts: (a) when the parties’ respective places of business,22 as determined 
under the CISG, are in different contracting States (see paras.  106–109 below); 
and (b) when PIL rules lead to the application of the law of a contracting State. 
The latter case includes situations in which the law of a contracting State applies 
because the parties have selected it in the contract. 
28. 
International sales contracts may fall outside the scope of the CISG when 
the type of sales contract is not covered under the Convention (art. 2) or in the 
case of “mixed contracts”, in which the provision of labour or services is predomi-
nant (art. 3). The precise nature of these and other limits to the applicability of 
22 For the determination of the relevant “place of business” under the CISG, see paras.148-150 below.
10 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
the CISG has been explored by a number of court decisions, arbitral awards and 
doctrinal authorities.23 The law applicable to sales contracts outside the scope of 
the CISG is determined by the application of PIL rules.24
29. 
Article  6 of the CISG allows the parties to opt out of the Convention or 
derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions (with the exception of 
article 12), thus embodying the autonomy principles referred to in paragraphs 24 
and 25 above. According to almost unanimous case law and scholarly opinion, a 
contractual provision indicating which State law governs a contract does not con-
stitute such an opt-out. Rather, if the choice is of a contracting State and it is given 
effect by PIL rules, the result is that the CISG applies.
30. 
The applicability of the CISG to a contract may also be affected by the 
 declarations lodged by States (see paras. 106–110 and 283–286 below).25 
Limitation Convention 
31. With regard to the territorial scope of application of the Limitation Convention, 
article 3 of that Convention provides that the treaty applies directly to international 
sales contracts when the parties’ respective places of business are in different 
 contracting States or when the PIL rules lead to the application of the law of a 
contracting State. Moreover, parties may contractually agree on the application of 
the Limitation Convention, including by choosing the law of a contracting State, 
when allowed under PIL rules (see chap. III, sect. B, below). Article 3, paragraph 2, 
of the Convention allows the parties to agree on the exclusion of the application 
of the Convention (“opting out”).26
32. 
The applicability of the Limitation Convention to a contract may also be 
affected by the declarations lodged by States.27
23 For example, for the treatment of distribution contracts, see chapter V, section B, below, and for the treat-
ment of barter, see chapter V, section E, below.
24 For the choice of law rules, including the choice of the UPICC as non-State law, see chapter III, section B, below. 
25 For the status and text of the declarations made by the contracting States to the CISG, see the United  Nations 
Treaty Collection website.
26 The present paragraph explains the scope of application of the Limitation Convention as amended by the 
1980 Protocol amending the Limitation Convention. For more details, including information on the scope of 
application of the original 1974 Convention, see chapter IV, section B, below. 
27 For the status and text of the declarations made by the contracting States to the Limitation Convention, see 
the United Nations Treaty Collection website.
III. Determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts  
11
Electronic Communications Convention
33. 
The territorial and substantive scope of the Electronic Communications Con-
vention is defined in articles 1 and 2 of the Convention. The Convention applies 
to a broader variety of international commercial contracts than the CISG. Article 1, 
paragraph 1, of the Convention provides for its direct application when a PIL rule 
leads to the application of the law of a contracting State. According to article 19, 
a contracting State may lodge a declaration that it will apply the Convention when 
the parties’ respective places of business are in different contracting States. The 
Electronic Communications Convention is also applicable if the parties to the con-
tract have chosen its provisions as the law applicable to the contract. However, 
article 3 allows the parties to opt out of the application of the Convention or dero-
gate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions.
B. Application of PIL rules 
34. 
As seen above, international transactions can be governed by uniform law 
instruments that apply directly to the contract or by virtue of PIL rules.
35. 
Most jurisdictions, if not all, have PIL rules to which a court can refer in 
order to identify the law applicable to a particular legal relationship. In the context 
of  cross-border sales or transactions, there are two main ways of identifying the 
applicable law: (a) when the parties have chosen the law governing their contract, 
PIL rules will determine whether the parties’ choice is valid and effective; and 
(b)  when the parties have not chosen the law governing their contract or their 
choice is invalid or ineffective, PIL rules will determine which law applies to the 
transaction.
36. 
In this context, a uniform law instrument may become applicable to an inter-
national transaction, including sales contracts, other than by direct application, by 
virtue of PIL rules. 
37. 
There are three PIL routes by way of which a uniform law instrument may 
apply to an international transaction: (a) when the parties have chosen as the law 
governing their transaction the law of a State that has adopted a uniform law treaty 
which applies to the transaction; (b) when the parties have chosen a uniform law 
instrument as the “rules of law” to govern their transaction; and (c) when, in the 
absence of a choice of law by the parties, the relevant PIL rules lead to the applica-
tion of a uniform law treaty. 
12 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
38. 
Each of these routes is dependent on applicable PIL rules. Sometimes, the 
rules are the domestic PIL rules of a forum State while, other times, the PIL rules 
are those contained in a treaty to which the forum State is a contracting State. 
Domestic PIL rules may be influenced by soft-law principles such as the HCCH 
Principles.
39. 
The subsections below contain an examination of PIL rules found in treaties, 
which will be helpful in determining which law(s) are applicable to an international 
transaction. When examining these rules, two scenarios will be considered: (a) when 
the parties have made a choice of law; and (b) when the parties have not made 
such a choice. A brief summary of non-treaty PIL rules (soft law), in particular the 
HCCH Principles, is also provided. 
1. 
Application of PIL rules when parties make a choice of law
40. 
Party autonomy as to the choice of the law applicable to international con-
tracts is generally accepted in most jurisdictions across the world. It refers to the 
freedom of parties to select, through an agreement, the law(s) or legal system(s) 
to govern their contractual dealings. It is, however, important to note that that 
autonomy is not without limitations, and the extent of such autonomy differs from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
41. 
Such differences concern various aspects of parties’ choices, such as the 
 aspects of the contract that can be governed by the chosen law, formality require-
ments for making such choices and limitations imposed by public policy. Whether 
and to what extent parties can choose the law of a State or a non-State law to 
govern their contracts will be addressed in the following subsections.
42. 
There are several international instruments, some of which are used more 
often than others, that cover the issue of the law applicable to international con-
tracts and its application by State courts: the HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Conven-
tion, the HCCH 1978 Agency Convention, the Rome I Regulation and the HCCH 
Principles. The two HCCH conventions and the Rome I Regulation, which is a 
supranational instrument of mandatory application in the European Union mem-
ber States (except Denmark), are hard-law instruments. In contrast, the HCCH 
Principles are a soft-law and non-binding instrument of universal scope. 
43. 
The potential application of the Mexico Convention should also be noted.

American States in 2019, provides, inter alia, guidance on both the Mexico Con-
vention and the HCCH Principles.
Choice of State law or transnational (non-State) law
Arbitral setting
44. 
In arbitration, parties enjoy substantial freedom to choose non-State “rules 
of law” applicable to the merits of their dispute. Such freedom was recognized as 
early as 1985, in article 28, paragraph 1, of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Inter-
national Commercial Arbitration;29 this Model Law, as well as the UNCITRAL 
Arbitration Rules,30 have served as a model for many jurisdictions. Today, in 
accord ance with most arbitration laws and rules, arbitrators must uphold the 
 parties’ choice concerning the “rules of law” governing their dispute.
“Rules of law” and non-State law
45. 
The notion of rules of law is specified in the HCCH Principles as including 
rules that do not emanate from State sources but that are “generally accepted on 
an international, supranational or regional level as a neutral and balanced set of 
rules” (HCCH Principles, art. 3). Thus, “rules of law” may refer to legal rules, such 
as the UPICC, created by non-legislative bodies. The requirement that the rules 
be generally accepted as a neutral and balanced set of rules leads to the conclusion 
that those trade codes and similar instruments that have not achieved this degree 
of credibility as neutral and balanced would not qualify as “rules of law” for the 
purposes of the HCCH Principles. As discussed in paragraph 71 below, the HCCH 
Principles give effect to the choice of “rules of law” not only in an arbitral setting 
but also in a judicial setting, provided that such choice is allowed under the 
 otherwise applicable law.
46. 
In an arbitral setting, the CISG may be chosen as the law applicable even 
when the parties do not have their places of business in contracting States or the 
PIL rules do not lead to the application of the CISG. In this context, the CISG 
may apply as transnational (non-State) law. 
Judicial setting
47. 
In a judicial setting, parties are generally free to choose the State law appli-
cable to their contracts. Most national laws do not allow parties to choose non-State

(United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.V.4). For the status of enactments and additional information on the

rules of law to govern the contract, although in many cases this is the result of 
interpretation as the law is silent on this point.31 Nevertheless, even in States that 
do not give effect to the choice of non-State law by the parties, non-State law may 
still be applied indirectly by way of incorporation by reference, namely, as actual 
terms of the contract.32 
HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Convention
48. 
The HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Convention was one of the first steps 
 towards unification of international sales law. It regulates choice of law issues for 
the international sale of tangible goods. The Convention allows the parties to freely 
choose the applicable law (art. 2). In general, only one law can be identified as the 
applicable law (with the exception of article 4). The choice of law can either be 
made expressly or “unambiguously result from the provisions of the contract” 
(art. 2). The Convention identifies only the law of a State as the applicable law, 
but not non-State law. 
49. 
The Convention is currently in force in five European Union member States 
(Denmark, Finland, France, Italy and Sweden) and in the Niger, Norway and 
 Switzerland.33 Thus, for contracts that fall within its scope, the Convention takes 
precedence over the Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obliga-
tions34 and the Rome I Regulation (see articles 21 and 25, paragraph 1, of those 
instruments, respectively).
HCCH 1986 Sales Convention
50. 
The HCCH 1986 Sales Convention is aimed at unifying choice of law rules 
relating to contracts for the international sale of goods. It determines the law 
 applicable to contracts for the sale of goods between parties having their places of 
business in different States and in all other cases involving a choice between the 
laws of different States. It is a basic principle of the Convention that international 
sales are regulated by the law chosen by the parties to the contract (art. 7, para. 1). 
Such choice must be made expressly or clearly demonstrated by the terms of the 
contract and the conduct of the parties, viewed in their entirety, regarding either 
31 Inspired by the HCCH Principles, in Paraguay and Uruguay, national law expressly allows parties to choose 
non-State law to govern their contracts (Paraguay, Law No. 5393 on the Law Applicable to International Con-
tracts of 15 January 2015; and Uruguay, Law No. 19.920 on the General Law of Private International Law of 
27  November 2020).
32 See also below, particularly paragraph 56, for incorporation as contractual terms under the Rome I Regula-
tion, and paragraph 338, for incorporation as contractual terms of the UPICC. 
33 For examples of its application, see Mathilde Sumampouw, ed., Les Nouvelles Conventions de La Haye: Leur 
Application par les Juges Nationaux, vol. III (Dordrecht, the Netherlands, Martinus Nijhoff, 1984), pp. 15–20 (report-
ing decisions from Finland, the Netherlands and Belgium); see also the publications listed on the HCCH website. 
34 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1605, No. 28023.

the whole or part of the contract (art. 7, para. 2). In addition, the law determined 
under the Convention applies irrespective of whether or not it is the law of a 
contracting State.
51. 
The Convention was designed to replace the HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods 
Convention. Like the latter, it identifies only the law of a State as the applicable 
law, but not non-State law.
HCCH 1978 Agency Convention
52. 
The HCCH 1978 Agency Convention is aimed at establishing common pro-
visions concerning the law applicable to agency. It encompasses both commercial 
and non-commercial agency and regular and casual agency. The Convention pro-
vides choice of law rules for both the internal relationship between principal and 
agent and the external relationships between principal and third parties, and agent 
and third parties.
53. 
The law chosen by the parties is the primary rule for the internal relationship 
between principal and agent (art. 5). The internal law chosen by the parties may be 
express or implied.35 The term “internal law” indicates that only substantive law of 
the applicable State would be referred to. In addition, the law specified in the Con-
vention is to apply irrespective of whether or not it is the law of a contracting State.
54. 
The Convention is in force in three European Union member States (France, 
the Netherlands and Portugal) and in Argentina. Thus, for contracts that fall within 
its scope, the Convention takes precedence over the Rome I Regulation (see 
art. 25, para. 1).
Rome I Regulation
55. 
Article 3 of the Rome I Regulation allows the parties to choose the law of a 
State to govern their contract. Such choice may be made either expressly or tacitly, 
in regard to the whole or to only part of the contract.
56. 
While the Rome I Regulation does not allow State courts to recognize the 
choice of a non-State body of law, such as the UPICC, as governing law, it does 
not preclude parties from incorporating such rules into their contracts, subject to 
general limits on freedom of contract under the applicable contract law. The same 
applies to the choice of an international convention, such as the CISG. However, 
the CISG may be otherwise applicable under its own terms and therefore prevail 
over the Regulation.
35 The internal law of the State in which the business establishment of the agent was located at the time of the 
relevant acts is to govern the two external relationships (arts. 11 and 15). 
16 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
Mexico Convention
57. 
The Mexico Convention also recognizes the parties’ freedom to choose the 
law applicable to their international contract. The law chosen may relate to the 
whole or to only part of the contract. Such choice may be express or result from 
the parties’ behaviour and the overall terms of the contract. 
58. 
The Convention has adopted a more flexible approach towards the applica-
tion of non-State law. In applying the State law governing the contract, the court, 
in accordance with article 10, is to take into account certain categories of non-State 
law, including guidelines, customs and principles of international commercial law, 
as well as commercial usages and generally accepted practices.36
HCCH Principles
59. 
In line with today’s generally accepted principle of party autonomy, the 
HCCH Principles give effect to a choice by the parties (art. 2, para. 1) not only 
of State law as the law governing their international contract but also (under certain 
conditions, as further discussed in paragraph 71 below) of non-State law (art. 3). 
The law chosen may relate to the whole or to only part of the contract, and differ-
ent laws may be chosen for governing different parts of the contract (art. 2, para. 2). 
No connection is required between the law chosen and the parties or the transac-
tion (art. 2, para. 4). Such choice may be express or appear clearly from the provi-
sions of the contract or the circumstances (art. 4). 
60. 
The “rules of law” (i.e., non-State law) chosen by the parties must meet cer-
tain criteria, a measure that is intended to afford greater legal certainty (for details, 
see paragraph 71 below). 
61. 
Since the HCCH Principles can serve as a model for national legislators, they 
may be adopted as a domestic body of choice of law rules. The effect of such an 
adoption would be that, for matters litigated in a forum in that State, the forum 
would give effect to a choice of transnational non-State law. 
Interplay of choice of law and dispute resolution method (including choice  
of forum)
62. 
The PIL rules determine the legal rules that govern the parties’ rights and 
obligations. Since those rules may differ from State to State, it is essential to deter-
mine the applicable law when a dispute arises since the application of the law of 
one State rather than another may in some cases change the outcome of a dispute. 
36 See also the Guide on the Law Applicable to International Commercial Contracts in the Americas, in particular, 
paragraph 194. 
III. Determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts  
17
Yet, it is equally important for parties to assess the effectiveness of their choice of 
law before concluding the contract, so that they can determine their rights and 
obligations under the proposed contract before entering into it and thereby lower 
the probability of a dispute arising later. Assessing the effectiveness of the choice 
of law before the conclusion of the contract may also avoid surprises later if the 
parties had different assumptions as to which law would govern. The effectiveness 
of a choice of law is closely related to the method of dispute resolution chosen by 
the parties.
63. 
In arbitration, the parties’ choice, which can include transnational non-State 
law, is generally upheld by arbitral tribunals all over the world. In contrast, when 
parties decide to submit their future disputes to State courts, they should choose 
a forum which gives full effect to their choice of law agreement.
64. 
It is worth noting that an agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction 
on a court37 or an arbitral tribunal to determine disputes under the contract is not 
in itself equivalent to a tacit choice of law (see, for example, article 4 of the HCCH 
Principles and article 7 of the Mexico Convention). Nevertheless, when a choice 
of law has not been expressly made or clearly demonstrated, a choice of court 
agreement may be a factor to be taken into account in determining whether the 
circumstances lead to the conclusion that the parties made a tacit choice of the 
law applicable to the contract (see, for example, recital 12 of the Rome I Regulation 
and the commentary on article 4 of the HCCH Principles).
Model Clauses for the Use of the Unidroit Principles of International 
Commercial Contracts
65. 
The Model Clauses for the Use of the Unidroit Principles of International 
Commercial Contracts, adopted in 2013, are a guidance document on how parties 
to a contract may refer to the UPICC. Unlike binding instruments, which are appli-
cable whenever the contract at hand falls within their scope and the parties have 
not excluded their application, the UPICC, being a “soft-law” instrument, offer a 
greater range of possibilities to parties, of which they may not always be fully aware. 
This is the reason behind the preparation of model clauses that parties may wish 
to adopt in order to indicate more precisely how they would like the UPICC to 
be used, either during the performance of the contract or when a dispute arises.
37 In this regard, the HCCH Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements is aimed at ensuring 
the effectiveness of exclusive choice of court agreements between parties to international commercial transactions. 
For more information on that Convention, see the HCCH website. Recognition and enforcement of judgments 
deriving from a non-exclusive choice of court agreement will be governed by the HCCH Convention of 2 July 
2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters. For more 
information on that Convention, see the HCCH website.
18 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
66. 
The Model Clauses for the Use of the Unidroit Principles of International 
Commercial Contracts reflect the different ways in which the UPICC have been 
referred to by parties or applied by judges and arbitrators. They are divided into 
four categories, according to whether their purpose is: (a) to choose the UPICC 
as the rules of law governing the contract; (b) to incorporate the UPICC as terms 
of the contract; (c) to refer to the UPICC to interpret and supplement the CISG 
when the latter is chosen by the parties; or (d) to refer to the UPICC to interpret 
and supplement the applicable domestic law. The commentaries under each model 
clause detail their advantages and disadvantages, and point to possible modifica-
tions that parties may wish to introduce, depending on their intent. Where appro-
priate, for each model clause, two versions are proposed, one for inclusion in the 
contract (“pre-dispute use”) and one for use after a dispute has arisen (“post- 
dispute use”).38
HCCH Principles
67. 
The HCCH Principles are a non-binding soft-law instrument containing gen-
eral principles and rules concerning choice of law in international contracts. They 
recognize that giving effect to party autonomy at the global level is key to  promoting 
cross-border commercial transactions, as it enhances certainty and predictability 
in respect of the parties’ contractual arrangements.
68. 
The main purpose of the HCCH Principles is to reinforce the parties’ free-
dom to choose the law applicable to international commercial contracts and to 
ensure that the law chosen has the widest scope of application, subject to limited 
exceptions (preamble, first paragraph). 
69. 
The HCCH Principles provide rules only for situations in which the parties 
have made a choice of law (express or tacit) by agreement. As opposed to the 
Rome I Regulation and the Mexico Convention, which contain provisions dealing 
with the law applicable in the absence of a choice, the HCCH Principles do not 
contain a comprehensive body of rules for determining the law applicable to inter-
national commercial contracts.
38 It is important to note that the purpose of the Model Clauses for the Use of the Unidroit Principles of 
International Commercial Contracts is merely to allow parties to indicate more precisely the way they wish the 
UPICC to be used. Thus, even if parties decide not to use the Model Clauses, judges and arbitrators may still 
apply the UPICC according to the circumstances of the case, as indicated in the UPICC preamble. For more 
information on the UPICC and their intended use, see chapter IV, section C, below.
III. Determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts  
19
70. 
The HCCH Principles are composed of a preamble and 12 articles. While 
some provisions of the HCCH Principles reflect an approach that enjoys wide 
international consensus (e.g., arts. 2, para. 1, and 11), other provisions reflect the 
view of the HCCH as to best practice and provide helpful clarifications for those 
legal systems that accept party autonomy (e.g., arts. 2, paras. 2–4, 4, 7 and 9). The 
HCCH Principles also contain innovative provisions (e.g., arts. 3, 5, 6 and 8).
71. 
One of the most prominent features of the HCCH Principles is the provision 
in article  3 that expressly allows the parties to choose “rules of law” (i.e., trans-
national or non-State law) to govern their contract. However, such rules of law 
must be qualified as generally accepted on an international, supranational or 
 regional level as a neutral and balanced set of rules. They will include international 
treaties and conventions, as well as non-binding instruments formulated by estab-
lished international bodies. Instruments such as the UPICC and the CISG (that 
is, the CISG when applied as the law designated by the parties, as opposed to its 
application as a treaty) meet the conditions set forth in article  3. The HCCH 
Principles are, however, silent regarding the application of trade usages. 
72. 
Party autonomy, as recognized by the HCCH Principles, is not absolute. As 
in the law of all jurisdictions that recognize party autonomy, the HCCH Principles 
impose limitations on it. Under article 11, a court or arbitral tribunal may decline 
to give effect to the law chosen by the parties in the exceptional circumstances 
where such law contravenes overriding mandatory rules or public policy (ordre 
public) of the forum or of a third State (for more details, see para. 100 below).
73. 
The HCCH Principles may serve a harmonizing purpose, since they can be 
adopted as a legislative model in those jurisdictions willing to modernize their PIL 
rules with regard to contracts. Paraguay and Uruguay, which have already passed 
laws inspired by the HCCH Principles, are examples (see para. 47 above).
74. 
The HCCH Principles may also provide guidance to courts and arbitral tri-
bunals as to how to approach issues concerning the choice of law in international 
contracts. Lastly, they may be useful for parties and their counsel in assessing the 
law or rules of law that may be effectively chosen.
75. 
Thus, as a non-binding instrument, the HCCH Principles may be used: (a) in 
the arbitral context; (b) in the case where they supplement the PIL rules of a given 
State; or (c) where a State has adopted them as its PIL rules for international 
contracts.

Application of PIL rules in the absence of a parties’ choice
76. 
Although most international contracts state the parties’ choice of the law to 
be applied to the contract, in some instances, such a choice may not have been 
made39 or may not be enforceable. The adjudicator must then determine the law 
applicable to the contract by means of PIL rules. 
77. 
The rules governing the determination of the law applicable in the absence 
of a choice by the parties may vary in accordance with the method of dispute reso-
lution chosen by the parties.
Arbitral setting
78. 
In the absence of a choice of law agreement, or in the case of the invalidity 
of such an agreement, arbitrators enjoy a substantial degree of discretion in deter-
mining the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, including both State law 
and non-State “rules of law”. 
79. 
Under a number of arbitration rules and laws, the arbitral tribunal may directly 
determine the law applicable to the merits of the case, without resort to PIL rules 
(e.g., ICC Arbitration Rules, art. 21, and French Code of Civil Procedure, art. 1511). 
This is called the voie directe method.
80. 
On the other hand, rules such as article 28, paragraph 2, of the UNCITRAL 
Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and section 46, paragraph 3, 
of the English Arbitration Act state that the tribunal shall apply the law determined 
by the conflict of laws rules that it considers applicable. 
81. 
In practice, as arbitrators must provide reasons for their decisions, they often 
resort to PIL rules to determine the law applicable in the absence of a choice. 
Judicial setting
82. 
In determining the law applicable in the absence of a choice, State courts 
apply the PIL rules of the forum, which may be international, supranational or 
domestic rules. It should be noted that the majority of domestic PIL systems do 
not authorize the adjudicator to apply transnational non-State law to govern the 
39 It is important to note that the choice can be made expressly or tacitly. The determination of such choice 
depends on the applicable law (see, for example, HCCH Principles, art. 4).

contract in the absence of a choice. However, this has not prevented State courts 
from referring to non-State law for other purposes, for example, interpretation of 
the applicable State law, or filling gaps in that law.40 
Uniform PIL instruments
83. 
In the absence of the parties’ choice, the HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Conven-
tion applies the main rule that the law of the country in which the seller’s business 
establishment or habitual residence is located at the time of receipt of the buyer’s 
order will govern the contract of sale (art. 3). Should the seller have more than one 
business establishment in different countries, the business establishment receiving 
the order is the relevant one. A similar approach has been adopted in the HCCH 
1986 Sales Convention, article 8 of which provides for additional connecting factors. 
In terms of the HCCH 1978 Agency Convention, three main connecting factors 
have a claim to apply to the agency relationship between the principal and the agent 
in a situation in which both parties have their own business establishment: (a) the 
law of the State in which the agent acts; (b) the law of the State in which the busi-
ness establishment of the principal is located; and (c) the law of the State in which 
the business establishment of the agent is located (art. 6). 
84. 
The Mexico Convention adopts a general criterion to be followed by the 
judge in determining the governing law. According to article 9, the contract shall 
be governed by the law of the State with which it has the closest ties. In determin-
ing the law applicable under this provision, the court must take into account not 
only the objective and subjective elements of the contract, but also general prin-
ciples of international commercial law recognized by international organizations, 
such as the UPICC. 
85. 
The Rome I Regulation presents a complex regime for determining the law 
applicable in the absence of a choice. Pursuing the goal of legal certainty, the Regu-
lation sets out, in articles 4 to 8, a variety of rules relating to specific contracts, such 
as sale of goods, provision of services, franchise and distribution agreements, con-
tracts of carriage, consumer and insurance contracts, and individual employment 
contracts. For example, article 4, paragraph 1 (a), of the Regulation states that the 
sale of goods shall be governed by the law of the country in which the habitual 
residence of the seller is located.41 In that case, under article 1, paragraph 1 (b), of 
the CISG, the CISG applies when the habitual residence of the seller is in a State 
that is a party to the CISG, unless that State has lodged a  declaration that article 1, 
paragraph 1 (b), does not apply. 
40 See paras. 351–353 below; and for case law, see the UNILEX database.
41 The place of habitual residence is defined in article 19 of the Rome I Regulation.
22 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
86. 
Article 4, paragraphs 2–4, of the Rome I Regulation lays down general rules 
based on characteristic performance of the contract or closest connections to deter-
mine the law applicable in the absence of a choice. 
87. 
The HCCH Principles do not cover situations in which the parties have not 
chosen the law applicable to the contract. In the light of the diversity of rules 
 regarding this subject, there is currently no international consensus (with the 
 exception of the HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Convention) with respect to the 
rules that determine the applicable law in the absence of a choice.
National laws
88. 
Determination of the law applicable in the absence of a choice may result in 
different solutions according to the choice of law rules employed by the adjudica-
tor. In this context, some jurisdictions have more flexibility than others. 
89. 
For example, certain jurisdictions apply the law of the place of performance 
as the governing law (lex loci executionis), whereas others apply the law of the 
country where the contract has been concluded (lex loci celebrationis). Others apply 
subsidiary connecting factors in cases where these factors cannot be determined. 
90. 
Most modern legal systems have a more flexible rule to the effect that the 
law of the jurisdiction of “closest connection” should govern the contract. However, 
they differ on what is meant by the “closest connection”. Some national laws estab-
lish a number of factors to be taken into account, while others presume the “closest 
connection” to be the law of the habitual residence of the party having to perform 
the characteristic obligation. Other legal systems presume the “closest connection” 
to be the place of the conclusion of the contract or the place of performance of 
the contract.

C. Mandatory rules and public policy
Are there limits on the application of the law 
chosen by the parties? 
91. 
As indicated above, parties to contracts of sale are generally free to choose the 
law governing the contract and to agree on their terms. However, the application of 
the parties’ chosen law may be limited by mandatory rules and public policy.
92. 
In PIL, overriding mandatory rules should be distinguished from ordinary 
mandatory rules of contract law (i.e., those that cannot be derogated from by agree-
ment) in that they represent rules of fundamental importance in the legal system 
in which they operate. While ordinary mandatory rules apply only to the extent 
that they are part of the applicable law, overriding mandatory rules apply irrespec-
tive of the law otherwise applicable to the contract.
93. 
Overriding mandatory rules are legal provisions enacted by a State, contained 
in an international treaty or emanating from a supranational body (for example,  
article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), and applicable 
irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract. These rules vary from 
one system to another, as they relate to sensitive issues deserving special protection 
or regulation (e.g., consumer protection, competition law, currency and corruption). 
Therefore, overriding mandatory rules establish important limitations to the principle 
of party autonomy and may prevent forum shopping in sensitive areas. However, 
mandatory rules are seldom explicitly identified as such. Often, case law identifies 
which rules are mandatory. In some jurisdictions, the notion of mandatory rules is 
unknown or unused; however, judges achieve the same result by using doctrine that 
allows the court to decline the application of laws that violate public policy. These 
limitations may in practice hinder legal predictability if judicial precedents inter-
preting a certain legal provision do not exist or are not easily accessible. 
94. 
The notion of public policy (ordre public) expresses a mechanism protecting 
the basic values of the forum’s legal system against the application of a foreign law. 
By preventing the application of a foreign law – chosen by the parties or deter-
mined in accordance with PIL rules – the public policy exception produces effects 
similar to those of overriding mandatory rules. Under the public policy exception, 
the application of a foreign law is barred by the adjudicator on the grounds that 
its application in the particular case would be inconsistent or repugnant to the 
fundamental policies of the forum or another legal system whose law would apply 
to the contract in the absence of the parties’ choice. It is an exceptional yet neces-
sary device to avoid results which may offend a country’s fundamental concepts 
of social, economic or political justice. 
24 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
95. 
Many international or regional PIL instruments deal with both overriding 
mandatory rules and public policy.
96. 
Article 11 of the Mexico Convention contains a general rule stating that the 
provisions of the law of the forum must be applied when they are mandatory require-
ments. It also establishes the adjudicator’s discretion to decide on the application 
of mandatory provisions of the law of another State with which the contract has 
close ties. 
97. 
Article 18 of the Mexico Convention allows for the exclusion of the applica-
tion of the law designated by the Convention “when it is manifestly contrary to 
the public order of the forum”.
98. 
Article 9, paragraph 1, of the Rome I Regulation has further elaborated on 
the notion of mandatory rules, namely “overriding mandatory provisions”. Respect 
for the provisions is regarded as crucial by a country in order to safeguard its public 
interests, such as its political, social or economic organization. The provisions are 
applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law other-
wise applicable to the contract. Article 9, paragraph 3, of the Regulation allows for 
the exceptional application of the overriding mandatory provisions of a third coun-
try, provided that the obligations arising out of the contract have to be or have 
been performed in that country and that those overriding mandatory provisions 
render the performance of the contract unlawful. 
99. Article 21 of the Rome I Regulation states that “the application of a provision of 
the law of any country specified by this Regulation may be refused only if such applica-
tion is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (ordre public) of the forum”.
100. Article 11 of the HCCH Principles establishes the exceptional circumstances 
in which the parties’ choice of the governing law can be limited. Article 11, para-
graphs 1 and 2, addresses overriding mandatory provisions of law, with paragraph 1 
establishing the forum’s discretion to apply its overriding mandatory provisions, and 
paragraph 2 indicating the circumstances in which the forum may apply mandatory 
provisions of another State. Article 11, paragraphs 3 and 4, addresses fundamental 
notions of public policy (ordre public), with paragraph  3 establishing the forum’s 
discretion to exclude the application of the chosen law if it contravenes the forum’s 
fundamental notions of public policy and paragraph 4 indicating the circumstances 
in which the forum may take into account fundamental notions of public policy of 
another State. Finally, article 11, paragraph 5, addresses the application of overriding 
mandatory provisions and public policy (ordre public) by arbitral tribunals.
101. Similar rules can be seen in other HCCH choice of law instruments: article 6 of 
the HCCH 1955 Sales of Goods Convention; articles 16 and 17 of the HCCH 1978 
Agency Convention; and articles 17 and 18 of the HCCH 1986 Sales Convention.
III. Determination of the law applicable to international commercial contracts

102. 
The UPICC contain, in article 1.4, a broad rule addressing the prevalence 
of mandatory rules over the UPICC. It states that nothing in the UPICC shall 
restrict the application of mandatory rules, whether of national, international or 
supranational origin, which are applicable in accordance with the relevant PIL rules 
(see para. 341 below).
103. 
The UPICC, in their article 1.5, use the term “mandatory rules” also in a 
different meaning, referring to certain UPICC internal provisions that cannot be 
derogated from or excluded by the parties (see para. 389 below). It is true that, 
given the non-binding character of the UPICC, the non-observance of the manda-
tory provisions may have no consequences. It is, however, considered an important 
guidance for contracting parties and adjudicators, especially when the UPICC are 
chosen as the governing law. Table 2 below sets out selected mandatory rules 
within the UPICC and the CISG.

Article 9 of the Electronic Communications Convention establishes mini-
mum standards for the functional equivalence between electronic communications 
and form requirements that may exist under the applicable law. These form require-
ments may be considered of mandatory application in certain jurisdictions. 
105. 
The principle of party autonomy contained in article  3 of the Electronic 
Communications Convention does not empower the parties to set aside statutory 
requirements on the form or authentication of contracts and transactions. Thus, 
article 9 of the Convention should not be understood as allowing the parties to go 
as far as relaxing statutory requirements on signature in favour of methods of authen-
tication that provide a lesser degree of reliability than electronic signatures.

IV. Substantive law of 
international  sales
A. United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods
1. 
Scope of application – bases for applying the CISG
When is a sale international?
What contact or connection between the sales transaction and a 
contracting State will trigger the application of the CISG? 
106. 
The CISG is a hard-law instrument applicable to the international sale of 
goods. It is binding on parties, judges and arbitrators when the conditions set out 
in the instrument itself, and particularly in its article  1, paragraph  1, are met. A 
sale of goods is defined as “international” when the contracting parties have their 
places of business in different States. If parties have more than one place of busi-
ness, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract 
and its performance. No other test, for example, with regard to the nationality of 
the parties or to the civil or commercial character of the parties or of the contract 
is required to determine the internationality of the sales contract.
107. 
The provisions in article 1, paragraphs 1 (a) and (b), describe the relation-
ship between the sales transaction and contracting State that triggers the application 
of the CISG. The Convention will apply if the States in which both parties have 
their places of business are contracting States or if PIL rules lead to the application 
of the law of a contracting State.
108. 
The application of the CISG may be excluded by agreement of the parties  
(art.  6). Moreover, a contracting State may lodge a declaration under article  95 
that excludes the application of the CISG through the application of PIL rules.42
42 For the status and text of the declarations made by contracting States to the CISG, see the United Nations 
Treaty Collection website.
28 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
109. In accordance with article 1, paragraph 2, when facts that would reveal that 
the sale is international are not apparent to the parties at the time of the conclusion 
of the contract, the internationality is to be ignored in determining whether the Con-
vention applies. Thus, for example, when a sales contract is concluded by an agent 
for one party without disclosure that the principal’s place of business is in a different 
State from the other party, the contract is not governed by the Convention.
Does the CISG always apply in a contracting State?
110. 
Exceptions to the application of the CISG may occur if the CISG is in force 
only in some territorial units of a contracting State (art. 93) and if some contracting 
States have declared that they share the same or closely related legal rules on matters 
governed by the Convention (art. 94). Currently, the latter declaration applies to 
contracts concluded between parties having their place of business in Denmark, 
Finland, Iceland, Norway or Sweden. 
What is a contract for sale under the CISG and  
what are goods under the CISG?
111. 
Most of the time, what constitutes a contract for sale under the Convention 
is obvious; however, there are circumstances in which more explanation or analysis 
is required. The same applies to what constitutes goods under the CISG. 
112. 
Articles 1 and 3 of the CISG identify transactions to which the Convention 
applies. A definition of a sales contract under the CISG is achieved by resorting 
to the provisions that typically characterize the obligations of the parties under the 
contract, namely, articles 30 and 53 of the CISG: the seller has to deliver the goods 
and the buyer has to receive them and pay the agreed price. 
113. 
Article 3, paragraph 1, of the CISG expands upon the traditional definition 
of the sales contract found in certain legal traditions, which characterizes the seller’s 
obligation as an obligation to give (dare), as opposed to other contracts, such as 
work, services or construction contracts, in which the obligation is an obligation 
to do (facere). Under article 3, paragraph 1, of the CISG, the obligation of the seller 
is not solely characterized as an obligation to give, but also includes an obligation 
to do. The CISG thus considers as a “sales contract” a contract for the supply of 
goods to be manufactured or produced by the seller with materials provided by 
the seller or by the buyer if the latter does not provide a substantial part of the 
materials necessary for such manufacture or production. 
114. 
Article 3, paragraph 2, addresses the application of the CISG to mixed con-
tracts, namely, contracts for sales in which the seller’s obligations include a duty 
to provide labour or other services as well as goods. It provides that the Convention 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
29
applies to such contracts unless the supply of labour or services constitutes the 
“preponderant part” of the obligations of the party that furnishes the goods. How-
ever, services or work needed to manufacture or produce the goods under article 3, 
paragraph 1, do not count for the purpose of article 3, paragraph 2. 
115. For the possible application of the CISG to distribution contracts, see chapter V, 
section B, below; to barter or countertrade transactions, see chapter V, section E, below. 
116. 
The use of new technologies has raised a number of issues regarding the 
substantive scope of the CISG, in particular in the realm of computer software and 
data. Contracts with respect to software and data may raise issues as to whether 
they are contracts for sale or whether the subject matter of the sale is goods (see 
chap. V, sect. D, below).
117. 
Six specific categories of international sales are excluded from the scope of 
the Convention. Those mentioned in article 2, paragraph (a), concern sale of goods 
to buyers who acquire them for personal, family, or household use; in most countries, 
such sales are characterized as consumer transactions and are governed by specific 
rules, often of a mandatory nature. Article 2, paragraphs (b) and (c), relate to sales 
by auction or on execution or otherwise by authority of law, which may raise issues 
regarding the formation of the contract and the seller’s consent. All these exclusions 
are based on the specific nature of the transaction; the remaining exclusions (art. 2, 
paras. (d)–(f)) are based on the nature of the goods. Under those paragraphs, sales 
of shares and other securities, as well as money, sales of ships, vessels, hovercraft 
or aircraft, and contracts for the sale of electricity, are excluded from the scope of 
the Convention. However, the supply of gas and oil and other energy sources are 
not excluded from the scope of the CISG by article 2. 
What matters are governed by the CISG?
118. 
Once the applicability of the CISG is decided, the next issue to consider is 
what matters are governed by the CISG. Articles 4 and 5 deal expressly with this 
issue. Matters that are governed by the CISG are addressed exclusively by the express 
provisions or general principles underlying the CISG. Only when no provision or 
general principles can be found will the domestic law apply, in accordance with 
article 7 (see paras. 127–132 below). 
119. 
Article 4 provides that the CISG governs two of the most important matters 
that arise in contracts of sale of goods. The first is whether and when a contract 
has been concluded. The second is the rights and obligations of the seller and buyer 
arising from the contract. Domestic law notions such as consideration and causa 
are not relevant for the CISG. Rights and obligations of third parties are not governed 
by the CISG.
30 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
120. 
Article 4, paragraph (a), provides that the CISG is not concerned with two 
matters. The first is the validity of the contract, any of its provisions, or any usage 
(for the application of usages, see para. 139 below). Under the CISG, validity is to 
be distinguished from formation of the contracts. The question of whether a con-
tract is to be invalidated arises only after a contract is concluded. Examples in 
domestic law of such invalidation rules include rules on public policy, mistake, 
fraud, threat or incapacity.43
121. 
The second matter with which the CISG is not concerned is the effect of 
the contract on the property in the goods sold (art. 4, para. (b)). The question of 
how and when the property passes from the seller to the buyer is to be decided 
by the applicable domestic law.
122. 
However, there is an important exception to article 4, paragraphs (a) and (b), 
of the CISG. Article 4 provides that the CISG is not concerned with validity and 
property “except as otherwise expressly provided in this Convention”. For  example, 
some domestic legal systems may allow a contract to be invalidated owing to a 
mistake as to the quality of the goods. However, since the CISG has explicit rules 
on delivery of non-conforming goods, the CISG governs this matter to the exclusion 
of domestic laws.
123. 
The liability of the seller for death or personal injury caused by the goods 
to any person is not governed by the CISG (art. 5). Since death and personal injury 
deal with extracontractual interests, they are issues that are better dealt with in 
accordance with the public policy decisions of each contracting State. Thus, domestic 
rules on product liability between sellers and buyers apply even if the contract of 
sale is governed by the CISG as far as they concern death or personal injury. This 
includes death or personal injury caused by labour or other services provided by 
the seller, if that contract is a sales contract under article  3, paragraph  2, of the 
CISG. However, sums paid by the buyer as compensation for the death or personal 
injury of a third person caused by goods or services supplied by the seller may be 
regarded as claims for pecuniary loss of the buyer.
Can the CISG be chosen as governing sales law and  
what role can the UPICC play in this context?
124. 
Under the principle of party autonomy, parties may make the CISG appli-
cable when it would not otherwise apply (opting in as non-State law).44 In such 
43 The UPICC filled this gap and contain a detailed set of provisions on the validity of contract, including 
avoidance for mistake, fraud and threat, a provision on gross disparity, a provision on illegality and express rules 
on restitution in the case of avoidance (see paras. 370–372 below).
44 For a more thorough discussion of this point, see paragraphs 40-61 above.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
31
cases, the CISG will be regarded as a body of rules of law (HCCH Principles, 
art. 3). If the CISG would not apply on its own terms (i.e., if the conditions of 
article 1, paragraph 1, are not met), its choice as applicable law would be limited 
by restrictions that PIL rules may impose on the choice of non-State rules of law 
to govern the contract (see paras. 45–47 above).
125. 
Under article  2, paragraph  2, of the HCCH Principles, the parties may 
choose more than one law to govern their contract. Accordingly, the parties may 
choose both the CISG and the UPICC as the governing laws. In doing so, the 
parties may refer to the Model Clauses for the Use of the Unidroit Principles of 
International Commercial Contracts. Depending on the choice made by the par-
ties, the UPICC may play the limited role of background law, as opposed to the 
primary role played by the CISG.45 
Can the parties derogate from the CISG or vary its rules?
126. 
One of the underlying principles of the CISG is party autonomy. As estab-
lished in article 6, the parties are free not only to exclude the Convention but also 
to derogate from or vary the effect of its provisions, at the time of or after the 
conclusion of the contract (see, however, para. 29 and table 2 above).
How is the CISG to be interpreted?
How are the gaps in the contract filled?
What are general principles within the CISG?
127. 
Article 7 provides a framework for the uniform and international interpreta-
tion of the CISG. It is aimed at avoiding a distortive interpretation and application 
of the CISG resulting from interference with domestic laws, case law and doctrinal 
traditions. 
128. 
The autonomous interpretative criterion is based upon the principles of inter-
nationality, uniformity and good faith (CISG, art.  7, para.  1). The autonomous   
gap-filling method is to be applied according to the same general principles inherent 
to the CISG (CISG, art. 7, para, 2). 
129. 
Similarly to the UPICC (see para. 387 below) and other uniform texts, the 
CISG pursues the goal of uniform interpretation. Terms and concepts used must 
be interpreted autonomously.46 Therefore, the meaning of the vast majority of the 
45 See, in particular, model clauses 3 (a) and (b), and paragraphs 65–66 above.
46 These principles apply to several uniform texts: see, for example, comment 2 to article 1.6 of the UPICC.
32 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
CISG terms is to be found within the CISG and not in domestic laws. In order to 
achieve the goal of uniform interpretation, domestic courts and arbitral tribunals 
applying the CISG in different jurisdictions tend to consider cases issued by other 
courts when interpreting the CISG.
130. 
Article 7 minimizes the need to apply PIL rules and rules of domestic sub-
stantive law. When a question concerning a matter governed by the Convention is 
not expressly settled in it, the question is to be settled in conformity with the 
general principles on which the Convention is based. Only in the absence of such 
principles is the interpreter referred to the domestic law determined by the choice 
of law rules; hence, recourse to domestic law is the last resort.
131. 
In practice, a significant number of general principles to be found within 
the CISG have been developed by case law. 
132. 
Whether and to what extent external principles may play a role in filling 
gaps in the CISG, in the absence of an agreement of the parties, is an open issue. 
In the case of the relationship between the CISG and the UPICC, the common 
understanding is that the UPICC are not, as such, considered to be the general 
principles of the CISG, but rather as being able to serve to corroborate the exist-
ence of a given general principle and, thus, they can be a tool to interpret the CISG 
(CISG, art. 7, para. 1) or to fill its gaps (CISG, art. 7, para. 2), whenever there is 
no conflict between the two instruments (see paras. 353 and 394 below). 
What are the rules for the interpretation of the contract?
133. 
Article 8 of the CISG addresses interpretation of statements and other con-
duct of a party to a contract. This article, which displaces the application of domes-
tic laws on interpretation of such statements and conduct, can play an important 
role in determining the meaning of a contract.
134. 
Article 8, paragraph 1, of the CISG states a preference for the interpretation 
of unilateral statements and conduct in accordance with the intention of the party 
speaking or acting so long as the other party knew or could not have been unaware 
of the intent of the party speaking or acting. 
135. 
If the intention of the party speaking or acting is not known to the other 
party or the other party could not have been aware of that intent, then, under 
article 8, paragraph 2, of the CISG, the statements or conduct are to be interpreted 
in accordance with the understanding that a reasonable person of the same kind 
as the other party would have had in the same circumstances.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
33
136. 
Article 8, paragraph 3, of the CISG mandates a contextual approach to ascer-
taining the intent of a party or the understanding that a reasonable person would 
have. It does so by requiring that due consideration be given to “all relevant cir-
cumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices which the parties 
have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the 
parties”.
137. 
Chapter 4 of the UPICC contains a more detailed set of rules on contractual 
interpretation. Article 4.1 contains a general provision on the interpretation of the 
contract according to the common intention of the parties or, if a common inten-
tion cannot be established, according to the meaning that reasonable persons of 
the same kind as the parties would give to it in the same circumstances. Articles 
4.3 and 4.4 endorse the contextual approach followed by the CISG. The UPICC 
also expressly address additional issues such as the interpretation of terms supplied 
by one party (through the contra proferentem rule), linguistic discrepancies and 
supplying omitted terms (see paras. 373 and 394 below).
What is the role of practices and usages? 
138. 
The determination of the content of an international sale of goods contract 
is left to party autonomy that can shape its content in accordance with the needs 
of each specific transaction within the limits derived by mandatory rules. In practice, 
parties may draft a very long and detailed contract or exchange offer and accept-
ance indicating only the fundamental elements of the contract. In any case, the 
question is how gaps in the contract are to be filled.
139. 
The CISG considers in this regard the importance of practices and usages. 
Article 9 of the CISG (in the same way as article 1.9 of the UPICC)47 refers to 
three situations that are different in name, content and effect: (a) practices established 
between the parties; (b) agreed usages; and (c) usages and customs of international 
trade. Practices and agreed usages have a bilateral effect and are thus binding only 
to the extent that they are reflected in the habitual conduct of the parties in their 
business relationship or in the agreement of the parties concerned. Well-established 
and widely recognized international usages of trade enjoy a presumption of general 
knowledge and tacit acceptance as their existence is disconnected from a specific 
commercial operation. 
140. 
All three become an integral part of the contract and bind the parties, usually 
during the formation of the contract, either by express or implied agreement. The 
rest of the terms of the contract would be filled by the CISG itself through its 
default provisions. 
47 On article 9 of the CISG and article 1.9 of the UPICC, see also paragraph 394 below.
34 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
141. 
Usages and practices have another important role within the CISG as an 
interpretative criterion for the contract (art. 8, para. 3).
142. Article 4, paragraph (a), of the CISG excludes from the scope of the Convention 
issues in regard to the validity of any usage.
What is the interplay between the CISG and the ICC Incoterms? 
143. 
The ICC Incoterms are a set of widely accepted definitions for the most 
commonly used terms of trade for the sale and purchase of goods. They describe 
the allocation of certain obligations, risks and costs between the buyer and the seller, 
including with respect to import and export formalities and transport. In contract 
practice, the Incoterms rules are incorporated into contracts for the sale of goods 
and help provide clarity and reduce uncertainties and risks for sellers and buyers.
144. 
First published in 1936 by the ICC, the Incoterms have been updated regu-
larly to reflect current trade practices. The latest version is the Incoterms 2020. 
145. 
The Incoterms 2020 feature 11 rules. Seven of them (EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, 
DAP, DPU and DDP) are rules for any mode or modes of transport, while the 
remaining four (FAS, FOB, CFR and CIF) are rules for sea and inland waterway 
transport:
(a) 
“Ex Works” (EXW) means that the seller delivers when it places the goods 
at the disposal of the buyer at the seller’s premises or at another named place (works, 
factory, warehouse, etc.). The seller does not need to load the goods onto any col-
lecting vehicle or clear the goods for export, where such clearance is applicable;
(b) “Free Carrier” (FCA) means that the seller delivers the goods to the carrier 
or another person nominated by the buyer at the seller’s premises or another named 
place. The parties are well advised to specify as clearly as possible the point within 
the named place of delivery, as the risk passes to the buyer at that point;
(c) “Carriage Paid To” (CPT) means that the seller delivers the goods to the 
carrier or another person nominated by the seller at an agreed place (if any such 
place is agreed between parties) and that the seller must arrange or contract for and 
pay the costs of carriage necessary to bring the goods to the named place of 
destination;
(d) “Carriage and Insurance Paid to” (CIP) means that the seller delivers the 
goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the seller at an agreed place (if 
any such place is agreed between parties) and that the seller must arrange or contract 
for and pay the costs of carriage necessary to bring the goods to the named place of 
destination. The seller also contracts for insurance cover against the buyer’s risk of 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
35
loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage. The buyer should note that, under 
CIP, the seller is now required to obtain insurance of a higher level than in the past, 
in line with the Institute Cargo Clauses (A) or similar clauses. Buyers wishing to 
have more insurance protection have to either expressly agree as much with the sellers 
or make their own extra insurance arrangements;
(e) “Delivered at Place” (DAP) means that the seller delivers when the goods 
are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for 
unloading at the named place of destination. The seller bears all risks involved in 
bringing the goods to the named place;
(f) “Delivered at Place Unloaded” (DPU) means that the seller delivers when 
the goods, once unloaded from the arriving means of transport, are placed at the 
disposal of the buyer at a named place of destination. The seller bears all risks in-
volved in bringing the goods to and unloading them at the place of destination;
(g) “Delivered Duty Paid” (DDP) means that the seller delivers the goods when 
the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer, cleared for import on the arriving 
means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. The seller 
bears all the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods to the place of destination 
and has an obligation to clear the goods not only for export but also for import, to 
pay any duty for both export and import and to carry out all customs formalities;
(h) 
“Free Alongside Ship” (FAS) means that the seller delivers when the goods 
are placed alongside the vessel (e.g., on a quay or a barge) nominated by the buyer 
at the named port of shipment. The risk of loss of or damage to the goods passes 
when the goods are alongside the ship, and the buyer bears all costs from that 
 moment onwards;
(i) “Free on Board” (FOB) means that the seller delivers the goods on board 
the vessel nominated by the buyer at the named port of shipment or procures the 
goods already so delivered. The risk of loss of or damage to the goods passes when 
the goods are on board the vessel, and the buyer bears all costs from that moment 
onwards;
(j) “Cost and Freight” (CFR) means that the seller delivers the goods on board 
the vessel or procures the goods already so delivered. The risk of loss of or damage 
to the goods passes when the goods are on board the vessel. The seller must contract 
for and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of 
destination;
(k) “Cost, Insurance and Freight” (CIF) means that the seller delivers the goods 
on board the vessel or procures the goods already so delivered. The risk of loss of or 
damage to the goods passes when the goods are on board the vessel. The seller must 
contract for and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named 
port of destination. The seller also contracts for insurance cover against the buyer’s 
36 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
risk of loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage. The buyer should note 
that, under CIF, the seller is required to obtain insurance only on minimum cover. 
Buyers wishing to have more insurance protection have to either expressly agree as 
much with the sellers or to make their own extra insurance arrangements.
146. 
Under the CISG, the ICC Incoterms have been considered both as agreed 
usages and practices established between the parties, and as trade usages. There is 
an important interplay between the CISG and the Incoterms with regard to delivery, 
passing of risk and payment. The use of the Incoterms does not entirely displace 
the CISG rules on the passing of the risk, as it is only a partial derogation of the 
CISG (art.  6). In addition, the Incoterms do not deal with, among others, the 
formation of the contract, the buyer’s payment obligations or, most notably, remedies 
for breach of contract.
147. 
Trade terms may also be defined differently from the ICC Incoterms with 
respect to business sectors or in domestic law.48 It is therefore advisable to correctly 
identify the intended trade term.
How can the place of business be determined under the CISG?
148. 
As the CISG refers to a party’s place of business in several provisions,49 
defining which of the party’s multiple “places of business” is the main place of 
business is relevant to promote legal certainty and predictability in applying the 
Convention.
149. 
According to article 10, paragraph (a), if a party has more than one place 
of business, the relevant place of business for the purposes of the Convention is 
that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance. Thus, 
if the party has multiple places of business, it is not always the principal one that 
is relevant in determining whether a contract is governed by the CISG.50 When 
the party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to habitual 
residence rather than to domicile. 
150. 
By way of example, article 10 of the CISG has been interpreted to consider 
the seller’s relevant place of business to be the construction site where the contract 
had been concluded and where the equipment was to be picked up by the buyer.51 
48 For example, the United States Uniform Commercial Code, article 2, paragraph 320, defines the trade term CIF.

Does the CISG have any form requirements?
151. 
The CISG does not require any particular form, such as in writing, or any 
special requirements, such as a signature, for the conclusion of the contract. 
152. 
Form, as considered in the CISG, has its own autonomous and uniform 
meaning; thus, even if the issue of form is a matter of validity under domestic law, 
article 11 prevails and the domestic requirements such as the statute of frauds or 
any other form requirement are irrelevant. 
153. 
The principle of freedom of evidence also applies and the contract can be 
evidenced by any means including witnesses, thus displacing domestic evidentiary 
rules such as those that exclude oral testimony (“parole evidence rule”).
154. 
The weight to be given to the evidence is a matter to be left to the judge or 
arbitrator and thus the probative value of the evidence is to be assessed in accord-
ance with the procedural laws or rules of law and on a case-by-case basis. 
155. 
Parties might well expressly or impliedly agree on the exclusion or derogation 
of the principle of informality under article 11 of the CISG by virtue of article 6 of 
the CISG or by a no-oral-modification (NOM) clause that excludes oral agreements 
for the modification of the contract (art. 29). NOM clauses are expressly referred to 
in the UPICC, which contain specific provisions on them (see para. 395 below). 
156. 
States may lodge a declaration under article 96 of the CISG, the effect of 
which is to trigger the application of article  12 and therefore the written form 
requirement. The article 96 declaration applies to article 11, to the communications 
in part II relating to the formation of the contract (arts. 14–24) and to the modi-
fication and termination of the contract by agreement (art. 29) with respect to the 
form of the contract and of other communications, and also with regard to their 
evidence.
When and how is a contract concluded under the CISG? 
157. 
Part II of the CISG regulates the formation of an international sales contract 
considering rules for the offer (arts. 14–17) and acceptance (arts. 18–22).52 A con-
tract is concluded when an acceptance of an offer becomes effective by reaching 
52 The CISG provisions on the formation of the contract, and particularly those relating to the offer and the 
acceptance, are among those provisions which were followed in the UPICC with no or limited adaptations. 
However, specific rules for matters not expressly dealt with in the CISG, such as writings in confirmation, contracts 
with terms deliberately left open and incorporation of standard terms, were introduced in the UPICC. There are 
also rules covering bad faith and breaches of confidentiality during the negotiations leading up to the conclusion 
of the contract. See paras. 368 and 394–397 below.
38 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
the offeror (arts. 23 and 24). There are no rules for determining the place of con-
clusion of the contract and, thus, this issue is left to the otherwise applicable law.
158. 
Part II applies when offer and acceptance may not be easily identified. It 
applies also to the modification of the contract and its avoidance (termination) 
following the offer and acceptance process.
When is a proposal to conclude a contract an offer?
159. 
Under the CISG, in order for a proposal for concluding a contract to con-
stitute an offer, it must be addressed to one or more specific persons and it must 
be sufficiently definite. For an offer to be considered sufficiently definite, it must 
indicate the goods and expressly or implicitly fix or make provisions for determin-
ing the quantity and the price (art. 14, para. 1). Offers to the general public are 
considered an invitation to make an offer, unless the contrary is clearly indicated 
by the person making the proposal (art. 14, para. 2).
160. 
Under the CISG, the parties may agree that the contract is concluded only 
when certain specific matters are agreed besides those considered under article 14, 
paragraph 1, of the CISG. 
Is an open-price contract valid under the CISG?
161. 
Article 14 of the CISG indicates that the price must be determined in the 
offer, while article 55 of the CISG establishes a method to determine this element 
by applying the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract 
for such goods sold under comparable circumstances in the trade concerned. In 
the case of open-price contracts, the apparent contradiction between articles 14 
and 55 of the CISG is usually solved by the performance of the contract. Instances 
in which the contract has not been performed may be problematic.
Can an offer be withdrawn or revoked?
162. 
The CISG distinguishes between withdrawal (art. 15), revocation (art. 16) 
and termination (art. 17) of the offer. The offer also expires when it is not accepted 
within the time fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a reasonable time (art.  18, 
para. 2). 
163. 
An acceptance is the positive response to an offer. It must be made clearly 
and unconditionally by the acceptor. Acceptance can take place by means of a 
statement, conduct or, in qualified circumstances, silence or inaction (art.  18, 
para. 1). 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
39
164. 
Unless the offeror sets out a specific form of acceptance, the offeree is free 
to accept the offer either orally (in person, over the phone, etc.) or in writing, 
including by electronic means (a letter, telegram, telex, fax, email, etc.). In both 
circumstances, for the acceptance to be effective and, in turn, the contract be con-
cluded, it must reach the offeror within the time period established in the offer or, 
in the absence of such provision, within a reasonable time (art. 18, para. 2). 
165. 
In the case of oral offers, the CISG requires that the acceptance be immediate, 
unless the circumstances indicate otherwise (art. 18, para. 2).
166. 
Acceptance can also take place by means of conduct or by acts of perfor-
mance. When acceptance occurs by conduct (such as raising a hand and nodding 
one’s head), the contract is concluded when notice of such conduct reaches the 
offeror, i.e., when the offeror learns of it. If the acceptance takes place through acts 
of performance (for example, by delivering the goods and paying the price), it is 
not necessary to make a notification of acceptance, since the very act of delivery 
or payment concludes the contract as long as it is made within the time set by the 
offeror for acceptance, or within a reasonable time if no such period is set. Never-
theless, to be able to accept through acts of performance without the need for 
sending a communication to the offeror, it is necessary that the offer allows for 
such (i.e., “begin manufacturing”, “send immediately”, “buy in my name without 
delay”, or “make payment to my account number”) or that it is permitted by virtue 
of established practices of the contracting parties or by usage (art. 18, para. 3). 
167. 
An acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror be-
fore or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective (art. 22).
Can an offer be accepted by silence or inaction?
168. 
Silence or inactivity do not in themselves amount to acceptance (art. 18, 
para. 2). However, silence or inactivity, along with other factors, could amount to 
an acceptance of the offer. This may happen by application of a legal provision 
(arts. 19, para. 2, and 21); by application of a usage of trade or of a practice estab-
lished between the parties (art. 9); or where in some circumstances the silence of 
the addressee of a letter of confirmation that purports to modify an oral contract 
might amount to an acceptance. 
What is a counter-offer?
169. A frequent problem in contract formation arises out of a reply to an offer that 
purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms. Article 19 
of the CISG makes a distinction between those terms that materially alter the terms 
of the offer (counter-offer) and those that do not (acceptance). 
40 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
170. 
In order to determine when an element that is introduced in an acceptance 
materially alters the offer, thereby preventing the conclusion of the contract, or not, 
the following list of elements is provided in the CISG: price, quality and quantity 
of merchandise, place and time of delivery, the extent of one party’s liability to the 
other and the settlement of disputes. 
171. 
Although the CISG does not have special rules dealing with the use of 
standard terms, namely, provisions prepared in advance for general and repeated 
use by one party and which are actually used without negotiation with the other 
party as defined in article 2.1.19, paragraph 2, of the UPICC, case law has generally 
considered the use of standard terms under the CISG, mainly its articles 8 and 
14–24, in relation to the question of whether the standard terms are incorporated 
into the contract.
Does the CISG govern the “battle of the forms”?
172. 
Although the CISG does not contain an express provision on the issue 
known as “battle of the forms”, it is generally accepted that it is a matter governed 
by it. The “battle of the forms” refers to a situation in which the parties exchange 
general conditions (pre-printed forms) that add one or more terms that materially 
modify the offer. The general conditions in the two forms generally contain con-
tradictions and, in the case of dispute, the question arises of whether a contract 
has been concluded and, if so, what the terms of that contract are. If a contract has 
been validly concluded, the rules most commonly applied to address the battle of 
the forms are the “last-shot rule”, namely, the last form used by the parties prevails; 
and the “knock-out rule”, according to which contradictory clauses contained in 
the standard forms are out of the content of the contract, which is the solution 
expressly adopted in article 2.1.22 of the UPICC. It has not been settled in case 
law applying the CISG which one of these two solutions should prevail.53
How is the contract modified?
173. 
Under the CISG, a contract may be modified or terminated by the mere 
agreement of the parties (art. 29, para. 1). Modification and termination generally 
follow the same pattern of contract conclusion, namely, offer and acceptance, and 
domestic law concepts such as consideration are not relevant in this area. If a NOM 
clause (see para. 155 above) is included within the contract, it may not be orally 
modified or terminated by agreement. However, the conduct of one party may 
preclude that party from asserting such a provision to the extent that the other 
party has relied on that conduct (art. 29, para. 2).

of Goods, article 19.

2. 
Obligations of the parties (including passing of risk and 
preservation of goods) 
174. 
Part III, chapters II and III, of the CISG adopt a simple structure of defining 
the obligations of the parties, and then providing remedies available for the other 
party in the case of breach of any of those obligations. The obligations of the seller 
are listed in article 30 and elaborated upon in articles 31 to 44, which also include 
provisions on the buyer’s duty to examine the goods and to give notice of lack of 
conformity of the goods to the seller (arts. 38–44). The obligations of the buyer 
are listed in article 53 and further elaborated upon in articles 54 to 60. 
175. 
 The question of when the risk of loss passes from the seller to the buyer is 
closely related to the seller’s obligation because it defines whether a loss of or damage 
to the goods amounts to a breach of the seller’s obligation. Part III, chapter IV, of 
the CISG deals with the question of passing of risk. In addition, the seller or buyer 
may be required to preserve the goods when risk of loss is on the other party. Rules 
on the duty to preserve the goods are provided in part III, chapter V, section VI.
176. 
In practice, parties often use shorthand trade terms, such as FCA, FOB, CPT 
and CIF, to indicate the allocation of certain obligations, risks and costs as between 
the seller and buyer under the contract in accordance with the ICC Incoterms, 
which provide definitions for EXW (E terms); FCA, FAS and FOB (F terms); CPT, 
CIP, CFR and CIF (C terms); and DAP, DPU and DDP (D terms). For the interplay 
between the CISG and the ICC Incoterms in general, see paragraph 146 above.
What are the obligations of the seller under the CISG?
177. 
The general obligations of the seller are to deliver the goods, hand over any 
documents relating to the goods and transfer the property in the goods, as required 
by the contract and the CISG (art. 30). The obligation to deliver the goods includes 
obligations to deliver goods that are in conformity with the contract and to deliver 
goods that are free from any right or claim of third parties. 
Where should the goods be delivered and how? 
Are there special rules for a contract involving carriage of goods?
178. 
In international sale of goods, the parties often agree to engage independent 
carriers for the delivery of goods. These arrangements are known as sales that 
 “involve carriage of goods”. In such cases, the seller is obligated to hand the goods 
over to a carrier at a certain place and the buyer is obligated to take delivery of the 
goods from the carrier at the destination of the carriage, which is not necessarily 
the same location as the buyer’s place of business. If the seller agrees in the contract 
42 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
to deliver at the buyer’s place of business, that is not a contract involving carriage 
of goods for the purpose of the CISG, even if the seller engages an independent 
carrier. This is because, in this case, the seller’s obligation to deliver is not fulfilled 
by handing the goods over to an independent carrier, but by placing the goods at 
the buyer’s disposal at the buyer’s place of business.
179. 
The rights and obligations of the carrier and consignor or the holder of 
transport documents (e.g., bills of lading) are not governed by the CISG (see 
art. 4). They are governed by the law applicable to the contract of carriage or the 
bills of lading. In most cases regarding international carriage of goods, uniform 
laws are applicable. For carriage by sea, they are either the Hague-Visby Rules 
regime, established by the International Convention for the Unification of Certain 
Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading (1924) (the 1924 Brussels Convention)54 
and various protocols amending it,55 or the Hamburg Rules regime, established 
by the United  Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea (1978).56 
For international carriage by air, the most relevant instrument is the Convention 
for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (1999) 
 (Montreal Convention).57 Uniform law instruments relating to land and inland 
waterway transport include the Convention on the Contract for the International 
Carriage of Goods by Road (1956) (CMR),58 the Budapest Convention on the 
Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterway (2001) (CMNI)59 and 
the Uniform Rules concerning the Contract of Inter national Carriage of Goods 
by Rail (CIM), which are under the framework of the Convention concerning 
International  Carriage by Rail (1980) (COTIF).60
180. 
Under the CISG, if the contract of sale involves carriage of goods, the seller’s 
obligation is to hand over the goods to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer 
(art.  31, para.  (a)). Once this is done, the obligation of the seller to deliver the 
goods has been fulfilled, except that the seller must further give the buyer notice 
of the consignment specifying the goods if the goods are not clearly identified to 
the contract by markings on the goods, shipping documents or otherwise (art. 32, 
para. 1). The duty to give notice of consignment under article 32, paragraph 1, also 
applies when it is the buyer that arranges for the carriage, if the seller’s delivery 
obligation consists of handing over the goods to the carrier (e.g., FOB and FCA 
contracts).

181. 
In practice, parties often agree on a different place (e.g., port of shipment) 
where the goods are to be handed over to a carrier, whether it is the first carrier 
or not. This is done either by use of trade terms, such as the ICC Incoterms FCA, 
FOB, CFR or CIF, or otherwise. In such cases, that agreement prevails (art. 6).
182. 
When the contract of sale involves carriage of goods, there is also the ques-
tion of who arranges for the contract of carriage and insurance in respect of the 
carriage of the goods. The CISG does not directly answer these questions. 
183. 
However, the CISG provides that, if the seller is bound by the contract to 
arrange for the carriage of the goods, the seller must make such contracts as are 
necessary for carriage to the place fixed by means of transportation appropriate in 
the circumstances and according to the usual terms for such transportation (art. 32, 
para. 2). 
184. 
The ICC Incoterms clarify when the seller has the obligation to arrange for 
the contract of carriage (i.e., C terms), and when it does not (i.e., F terms). When 
the seller is bound to arrange for the contract of carriage, the Incoterms rules 
provide that the contract of carriage must be made on usual terms at the seller’s 
cost and provide for carriage by the usual route in the customary manner normally 
used for carriage of the type of goods sold. When the seller is not bound to arrange 
for the contract of carriage, the seller must provide the buyer with the information 
that the buyer needs for arranging the carriage.
185. 
With respect to insurance, if the seller is not bound to effect insurance in 
respect of the carriage of the goods, the seller must, at the buyer’s request, provide 
the buyer with all available information necessary to enable the buyer to effect such 
insurance (art. 32, para. 3). This applies irrespective of whether it is the seller or 
the buyer who arranges for the carriage. 
186. 
According to the ICC Incoterms, the seller must obtain cargo insurance 
under CIP and CIF terms, but not under other trade terms. Under other terms 
relating to sale involving carriage (F terms and CPT and CFR), the seller has no 
obligation to make a contract of insurance but must provide the buyer with the 
information that the buyer needs to obtain insurance.
187. 
If the contract of sale does not involve carriage of goods, the seller is obli-
gated to deliver the goods by placing them at the buyer’s disposal. The seller fulfils 
the obligation to “place the goods at the buyer’s disposal” by doing everything 
possible to enable the buyer to take over (i.e., to take possession of) the goods.
188. 
The place at which the goods are to be placed at the buyer’s disposal de-
pends on the following distinction: in principle, that place is the place of business 
44 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
of the seller at the time of the conclusion of the contract (art. 31, para. (c)); how-
ever, if (a) the contract relates to specific goods, or unidentified goods to be drawn 
from a specific stock or to be manufactured, and (b) the parties knew at the time 
of the conclusion of the contract that the goods were at a particular place, or that 
the goods were to be manufactured or produced at a particular place, the place of 
placing the goods at the buyer’s disposal is that place (art.  31, para.  (b)). If the 
parties agree on a different place of delivery, that agreement prevails (art. 6).
189. 
If the parties use E or D terms according to the Incoterms rule, they have 
agreed on a different place of delivery for contract not involving carriage.
Cost of delivery
190. 
Although the CISG does not have an express provision on bearing of cost 
of performance, the relevant trade usage (art. 9), or the general principle under-
lying the CISG (art. 7, para. 2), is that the cost of delivery must be borne by the 
seller, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. This rule corresponds to the provision 
contained in the UPICC on cost of performance (art. 6.1.11).61 The seller bears 
the costs necessary for delivery (e.g., packaging, measuring, weighing the goods). 
The seller bears the costs of transportation only to the place of delivery. If the 
seller’s obligation to deliver is to hand the goods over to the first carrier (art. 31, 
para. (a)), the seller does not bear the transportation cost beyond that point. Like-
wise, if the buyer is to collect the goods at a particular place (art. 31, paras. (b) 
and (c)), the seller does not bear the cost of transportation beyond that place. 
191. 
The ICC Incoterms contain more specific rules on the allocation of various 
costs relating to delivery or transport documents, export and import clearance, and 
checking, packaging and marking of goods.
When should the goods be delivered?
192. 
Under the CISG, if there is a date of delivery fixed by the contract or deter-
minable from the contract, the seller is obligated to deliver on that date (art. 33, 
para. (a)). If there is a period of time for delivery that is fixed by the contract or 
determinable from the contract, the seller is obligated to deliver within that period 
but may deliver at any time within that period unless circumstances indicate that 
the buyer is to choose a date (art. 33, para. (b)). In any other case, the seller must 
deliver within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract (art.  33, 
para. (c)).
61 Article 6.1.11 of the UPICC indicates that parties shall bear the costs of the performance of the respective 
obligations, unless otherwise agreed.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
45
Late delivery
193. 
If the seller does not deliver by or on those dates, the seller is in breach of 
the contract. It is not necessary for the buyer to demand delivery to put the seller 
in breach. 
Early delivery
194. 
Delivery earlier than the fixed date or period for delivery is also a breach 
of the seller’s obligation, even if the buyer takes delivery of the goods (art.  52, 
para. 1). 
Seller’s obligation to deliver conforming goods
195. 
The goods that the seller delivers must be of the quantity, quality and descrip-
tion required by the contract; the goods must also be contained or packaged in the 
manner required by the contract (art. 35, para. 1). Packaging is particularly impor-
tant in international sale of goods in order to protect the goods from loss or damage 
during shipment. Thus, the Incoterms rules also generally consider packaging in the 
manner appropriate for transport to be the obligation of the seller.
Quantity
196. 
With respect to quantity, the delivery of not only a quantity smaller than 
that provided for by the contract but also a quantity greater than that provided for 
by the contract constitutes lack of conformity. The seller is still in breach, even if 
the buyer takes delivery of the excess quantity. In that case, the buyer must pay for 
the excess quantity it took at the contract rate (art. 52, para. 2), but the buyer is 
also entitled to remedies, such as damages for loss caused by the excess delivery. 
Quality
197. If the parties have not agreed on the quality of the goods, conformity is 
 determined according to certain criteria. The goods do not conform to the contract 
unless they: (a) are fit for the purposes for which goods of the same description 
would ordinarily be used (fitness for ordinary purpose, art. 35, para. 2 (a)); (b) are 
fit for any particular purpose expressly or impliedly made known to the seller at 
the time of the conclusion of the contract (fitness for particular purpose, art.  35, 
para. 2 (b)); or (c) possess the qualities of goods which the seller has held out to 
the buyer as a sample or model (art. 35, para. 2 (c)). The rule in article 35, para-
graph 2 (b) does not apply when the circumstances show that the buyer did not 
rely on the seller’s skill or judgment (e.g., if the buyer made the choice), or that it 
was unreasonable for the buyer to rely on the seller’s skill and judgment (e.g., the 
46 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
seller did not claim to be an expert). However, the seller is not liable under arti-
cle 35, paragraph 2 (a)–(c), for any lack of conformity if, at the time of the conclusion 
of the contract, the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack of 
conformity (art. 35, para. 3).
Packaging
198. 
Likewise, it is possible that the parties have not agreed on the manner of 
how the goods are to be contained or packaged. In that case, the goods do not 
conform with the contract unless they are contained or packaged in the manner 
usual for such goods or, where there is no such manner, in a manner adequate to 
preserve and protect the goods (art.  35, para.  2 (d)). However, the seller is not 
liable under article 35, para. 2 (d), for any lack of conformity of the packaging if, 
at the time of the conclusion of the contract, the buyer knew or could not have 
been unaware of such lack of conformity (art. 35, para. 3). 
199. 
In practice, depending on the flexibility of contract interpretation (art. 8), 
the determination based on article  35, paragraphs 1 and 2, can be blurred. It is 
more advantageous for the buyer to rely on article 35, paragraph 1, because the 
seller is not liable under article 35, paragraph 2, for any lack of conformity of the 
goods if, at the time of the conclusion of the contract, the buyer knew or could 
not have been unaware of such lack of conformity (art. 35, para. 3).
Relevant time for determination of conformity
200. 
The relevant time for determination of conformity is the time when the risk 
passes to the buyer (art. 36, para. 1). The time of passing of risk is determined accord-
ing to articles 67 to 69, or according to the parties’ agreement (e.g., inclusion of trade 
terms according to the Incoterms). It is not necessary for the lack of conformity to 
be apparent at the time of passing of risk; its existence may be discovered later.
201. 
Lack of conformity which occurs after the passing of risk can also give rise 
to the seller’s liability. This is when the lack of conformity was due to a breach of 
any of the seller’s obligations (art. 36, para. 2). Typically, this is the case if the lack 
of conformity occurred notwithstanding a guarantee by the seller that for a period 
of time the goods would remain fit for their ordinary purpose or for some particular 
purpose or would retain specified qualities or characteristics.
Seller’s right to cure
202. 
The seller has a right to cure lack of conformity. If the seller has delivered 
goods before the date for delivery, the seller may, up to that date, deliver any 
 missing part or make up any deficiency in the quantity of the goods delivered, or 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
47
deliver goods in replacement of any non-conforming goods delivered or remedy 
any lack of conformity in the goods delivered, provided that the exercise of this 
right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable  expense 
(art. 37). The seller has a similar right to cure after the delivery date (art. 48). 
203. 
However, even if the seller cures the lack of conformity, it does not change 
the fact that the delivered goods lacked conformity and, therefore, the buyer retains 
any right to claim damages as provided for in the CISG (arts. 37 and 48, para. 1).
204. 
The UPICC contain a provision on the right to cure by the non-performing 
party in article 7.1.4 that is couched in more general terms so as to apply to all 
contracts. It lists the conditions and limits under which cure is admitted and clari-
fies the relationship with the exercise of other remedies (see para. 379 below).
What should the buyer do to preserve rights deriving from  
non-conformity of the goods?
205. 
The buyer must examine the goods, or cause them to be examined, within 
as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances (art. 38, para. 1). Generally, 
the period commences when the seller delivers the goods. However, if the contract 
involves carriage of the goods, examination may be deferred until after the goods 
have arrived at their destination (art.  38, para.  2). In addition, if the goods are 
redirected in transit or redispatched by the buyer without a reasonable opportunity 
for examination, and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew 
or ought to have known of the possibility of redirection or redispatch, examination 
may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at the new destination (art. 38, 
para. 3).
206. 
There is no independent sanction for not conducting this examination. How-
ever, failure to examine the goods may lead to grave results for the buyer. Article 38 
is to be read in conjunction with article 39 (explained in paragraphs 207–209 below) 
that deprives the buyer of any right to remedy for lack of conformity if the buyer 
does not give notice to the seller. Namely, the time that the buyer should have 
examined the goods under article 38 is the time under article 39, paragraph 1, that 
the buyer “ought to have discovered” the lack of conformity. The length of “as short 
a period as practicable in the circumstances” depends on various factors, such as 
giving reasonable opportunity to the buyer to examine the goods, the nature of the 
goods (for example, perishable or durable, seasonal or not), the frequency of the 
transaction and practices established between the parties and usages.
207. 
The buyer has a duty to give notice to the seller of any lack of conformity 
of the goods. Buyers lose all the rights to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods 
if they do not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the lack of 
48 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
conformity within a reasonable time after they have discovered the lack of conformity 
or ought to have discovered it (art.  39, para.  1). The determination of what is a 
reasonable period of time depends on various factors (see para. 206 above). There is 
also an absolute cut-off period of two years from the date when the goods were 
actually handed over to the buyer (art. 39, para. 2). This cut-off period applies even 
if the buyer could not have discovered a hidden lack of conformity within that 
period. However, the parties may extend or shorten the two-year time limit by agree-
ing on a different contractual period of guarantee (art. 39, para. 2). These time limits 
are not to be confused with the “limitation period”, which concerns the period 
within which legal proceedings need to be commenced (see chapter IV, section B, 
below, on the Limitation Convention).
208. 
The main purpose of giving notice to the seller is to enable the seller to 
cure the lack of conformity. Thus, if the lack of conformity relates to facts of which 
the seller knew or could not have been unaware, and which the seller did not 
disclose to the buyer, the seller cannot rely on the buyer’s failure to give notice in 
accordance with article 39 (art. 40).
209. 
The rigidity of the duty of examination and notification is somewhat eased 
by an exception provided in article 44. If buyers have a reasonable excuse for their 
failure to give the required notice, they may still resort to price reduction in accord-
ance with article 50 or claim damages, except for loss of profit. However, it should 
be noted that this exception does not apply to the two-year time limit under 
 article 39, paragraph 2. Therefore, the two-year time limit is absolute.
Is the seller obliged to deliver goods which are free from  
any right or claim of a third party?
What are the buyer’s duties in this respect?
210. 
The seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a 
third party, unless the buyer agreed to take the goods subject to that right or claim 
(art.  41). The right or claim of a third party under article  41 includes property 
rights such as ownership (i.e., sale of third party’s property) or security rights that 
hinder the use or disposal of the goods by the buyer, but not intellectual property, 
which is dealt with under article 42. The right or claim of a third party need not 
be substantiated. Thus, even if the buyer acquires full ownership of the goods 
accord ing to domestic property law protecting good faith purchasers, the seller is 
still liable under the CISG if the owner makes any claim against the buyer. This is 
because, particularly in international sales, the buyer should not be expected to 
deal with third parties, which are usually in a foreign State. 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
49
211. 
The seller is obligated to deliver goods that are free from rights of a third 
party that existed at the time of delivery. Third-party claims include those raised 
only after the time of delivery as long as they are based on rights that existed at 
the time of delivery.
Intellectual property
212. 
If the right or claim of the third party is based on industrial property or 
other intellectual property, the seller’s obligation is governed by article 42. As is 
the case with other rights or claims under article 41, the seller must deliver goods 
which are free from any right or claim of a third party based on intellectual prop-
erty. However, the nature of intellectual property requires special treatment. 
213. 
Although intellectual property rules are increasingly being harmonized 
under World Intellectual Property Organization treaties, owing to the principle of 
territoriality in intellectual property law, infringement of intellectual property could 
still be determined differently according to the laws of each State. Thus, it is par-
ticularly significant in the international sale of goods to ascertain which law is to 
be used to determine whether the seller has fulfilled the obligation to deliver goods 
free from a third party’s right or claim based on intellectual property. The CISG 
provides that it is the law of the State in which the goods will be resold or other-
wise used, if it was contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of 
the contract that the goods would be resold or otherwise used in that State (art. 42, 
para. 1 (a)). If such use was not contemplated by the parties, it is the law of the 
State in which the place of business of the buyer is located (art. 42, para. 1 (b)).
214. 
The seller is obligated to deliver goods that are free from any right or claim 
based on intellectual property of a third party that existed at the time of delivery. 
However, the liability is limited only for intellectual property rights of which the 
seller knew or could not have been unaware at the time of the conclusion of the 
contract (art.  42, para.  1). This is a requirement unique to intellectual property 
that does not exist under article 41.
215. 
Furthermore, the obligation of the seller to deliver goods free from any right 
or claim based on intellectual property of a third party does not extend to cases 
in which: (a) the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of the right or claim 
at the time of the conclusion of the contract; or (b) the right or claim results from 
the seller’s compliance with technical drawings, designs, formulae or other such 
specifications furnished by the buyer (art. 42, para. 2).
216. 
As is the case in lack of conformity regarding quantity, quality or description 
of goods, buyers lose the right to rely on the provisions of article 41 or 42 if they 
do not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the right or claim of the 
50 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
third party within a reasonable time after they have become aware or ought to have 
become aware of the right or claim (art. 43, para. 1). 
217. 
The seller is not entitled to rely on the buyer’s failure to give timely notice 
if the seller knew of the right or claim of the third party and the nature of it (art. 43, 
para. 2). There is also the same exception that the buyer may still resort to price 
reduction in accordance with article 50 or claim damages, except for loss of profit, 
if the buyer has a reasonable excuse for failure to give the required notice (art. 44). 
However, unlike the case of lack of conformity regarding quantity, quality or 
descrip tion of the goods, the buyer has no duty of examination (art. 38) and is 
not subject to the two-year time limit to give notice (art. 39, para. 2).
Does the seller have other obligations  
(handing over of documents, transfer of ownership)?
218. 
The seller must hand over any documents relating to the goods (arts. 30 
and 34). Such documents include not only documents that represent the proprietary 
right to the goods needed to claim or dispose of the goods (e.g., bills of lading, 
warehouse receipts), but also, for example, invoices, insurance policies, certificates 
of origin, certificates of quality and any other documents that the contract requires 
to be handed over. In the case of a letter of credit, the seller’s duty in respect of 
shipping documents is to present them to the bank nominated to receive them. 
Parties often specify in the contracts what these documents are, for example, by 
incorporating trade terms under the Incoterms.
219. 
In the case of documentary sales, where the seller’s obligation is to deliver 
documents that represent the proprietary right to the goods needed to claim or 
dispose of the goods (e.g., bills of lading, warehouse receipts), article 58 provides 
that the buyer must pay the price when the seller places the documents controlling 
the disposition of the goods at the buyer’s disposal (art. 58, para. 1). However, in 
principle, only after having had an opportunity to examine the goods is the buyer 
bound to pay (art. 58, para. 3). The examination under article 58, paragraph 3, is 
limited to a brief and superficial examination of the goods, unlike the examination 
under article 38. (On article 58, see paras. 246–247 below.)
220. 
The documents must conform to the contract. They must be handed over 
at the time and place and in the form required by the contract. If the seller has 
handed over documents before that time, the seller may, up to that time, cure any 
lack of conformity in the documents, as far as the exercise of this right does not 
cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense. However, the 
buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in the CISG (arts. 34, 45, 
para. 1 (b), and 74–77).
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
51
221. 
The seller must transfer the property (ownership) in the goods to the buyer 
(art. 30). If the seller is unable to transfer property in the goods because title in 
the goods is vested in another person, the seller is in breach (art. 41). 
222. 
The CISG is not concerned with how such transfer can and should be effec-
tuated (art. 4, para. (b)). That is to be determined according to the law governing 
transfer of property applicable by virtue of PIL rules (see para. 121 above).
How is the passing of risk regulated under the CISG? 
223. 
The goods identified to the contract may get lost or damaged. When that 
happens, whether the non-delivery (in case of loss) or delivery of damaged goods 
(in case of damage) amounts to a breach of the seller’s obligation to deliver goods 
depends on whether the loss or damage occurred before or after the passing of the 
risk of loss or damage.
224. 
When loss of or damage to the goods occurs after the risk of loss or damage 
has passed from the seller to the buyer, the seller is not obligated to remedy the 
loss or damage, and the buyer must pay the full price (art. 66). However, there are 
two exceptions. First, if the loss or damage is due to an act or omission of the seller, 
not delivering or delivering the damaged goods is a breach of the seller’s obligation 
to deliver the goods (art. 66). It is irrelevant whether that act or omission itself 
amounts to a breach of the seller’s obligation. Second, even if loss or damage occurs 
after the passing of the risk, if there was a fundamental breach of contract by the 
seller (whether or not it is the cause of the loss or damage), the buyer may resort 
to the remedies available to the buyer on account of such breach (art. 70). This 
includes requesting delivery of substitute goods (art.  46, para.  2) and declaring 
avoidance (termination) (art.  49, para.  1 (b)), notwithstanding the fact that the 
loss or damage occurred after the passing of risk.
225. 
On the other hand, if loss of or damage to the goods occurs before the risk 
passes to the buyer, the seller will have to deliver substitute goods. Otherwise, the 
seller will be in breach of the obligation to deliver the goods. 
226. 
It follows from the above that determination of the time when the risk 
passes is critical. The parties are free to agree on the time the risk passes. In practice, 
parties often agree on the time of passing of the risk by agreeing on a trade term 
in accordance with the Incoterms (however, the Incoterms rules do not define the 
consequences of passing of the risk). The Incoterms rules generally consider that 
the risk of loss remains with the seller until the seller has delivered the goods in 
accordance with each term. For example, under FCA, CPT and CIP, the risk passes 
when the goods have been handed over to or placed at the disposal of the carrier; 
under FOB and CIF, when the seller places the goods on board the vessel; and, 
52 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
under EXW, DAP and DDP, when the seller places the goods at the buyer’s disposal 
at the agreed point. If the parties have not made such an agreement, the risk passes 
under the CISG according to articles 67 and 68. From a practical viewpoint, parties 
should purchase insurance to cover their loss. 
227. 
The passing of risk is detached from the question of transfer of property. 
In general, the risk passes when the seller has done everything to deliver the goods 
and when the buyer is in a better position to control the goods. It should be noted 
that the risk does not pass to the buyer unless the goods are identified to the 
contract (arts. 67, para. 2, and 69, para. 3).
228. 
The UPICC do not have express default provisions on the passing of risk 
of loss and its consequence, in view of their broader scope of application to all 
contracts.
Passing of risk in contracts for the sale of goods involving carriage
229. 
Article 67 specifies the time of passing of the risk in cases where the contract 
of sale involves carriage of the goods. If the seller is not bound to hand them over 
to the carrier at a particular place, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are 
handed over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer in accordance with 
the contract of sale. This coincides with the manner of delivery required of the 
seller under article 33, paragraph (a). If the seller is bound to hand the goods over 
to a carrier at a particular place, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods 
are handed over to the carrier at that place (e.g., if an inland seller agrees to hand 
over the goods to a carrier at a seaport, the risk does not pass by handing over the 
goods to the first inland carrier at the seller’s place of business). The fact that the 
seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the disposition of the goods 
(e.g., bills of lading) after handing over the goods to the carrier does not affect the 
passing of the risk. In these cases, the seller has already delivered the goods, and 
the risk of loss during the entire transport is on the buyer, who is in a better position 
to establish loss or damage after the goods arrive at the destination. 
230. 
However, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identi-
fied to the contract (art. 67, para. 2). Identification may be done by markings on the 
goods, by shipping documents, by notice given to the buyer or otherwise. Identifica-
tion after shipment is particularly relevant to the sale of undivided bulk goods.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
53
Passing of risk in contracts for the sale of goods in transit
231. 
Article  68 deals with the situation where the goods already in transit are 
sold. In principle, the risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer 
from the time of the conclusion of the contract. However, if the circumstances so 
indicate (e.g., the buyer has insurance coverage for the period of entire transport), 
the risk is assumed retroactively by the buyer from the time the goods are handed 
over to a carrier that issues the documents embodying the contract of carriage. The 
document can be any document that demonstrates the existence of the contract. 
It need not be a document controlling the disposition of the goods. 
232. 
Nevertheless, if, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of sale of goods 
in transit, the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost or 
damaged and did not disclose this to the buyer, the loss or damage is at the risk 
of the seller (art. 68).
Passing of risk in all other cases
233. 
Article  69 provides the time of passing of risk for cases not covered by  
articles 67 and 68. If the buyer is to take over the goods at the seller’s place of 
business, the risk passes to the buyer upon taking over the goods (art. 69, para. 1). 
This is because the buyer is then in a position to control the disposition of the 
goods. However, if the buyer does not take over the goods in due time, the risk 
still passes from the time when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer, 
and the buyer commits a breach of contract by failing to take delivery (see arts. 53 
and 60). The time of placing the goods at the buyer’s disposal and the time the 
buyer fails to take delivery may not coincide because the seller may place the goods 
at the buyer’s disposal before the due date, or the seller was required to notify the 
buyer that the goods were placed at the buyer’s disposal. Placing the goods at the 
buyer’s disposal alone is not sufficient to pass the risk because the seller is in control 
of the goods at the place of business of the seller.
234. 
If the buyer is to take over the goods at a place other than the place of busi-
ness of the seller (e.g., the buyer’s place of business or a third party’s warehouse), 
the risk passes when delivery is due, the goods are placed at the buyer’s disposal 
at that place and the buyer is aware of that fact (art. 69, para. 2). It should be noted 
that this is different from the Incoterms rules, which generally do not make buyer’s 
awareness a requirement for passing of risk. The passing of risk under article 69, 
paragraph 2, takes place earlier than under article 69, paragraph 1,  because the seller 
is not in control of the goods. 
54 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
235. 
It should be noted, however, that the goods are not considered to be placed 
at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified to the contract (art. 69, 
para. 3).
What are the obligations of the buyer?
236. 
The general obligations of the buyer are to pay the price for the goods and 
to take delivery of them as required by the contract and the CISG (art. 53).
Obligation to pay the price
237. 
The buyer’s obligation to pay the price includes taking such steps and com-
plying with such formalities as may be required under the contract or any laws and 
regulations to enable payment to be made (art. 54). For example, if the contract 
requires payment by a letter of credit, the buyer must arrange with the bank to 
open a letter of credit. The buyer must also comply with currency exchange regula-
tions. In view of the general principle of strict liability under the CISG, a buyer 
who is unable to pay the price because the relevant authority denies permission to 
transfer funds would still be liable for non-payment, subject to the possibility of 
exemption under article 79. Parties concerned about the risk of adverse currency 
and monetary control measures may consider the UPICC, which contain a set of 
specific default rules (arts. 6.1.14–6.1.17) on the application for public permission, 
defined in broad terms, addressing the issues of which party should apply for the 
permission and which obligations derive for that party, as well as the consequences 
in terms of liability of a refusal of permission or of a situation where permission 
is neither granted nor refused.
238. 
The parties may not have expressly or implicitly fixed or made a provision 
for determining the price, even when the contract is validly concluded (see 
para. 161 above). In such cases, the parties are considered, in the absence of any 
indication to the contrary, to have impliedly made reference to the price generally 
charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under 
comparable circumstances in the trade concerned (art. 55). This interpretative solu-
tion corresponds to the default rule on price determination contained in the 
UPICC and dealing with a situation where a contract does not fix or make provi-
sions for deter mining the price (art.  5.1.7). The UPICC additionally regulate a 
situation where the contract expressly provides that the price is to be determined 
by one party, by a third person or by reference to external factors. A further express 
provision of the UPICC deals with the situation where parties have deliberately 
left contractual terms open at the time of conclusion of the contract in order for 
them to be deter mined in the future. This provision applies to price terms and is 
particularly  important for long-term contracts (see art. 2.1.14, comment 4).
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
55
239. 
If the price is fixed according to the weight of the goods, in case of doubt 
it is to be determined by the net weight, and not by the gross weight, including 
the weight of packaging (art. 56).
Currency of payment
240. The currency of payment must be the currency of payment agreed in the 
contract. The question of whether the buyer may choose to pay in a currency of the 
place of payment, if it is different from the contractual currency, is not settled under 
the CISG. The UPICC allow the choice in certain circumstances (art. 6.1.9). If the 
parties have not agreed on the currency of payment, it is not settled under the CISG 
which currency is to be used, but the determination must be made according to 
article 7, paragraph 2. On the other hand, the UPICC expressly provide that, in such 
cases, payment should be made in the currency of the place of payment (art. 6.1.10).
Method of payment
241. 
Unlike the UPICC, which have provisions on the method of payment 
(arts. 6.1.7 and 6.1.8), the CISG does not provide rules on the methods of payment. 
However, the provisions of the CISG on the place of payment (art. 57) and the 
time of payment (art. 58) assume that payment may be made by cash or by funds 
transfer. Unless the parties have agreed on the method of payment, or unless there 
is a practice established between the parties or binding usage related to the method 
of payment (see art. 9), the buyer may pay in either form. Any other form of pay-
ment, including payment by bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques or docu-
mentary letters of credit, require the agreement of the seller, either before or after 
the conclusion of the contract. 
242. 
Various uniform law instruments provide rules on payment methods. Regard-
ing funds transfer, the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Credit Transfers 
(1992)62 provides a global uniform model. Regional texts, such as the European 
Union directive on payment services,63 may also be relevant.
243. 
For payment by bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques, some coun-
tries have enacted the Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes 
and the Uniform Law for Cheques in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.64

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
The 1988 United Nations Convention on International Bills of Exchange and 
International Promissory Notes65 is not yet in force. For commercial letters of credit, 
the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP), prepared by 
the International Chamber of Commerce, provide a de facto standard. In order to 
accommodate electronic commerce, the International Chamber of Commerce has 
also developed a supplement to UCP for electronic presentation of letters of credit 
(eUCP) and Uniform Rules for Bank Payment Obligations (URBPO).
Place of payment
244. 
If the parties have agreed on the place of payment, payment must be made 
at that place. If the parties have not agreed on the place of payment, in principle,  
the buyer must make a payment to the seller at the seller’s place of business (art. 57, 
para. 1 (a)). However, if the payment is to be made against the handing over of 
the goods or of documents, payment is to be made at the place where the handing  
over takes place (art. 57, para. 1 (b)). For the place of handing over the goods, see 
paras. 178–189 above.
Cost of payment
245. 
For the same reason that the seller bears the cost of delivery (see para. 190 
above), the cost of payment is to be borne by the buyer, unless otherwise agreed. 
This corresponds to article 6.1.11 of the UPICC. However, under the CISG, the 
seller must bear any increase in the expenses incidental to payment that is caused 
by a change in its place of business subsequent to the conclusion of the contract 
(art. 57, para. 2).
Time of payment
246. 
Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer must pay the price when the seller places 
either the goods or documents controlling their disposition at the buyer’s disposal 
in accordance with the contract and the CISG (art.  58, para.  1). The seller may 
make such payment a condition for handing over the goods or documents. If the 
contract involves carriage of the goods, the seller may dispatch the goods on terms 
whereby the goods, or documents controlling their disposition, are not to be  handed 
over to the buyer except against payment of the price (art. 58, para. 2). Thus, the 
general rule is that the goods or documents and payment are to be exchanged 
simultaneously.
65 General Assembly resolution 43/165, annex.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
57
247. 
It should be noted that the CISG provides that buyers are not bound to pay 
the price until they have had an opportunity to examine the goods (art. 58, para. 3). 
However, this right to examine the goods prior to payment does not apply if the 
procedures for delivery or payment agreed upon by the parties are inconsistent 
with having such an opportunity (e.g., cash against documents). This examination 
is a short and superficial examination mostly for the purpose of detecting delivery 
of the wrong goods (aliud), apparent defects or delivery of the wrong quantity. It 
is to be distinguished from the examination of the goods in order to discover any 
lack of conformity under article 38.
248. 
Unlike the law in some jurisdictions, the buyer must pay the price on the 
date fixed by or determinable from the contract and the CISG without the need 
for any request or compliance with any formality on the part of the seller (art. 59). 
This rule is most relevant when performance of payment and delivery of goods or 
documents are not simultaneous. 
Obligation to take delivery
249. 
The buyer must take delivery of the goods. This involves not only physically 
taking over (taking possession of) the goods (art. 60, para. (b)), but also doing all 
the acts which could reasonably be expected of the buyer in order to enable the 
seller to make delivery (art. 60, para. (a)). For example, if the buyer is to arrange 
the shipment of the goods, the buyer must conclude a contract of carriage and 
provide the seller with all information necessary, such as the name of the vessel, 
to enable the seller to hand over the goods to the carrier.
Does the CISG contain rules on the preservation of goods?
250. 
In the course of events, there may be situations where one party is in pos-
session of the goods because the other party has failed to take possession of them. 
For example, the buyer may be delayed in taking over the goods, or the seller may 
have not taken them over from the buyer following rejection (e.g., request for 
delivery of substitute goods (art. 46, para. 2; see also para. 266 below), avoidance 
of the contract (arts. 49, 51 and 73; see also paras. 264–265 below) or refusal of 
early delivery (art. 52, para. 1). The CISG imposes a duty on the party in possession 
of the goods to preserve the goods by taking steps reasonable in the circumstances 
to preserve them (arts. 85 and 86, para. 1). This is done for the benefit of the other 
party as the risk of loss rests on that party (see, e.g., arts. 69 and 70).
251. 
The steps that are reasonable in the circumstances depend on factors such 
as the nature of the goods, the probability of loss or damage and the prospective 
seriousness of the loss or damage. For example, storing perishable foods in a refrig-
erator would likely be a reasonable step to be taken. If the cost of preservation is 
58 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
disproportionately high in comparison to the value of the goods, such steps would 
be unreasonable in the circumstances. The CISG provides detailed rules in connec-
tion with two examples of steps for the preservation of goods in its articles 87 and 88.
252. 
Failure to take reasonable steps to preserve the goods will result in liability 
for damages under articles 45, paragraph 1 (b), or 61, paragraph 1 (b), if the goods 
are lost or damaged.
253. 
Moreover, article 86, paragraph 2, provides that if goods dispatched to the 
buyer have been placed at the buyer’s disposal at their destination but the buyer 
exercises the right to reject them, the buyer has a duty to take physical possession 
of the goods on behalf of the seller, and then to preserve them, provided that this 
can be done without payment of the price and without unreasonable inconvenience 
or unreasonable expense. However, the duty to take possession does not arise if 
the seller, or a person authorized to take charge of the goods on the seller’s behalf, 
is present at the destination.
Deposit in a warehouse
254. 
The CISG provides two specific examples of reasonable steps to be taken 
to preserve the goods. The first is to deposit the goods in a warehouse of a third 
person at the expense of the other party (art. 87). This relieves the party owing 
the duty of preservation to store and preserve the goods. However, this is not 
 allowed when the expense is not reasonable.
Self-help sale and emergency sale
255. 
The second specific example of reasonable steps to be taken to preserve the 
goods is the so-called “self-help sale” and “emergency sale” under article 88. 
256. 
A party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with articles 85 
or 86 may sell them by any appropriate means if there has been an unreasonable 
delay by the other party in taking possession of the goods (e.g., buyer’s delay in 
taking over the goods) or in taking them back (e.g., seller’s delay in taking back 
the goods when the contract was avoided) or in paying the price or the cost of 
preservation (art. 88, para. 1).
257. 
Self-help sale does not have to be a judicial sale: the sale can take place 
privately on the market. The only restriction is that the sale is by appropriate means. 
If the goods are sold by inappropriate means, liability in damages will result. 
258. 
If the goods are subject to rapid deterioration (e.g., perishables) or their 
preservation would involve unreasonable expense (e.g., feeding of animals), a party 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
59
who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with articles 85 or 86 must take 
reasonable measures to sell them (art.  88, para.  2). Unlike self-help sale under 
article 88, paragraph 1, emergency sale is a duty of the party bound to preserve 
the goods.
259. 
As is the case with self-help sale under article 88, paragraph 1, emergency 
sale can take place privately on the market, as long as the measure of selling the 
goods is reasonable. If the measure is not reasonable, that will result in liability for 
damages. Given the urgency of the matter in emergency sales, terms less favourable 
than those tolerated under article 88, paragraph 1, can be considered reasonable 
under article 88, paragraph 2.
What are the remedies available to the seller and the buyer 
under the CISG?
When is a party exempt from liability?
260. 
Articles 30 and 53 summarize the obligations of the seller and the buyer, 
respectively, under the CISG. While the seller must deliver the goods, hand over 
any documents relating to them and transfer the property in the goods, the buyer 
must pay the price for the goods and take delivery of them, as required by the 
contract and the Convention. 
261. 
The CISG contains additional obligations addressed to the seller (e.g., 
art.  35 on the seller’s obligation to deliver conforming goods) and the buyer. A 
breach of contract under the CISG exists when any obligation deriving from the 
CISG or the parties’ agreement has been infringed. 
262. 
Given the unitary approach of the CISG to contract breach, in principle, 
every breach triggers the same remedies. However, the remedies provisions in the 
CISG occasionally refer to particular categories of breaches. The CISG contains 
separate provisions governing the buyer’s remedies for breach of contract by the 
seller (arts. 45–52) and the seller’s remedies for breach of contract by the buyer 
(arts. 61–65). In both cases, the aggrieved party may claim damages as provided 
in articles 74 to 77. 
263. 
The CISG rules on remedies strongly influenced the provisions of the UPICC 
on remedies (chap. 7). The UPICC, however, contain a number of additional provi-
sions covering issues not expressly settled by the CISG (see paras. 379–381 below).
60 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
Avoidance of the contract
264. 
The severe remedy of contract avoidance – equivalent to termination under 
the UPICC terminology (see para. 381 below) – requires, in general, that a funda-
mental breach has occurred. The CISG – as well as the UPICC – privileges the 
preservation of the agreement (favor contractus) and the need to minimize transac-
tion costs. A breach is fundamental when it substantially deprives the non-breaching 
party of what it is entitled to expect under the contract (art. 25).66 The definition 
of a fundamental breach can be made only in the light of the parties’ contract and 
the circumstances of each particular case. In general, the case law establishes a high 
threshold for the avoidance of the contract on the grounds of fundamental breach. 
Parties may define what constitutes a fundamental breach in the contract. 
265. 
In addition, the sales contract can be avoided when an additional period of 
time for performance has lapsed: (a) without delivery of the goods by the seller 
(art. 49, para. 1 (b)), in which case the buyer may declare the contract avoided; 
or (b) in a situation of non-payment or failure to take delivery by the buyer (art. 64, 
para. 1 (b)), in which case the seller may declare the contract avoided.
Other remedies available to the buyer
266. 
In addition, in the case of breach, the buyer has the right to require specific 
performance of the seller’s obligations (art. 46, para. 1). Under article 28, the rem-
edy of specific performance is subject to its availability under the law applicable to 
the court or arbitral proceedings where the remedy is sought. Article 7.2.2 of the 
UPICC contains detailed provisions on specific performance that may be helpful 
in situations envisaged by article  28 of the CISG. Delivery of non-conforming 
goods by the seller triggers the buyer’s right to claim delivery of substitute goods 
(art. 46, para. 2) but only when the breach is deemed fundamental. The buyer may 
also require that the seller repair the non-conforming goods (art. 46, para. 3). 
267. 
Reduction of the contract price (art. 50) is also available to the buyer in 
the case of non-delivery of conforming goods.
268. 
The remedies provided for in articles 46 to 50 are subject to special rules 
(art. 51) in situations of partial delivery. 
269. 
The buyer has further rights not explicitly mentioned in articles 46 to 52, 
if the contract is breached by the seller. Such rights include remedies in the case of 
66 The corresponding provision in the UPICC (art. 7.3.1) contains a non-exhaustive list of additional elements 
to be considered when determining whether there is a fundamental non-performance.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
61
anticipatory breach and instalment contracts (arts. 71–73) and the right to withhold 
performance of the buyers own obligations, in particular, payment of the agreed price. 
Other remedies available to the seller
270. 
When the contract is breached by the buyer, the seller may require the buyer 
to pay the price, take delivery or perform the other obligations, unless the seller 
has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement (art.  62). 
These remedies fall under the general category of specific performance.
271. 
The contract may be avoided by the seller if the failure of the buyer to perform 
any of the obligations under the contract or the CISG amounts to a fundamental 
breach (art. 64, para. 1 (a)). It may also be avoided if the buyer does not perform 
the obligation to pay the price or take delivery of the goods within the additional 
period of time fixed by the seller in accordance with article 63, paragraph 1.
272. 
Finally, when the buyer fails to specify the form, measurement or other 
features of the goods, as provided in the contract, the seller may make the specifica-
tion in accord ance with the requirements of the buyer that may be known to the 
seller (art. 65).
How are damages regulated under the CISG?
273. In the case of breach of contract, the most important CISG remedy in practice 
is the claim for damages, which is common to the buyer (art. 45, para. 1 (b)) and 
the seller (art.  61, para.  1 (b)). The calculation of damages and the exemptions 
that may apply are governed by articles 74–77 and 79–80. The principle of full 
compensation applies, but it is limited to the losses that were foreseeable for the 
breaching party at the time of the conclusion of the contract (art. 74). In determining 
the damages, there is no need to prove the fault of the breaching party. Evidence 
of causality linking the breaching party’s conduct to the damages caused, which 
must also be proved, will suffice. 
274. 
While article 74 of the CISG states the general rule for the measurement 
of damages, articles 75 and 76 establish alternative methods to that end. Article 75 
regulates the operation of a substitute transaction. As a result of a breach of contract, 
the aggrieved seller may resell the goods or the aggrieved buyer may repurchase 
the goods in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time after avoidance 
and may recover the difference between the contract price and the price of the 
substitute transaction. Under article 76, damages are established in line with the 
current (or market) price for the goods in question. The current price must be estab-
lished at the time of avoidance (art. 76, para. 1) and correspond to the price prevailing 
at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made (art. 76, para. 2).
62 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
275. Article 77 of the CISG provides that a party who relies on a breach of contract 
must take measures to mitigate losses. Non-compliance with such obligation results 
in the non-performing party not being liable for any losses that the aggrieved party 
could have avoided.
276. 
Under the principle of freedom of contract (art. 6), the parties may derogate 
from articles 74–77 and provide for the payment of agreed sums for failure to per-
form the contract. The CISG itself contains no specific rules on agreed sums, but in 
the light of the general principles on which it is based (art. 7, para. 2), any rules on 
the protection of the obligor of the otherwise applicable law or rules of law relying 
on notions such as reasonableness, excessiveness or proportionality must be applied 
in accordance with an international standard. In this respect, article  7.4.13 of the 
UPICC and the Uniform Rules on Contract Clauses for an Agreed Sum Due upon 
Failure of Performance (1983)67 are based on such notions. Parties wishing to make 
specific provisions on this matter may wish to refer to them.
Are there situations in which the party in breach is 
exempted from damages?
277. 
The breaching party may be exempted from paying damages if the breach of 
contract was caused by an impediment beyond that party’s control (art.  79, 
para. 1).68 However, the CISG makes no provision for renegotiation or adaptation 
of a contract to restore its original equilibrium if it was fundamentally altered by an 
unanticipated supervening event that increases the cost of a party’s performance or 
diminishes the value of the performance a party receives (“hardship”). Some judicial 
decisions and doctrinal authorities refer to article  79 as a gateway to addressing 
such situations under the CISG. Articles 6.2.1 to 6.2.3 of the UPICC have detailed 
provisions that may be used to regulate the consequences of hardship in inter-
national contracts.69
278. 
According to the principle of freedom of contract (art. 6), the parties may 
derogate from the provisions of the Convention by directly excluding or limiting 
the breaching party’s liability in the event of non-performance or defective perfor-
mance (limitation and exclusion clauses). An express provision on exclusion or 
limitation of liability and its limits is contained in the UPICC (art. 7.1.6; see also 
para. 378 below).
67 Official Records of the General Assembly, Thirty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 17 (A/38/17), annex I; see also below, 
paras. 400–405. Additional information on the Uniform Rules is available on the UNCITRAL website.
68 The UPICC contain an analogous provision in article 7.1.7, which specifies the duties of information of the 
non-performing parties and the consequences of a breach of such duties. That article also expressly states that a 
party is not prevented from exercising a right to terminate the contract or to withhold performance or to request 
interest on money due.
69 On the hardship provisions of the UPICC, see paragraph 378 below.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
63
Are parties entitled to interest on sums which are not paid?
279. 
A claim for interest (art. 78) is available for any breach of contract by the 
buyer or the seller, whether it is fundamental or not. This provision sets forth an 
unambiguous entitlement to interest for the aggrieved party but does not determine 
the applicable interest rate. This was done in acknowledgement of the fact that inter-
est may violate mandatory provisions of domestic law in some jurisdictions. Most 
State courts applying article 78 determine the interest rate according to the domestic 
law applicable by reference to the conflict of laws rules of the forum State, though 
there are arbitral and judicial decisions that have referred to a uniform standard. For 
the drafting of contractual provisions on the applicable interest rate, parties may 
wish to consider the uniform rule provided in article 7.4.9 of the UPICC.70 
Anticipatory breach and instalment contracts
280. 
A number of remedies are available to either the buyer or the seller in the 
case of anticipatory breach by the other party. Article 71 of the CISG authorizes 
the aggrieved party to suspend the performance of obligations contained in single 
or instalment contracts if, after the conclusion of the contract, it has become appar-
ent that a substantial part of the obligations of the other party will not be performed 
by that party. Anticipated non-performance by the other party must result either 
from a serious deficiency in the ability to perform or in creditworthiness or from 
the conduct in preparing to perform or in performing the contract. 
281. 
In addition, the contract may be avoided if, prior to the date of perfor-
mance, it becomes clear that the buyer or the seller will commit a fundamental 
breach (art. 72). 
282. 
Finally, a contract for delivery of goods by instalments may be avoided if the 
failure of one party to perform any obligations in respect of any instalment constitutes 
a fundamental breach with respect to that instalment (art. 73, para. 1). The whole 
contract may be avoided if the breaching party gives the other party good grounds 
to conclude that a fundamental breach will occur with respect to future instalments.
Final clauses
283. 
As usual in treaties, part IV of the CISG contains its final clauses, namely, 
provisions that set forth how States may become a party to the treaty, or that allow 
a State to modify the scope of application of the treaty by lodging declarations. In 
70 See paras. 351–353 and 393 below. For an overview of the case law on the point, see UNCITRAL Digest of 
Case Law on the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, article 78.
64 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
line with a general obligation on States to periodically review treaty declarations, 
several declarations to the CISG have been withdrawn. At the same time, it is not 
unusual for new contracting States to lodge declarations.
What is the relationship between the CISG and other international 
agreements dealing with matters governed by the CISG?
284. 
According to article 90, the CISG does not prevail over other international 
agreements dealing with matters governed by the CISG if the parties to the contract 
have their places of business in States parties to such agreements. According to one 
view, “international agreements” do not include regional uniform law that needs 
to be transposed into national law, such as European Union directives. 
285. 
In general, the CISG and international agreements on PIL aspects of inter-
national sales contracts are mutually compatible (see paras. 27–30 above).
286. 
Article 99 requires the denunciation of the Convention relating to a Uni-
form Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and 
of the Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods 
before adoption of the CISG. The relevance of those two conventions is mostly 
historical.71 
B. Limitation Convention 
1. 
The purpose of the Limitation Convention
287. The Limitation Convention provides uniform international legal rules govern-
ing the limitation period in a contract for the international sale of goods. The limi-
tation period is defined as a period of time within which a party under a contract 
for the international sale of goods needs to commence legal proceedings, including 
judicial, arbitral and administrative proceedings, against the other party to assert a 
claim arising from the contract or relating to its breach, termination or invalidity 
(art. 1, para. 1). After the expiration of the limitation period, no such claim may 
be recognized or enforced in any legal proceedings. 
71 All States parties to the Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the Inter-
national Sale of Goods and the Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods, except 
the Gambia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, have denounced those conventions 
and adopted the CISG.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
65
288. 
Similar rules exist in most legal systems. However, a disparity exists not 
only regarding the length of the period and the rules governing the limitation of 
claims after the lapse of the period, but also regarding the conceptual basis of 
limitation periods. Some jurisdictions consider that claims are extinguished, as a 
matter of substantive law, as the result of expiration of the period (e.g., civil law 
rules on extinctive prescription periods). Other jurisdictions consider that the limi-
tation period is a procedural rule barring the bringing of claims to the courts (e.g., 
common law rules of statute of limitations). The Limitation Convention does not 
 attempt to solve this debate. Instead, it adopts a functional approach by listing the 
consequences of the expiration of the limitation periods. 
289. 
For international commercial contracts other than sale of goods, or if the 
parties have opted out of the Limitation Convention in a contract for the international 
sale of goods, pertinent rules on limitation periods can be found in chapter 10 of 
the UPICC. The following paragraphs include a brief comparison of the Limitation 
Convention and chapter 10 of the UPICC.
2. 
Scope of application of the Limitation Convention
290. 
The Limitation Convention applies to the same contract for the inter-
national sale of goods to which the CISG applies (compare articles 1, paragraph 1, 
3, 4 and 6, of the Limitation Convention with articles 1, 2 and 3 of the CISG).72
291. 
While the CISG does not deal with validity of the contract (art. 4, para. (a)), 
the Limitation Convention governs the limitation periods of claims resulting from 
the invalidity of contracts (art. 1, para. 1). They include claims for the restitution 
of goods delivered or payment made under a contract which subsequently turns 
out to be invalid because of, but not limited to, fraud (art. 10, para. 3). 
292. 
Even when the Limitation Convention is applicable to a contract, it does 
not govern the limitation period of certain claims arising from that contract 
(art.  5).73 The limitation period of those claims will be governed by the law 
 applicable according to PIL rules.
72 The Limitation Convention, adopted in 1974, predates the CISG, which was adopted in 1980. In order to 
harmonize the scope of application of the Limitation Convention with that of the CISG, the Protocol amending the 
Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods was adopted at the same diplomatic confer-
ence that adopted the CISG. Although there are minor differences in the language of the provisions, the rules are 
basically identical. The present Guide makes reference to the Limitation Convention as amended in 1980.
73 Those claims are: (a) claims based upon death of, or personal injury to, any person; (b) claims based upon 
nuclear damage caused by the goods sold; (c) claims based upon security interest in property; (d) claims based 
upon judgments or documents upon which enforcements can be obtained; and (e) claims based upon bills of 
exchange, cheque or promissory note (art. 5).

293. 
As is the case under the CISG, the parties may opt out of the Limitation 
Convention as a whole by agreement (art. 3, para. 2). If the parties have opted out 
of the Limitation Convention, the law applicable according to PIL rules governs 
the question of limitation period. It should be noted that the provisions of the 
Limitation Convention are mandatory except for modification of the length of the 
limitation period under article 22, paragraphs 2 and 3. Therefore, unlike article 6 
of the CISG, there is no provision in the Limitation Convention allowing the 
 parties to derogate from or vary the effects of its provisions.
3. 
Provisions on limitation periods
What is the length of the limitation period 
under the Limitation Convention?
294. 
The Limitation Convention adopts a dual limitation period. There is a gen-
eral limitation period of 4 years (art. 8), which can be extended or recommenced, 
and a maximum limitation period of 10 years (art. 23), which is a fixed period. 
295. 
With respect to the time when the limitation period commences to run, the 
basic rule is that it commences on the date on which the claim accrues (art.  9, 
para.  1), namely, the date the claim matures.74 This applies to both the general 
limitation period and the maximum limitation period.
296. 
The adoption of an objective time of commencement for both periods in the 
Limitation Convention is an approach different from the one adopted in recent 
domestic legislation and the UPICC. The latter texts also adopt a dual limitation 
period approach, but tend to choose a subjective time of commencement (e.g., the 
day the obligee knows or ought to know certain facts) for the shorter general period, 
and an objective time of commencement (e.g., the date the right can be exercised) 
for the longer maximum period (e.g., art. 10.2 of the UPICC). The approach of the 
Limitation Convention is due to the peculiarities of long-distance trade, and also to 
the fact that there is little need to protect a non-consumer seller or buyer by delaying 
commencement of the limitation period by adopting a subjective time of commence-
ment for the shorter period.
297. 
The UPICC adopt a shorter general limitation period of three years, beginning 
on the day after the day the obligee knows or ought to know the facts as a result 
of which the obligee’s right can be exercised (art. 10.2, para. 1). The length of the 
maximum limitation period under the UPICC is 10 years, which is the same as 
74 The Convention also provides special rules on the commencement of the period depending on the type of 
claim (arts. 10–12).
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
67
under the Limitation Convention. However, the day of commencement is slightly 
different: it is the day after the day the right can be exercised (art. 10.2, para. 2). 
298. 
The Limitation Convention has a detailed rule on how the limitation period 
is to be calculated (art. 28).
Can the length be modified by agreement of the parties?
299. 
The general limitation period cannot be modified by agreement of the 
 parties prior to its running, but it can be extended by a written declaration of the 
debtor during the running of the period (art. 22, paras. 1 and 2). In addition, the 
contract of sale may stipulate a shorter period for the commencement of arbitral 
proceedings, if the stipulation is valid under the law applicable to the contract 
(art. 22, para. 3). The maximum limitation period cannot be modified by agreement 
of the parties.
300. 
The UPICC are more lenient in terms of modification of the limitation 
period. The general limitation period can be shortened by the agreement of the 
parties, but not to less than one year. The UPICC also allow the maximum period 
to be modified by agreement of the parties, except that it cannot be shortened to 
less than 4 years or extended to more than 15 years (art. 10.3).
What happens if the limitation period expires?
301. 
The principal consequence of the expiration of the limitation period is that 
no claim will be recognized or enforced in legal proceedings commenced thereafter  
(art. 25, para. 1). The Limitation Convention is only concerned with the recogni-
tion or enforcement of claims in any legal proceedings and is not concerned with 
whether the right is extinguished or not. The UPICC, on the other hand, expressly 
provide that the expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the right 
(art. 10.9, para. 1).
302. 
However, according to the Limitation Convention, even after the limitation 
period has expired, a party can, in certain situations, raise a claim as a defence to 
or set off against a claim asserted by the other party (art.  25, para.  2; see also 
art. 10.9, para. 3, of the UPICC). 
Will the court consider the limitation period on its own initiative?
303. 
Article 24 of the Limitation Convention provides that the expiration of the 
limitation period will not be taken into consideration in legal proceedings unless 
it is invoked by a party to the proceedings (see also art. 10.9, para. 2, of the UPICC). 
68 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
How can the creditor stop the running of the limitation period?
304. 
Limitation periods cease to run when the claimant commences judicial or 
arbitral proceedings against the debtor, or when a claim is asserted by the claimant 
in existing court proceedings (arts. 13 and 14 of the Limitation Convention; see 
also arts. 10.5 and 10.7 of the UPICC).75 Procedures for commencement of judicial 
proceedings depend on national laws and, therefore, the Limitation Convention 
indicates that “any act which, under the law of the court where the proceedings are 
instituted, is recognized as commencing judicial proceedings” constitutes the com-
mencement of judicial proceedings. Arbitral proceedings are commenced accord ing 
to the manner provided for in the arbitration agreement or by the  applicable arbi-
tration law, for example, with the receipt of the request for arbitration and of any 
other required information by the secretariat of an arbitral institution. In the  absence 
of such a provision, arbitration proceedings are deemed to commence on the date 
that the request for arbitration is delivered to the respondent (see also art. 3, para. 2, 
of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules).
305. 
By cessation, limitation periods are not suspended (see, however, para. 308 
below), nor do they recommence anew (see, however, paras. 310 and 311 below). 
They simply cease to run; in other words, they do not run anymore. 
306. 
The UPICC adopt a different approach by providing that the running of 
the limitation period is suspended when the obligee asserts rights in judicial pro-
ceedings or arbitration proceedings, such as by commencing the proceedings, or 
in insolvency proceedings or dissolution proceedings (arts. 10.5, para. 1, and 10.6, 
para.  1). The suspension lasts until a final decision has been issued or until the 
proceedings have been otherwise terminated (arts. 10.5, para. 2, and 10.6, para. 2). 
The UPICC also extend these rules to proceedings of alternative dispute resolution, 
such as mediation, whereby the parties request a third person to assist them in 
their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute (art. 10.7).
What happens if proceedings do not result in a decision  
on the merits of the claim?
307. 
Judicial or arbitral proceedings commenced by a claimant within the limita-
tion period might terminate without a binding decision on the merits of the claim, 
for example, because the court or arbitral tribunal lacks jurisdiction or because of 
75 The Limitation Convention provides a special rule that prevents limitation periods for counterclaims from expiring 
(art. 16). It also contains a special rule to resolve questions concerning the running of limitation periods when there 
are jointly and severally liable debtors and when the buyer brings a recourse claim against the seller if a proceeding 
has been commenced against the buyer by a party that purchased the goods from the buyer (art. 18).
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
69
a procedural defect. For such case, the Limitation Convention provides that if the 
original proceedings end without a binding decision on the merits, the limitation 
period will be deemed to have continued to run (art. 17, para. 1). 
308. 
In that situation, most legal systems allow the creditor to pursue the claim 
by commencing new proceedings. However, by the time the original proceedings 
have ended, the limitation period might have expired, or there might remain 
insuffi cient time for the claimant to commence new proceedings. To protect the 
claimant in those cases, the Convention grants an additional period of one year 
to commence new proceedings (art. 17, para. 2). However, this is subject to the 
maximum limitation period of 10 years (art. 23).
309. 
The UPICC adopt a different approach by providing that suspension of the 
limitation period lasts not only until a binding decision has been issued, but also 
until the proceedings have been terminated without reaching a final decision 
(arts. 10.5, para. 2, and 10.6, para. 2). Therefore, there is no provision under the 
UPICC that corresponds to article 17, paragraph 2, of the Limitation Convention. 
Does the obligor’s performance or acknowledgement have any effect 
on the running of the limitation period?
310. 
Under the Limitation Convention, the limitation period recommences (i.e., 
the four-year period runs anew) within the total limit of 10 years from the date 
the claim accrued, in two situations. In the first situation, the limitation period 
recommences if the creditor performs in the debtor’s State an act, including an act 
that can be made outside legal proceedings, that, under the law of that State, has 
the effect of recommencing a limitation period (art. 19).
311. 
In the second situation, the limitation period recommences if the debtor 
acknowledges the obligation to the creditor in writing (art.  20, para.  1) or pays 
interest or partially performs the obligation from which such acknowledgement 
can be inferred (art. 20, para. 2). The rule is similar but different under the UPICC. 
Under the UPICC, there is no requirement for written acknowledgement (see 
art. 10.4, para. 1). Another difference is that, unlike under the Limitation Conven-
tion, the maximum period does not recommence, but may be exceeded by the 
beginning of a new general limitation period (art. 10.4, para. 2).
What happens if the creditor is prevented from instituting 
legal proceedings?
312. 
The Limitation Convention protects a creditor who was prevented from 
taking the necessary acts to stop the running of the limitation period in extreme 
cases such as commercial dispute resolution in countries that have been affected 
70 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
by military conflict. It provides that, when the creditor could not take those acts 
as a result of a circumstance beyond the control of the creditor and which could 
be neither avoided nor overcome, the limitation period will be extended so as to 
expire one year after the date when the circumstance ceased to exist (art.  21). 
However, this extension is subject to the maximum limitation period of 10 years 
(art. 23). The UPICC adopt the same rule (art. 10.8, para. 1), but extend it to a 
situation where the impediment consists of the incapacity or death of the  obligor 
or the obligee and where a representative of the party’s estate has not been 
 appointed or a successor has not inherited the respective party’s position 
(art. 10.8, para. 2).
How can the creditor make sure that cessation in one State  
has international effect?
313. 
As noted above, the limitation period ceases to run when legal proceedings 
are instituted (arts. 13–18 of the Limitation Convention). The Limitation Conven-
tion provides that such an act in one contracting State also has effect in other 
contracting States, provided that the creditor has taken reasonable steps to inform 
the debtor (art. 30). Thus, the creditor does not have to worry about instituting 
court proceedings in all relevant States to cease the running of the limitation period. 
This rule also applies to the extension of limitation periods under article 17 and 
the recommencement of the limitation period under article 19.
314. 
Under the Convention, cessation by performance or acknowledgement by 
the debtor (arts. 19 and 20) and extension by prevention (art.  21) are acts or 
circumstances not connected to a particular State, and have international effect by 
their nature.
4. 
Interaction with other uniform law instruments
Relationship with the CISG
General relationship
315. 
The Limitation Convention and the CISG may be considered sister conven-
tions. Although the CISG governs the rights and obligations of the seller and buyer 
arising from contracts for the international sale of goods, it does not contain rules 
on limitation periods. The Limitation Convention fills that lacuna. Although they 
can be applied independently from each other, the most value will be derived if 
both are applied to a contract. Thus, it is recommended that States become parties 
to both Conventions.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
71
316. 
In 1980, the scope of application of the Limitation Convention was 
 amended to align it with that of the CISG (see para. 290 above). Thus, except for 
a few situations, the CISG and the Limitation Convention apply to the same con-
tract and claims arising therefrom. 
Relationship with time limits under the CISG 
317. 
The CISG contains several provisions that relate to time limits. For example, 
article 39, paragraph 2, provides that the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of 
conformity of the goods unless notice is given to the seller of the non-conformity 
within two years from the date the goods are handed over to the buyer (see 
para. 207 above). Such time limits are not to be confused with the limitation period 
under the Limitation Convention. The Limitation Convention expressly provides 
that it does not affect a particular time limit within which one party is required, 
as a condition for the acquisition or exercise of the claim, to give notice to the 
other party or perform any act other than the institution of legal proceedings 
(art. 1, para. 2; see also art. 10.1, para. 2, of the UPICC).
Relationship with the UPICC
318. 
The parties need to opt out of the Limitation Convention (see para.  293 
above) in order to choose the UPICC as the law applicable to limitation periods, 
provided that PIL rules allow such choice.
Relationship with the Electronic Communications Convention
319. 
The Limitation Convention contains the requirements for acknowledge-
ment in writing by the debtor without expressly providing that the written declara-
tion can be made electronically. In this regard, the Electronic Communications 
Convention provides conditions under which such requirements can be met by 
electronic communications in connection with a contract to which the Limitation 
Convention applies (arts. 9, para. 2, and 20, para. 1).
Relationship with PIL
320. 
The Limitation Convention does not exclude the application of PIL. There 
will always be a law made applicable by the PIL rules, but for the matter of limita-
tion periods, the Limitation Convention prevails. This is the case even if the law 
of the forum considers limitation periods as a procedural matter. 
321. 
 If the parties opt out of the Limitation Convention in accordance with its  
article 3, paragraph 2, the otherwise applicable law will apply. This includes domestic 
laws as well as the UPICC, as far as the PIL rules allow such choice by the parties.

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
C. Unidroit Principles of International 
Commercial  Contracts 
1. 
What are the purposes of the UPICC? 
322. 
The UPICC are a non-binding codification of contract law rules and prin-
ciples designed for international trade on a global scale. Their objective is to make 
available a set of rules that is better suited to cross-border transactions than national 
contract laws. Three features of the UPICC serve this purpose.
323. 
First, the UPICC provide a “neutral” law for international transactions; in 
other words, a set of rules that is not the national contract law of either of the 
parties. They achieve this by setting forth rules that do not specifically resemble 
any particular national contract law and that reflect a compromise between the 
common law and the civil law traditions. 
324. 
Second, the UPICC stipulate rules that are better suited to the special 
require ments of international trade than national contract law regimes, which are 
primarily designed to deal with national transactions. 
325. 
Third, the UPICC are multilingual. They are available in a variety of world 
languages, so that it is very likely that both parties to an international contract can 
access them in a language that they are familiar with. 
2. 
How were the UPICC developed?
326. 
The UPICC were developed by international working groups that consisted 
of eminent contract lawyers, acting in their personal capacity, under the auspices 
of Unidroit. The publication of the UPICC was first authorized by the Governing 
Council of Unidroit in 1994.
327. The drafting of the UPICC was preceded by detailed comparative examina-
tions of existing contract law. The working groups drew upon a variety of national 
contract laws and international contract law instruments as sources of inspiration. 
328. 
The working groups consulted a range of national contract laws from the 
civil-law and common-law traditions, in particular, the main European civil codes, 
English common law and American contract law as set out in the Restatement 
(Second) of Contracts and the United States Uniform Commercial Code.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
73
329. 
A number of international conventions were particularly influential in the 
work of the working groups. These included, in addition to the CISG and the Limi-
tation Convention, the Convention on Agency in the International Sale of Goods,76 
the Convention on International Factoring (1988)77 and the United Nations Con-
vention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade (2001).78 The 
drafters also took into account soft-law instruments issued by other international 
institutions, such as the Incoterms (see paras. 143–147 above) and the UCP (see 
para. 243 above). Moreover, they drew inspiration from model contracts of organi-
zations such as the ICC and the International Federation of Consulting Engineers 
(FIDIC). 
330. 
As a result of this comparative exercise, the UPICC contain two types of 
provisions. Some of the articles represent what is often referred to as an “international 
restatement of general principles of contract law”. In these instances, the drafters 
were able to identify a solution to a particular problem that was shared across 
domestic and international contract laws, and they restated the rule in one of the 
articles of the instrument. However, that was frequently not possible because no 
global “common core” of solutions could be established. In that case, the drafters 
either chose from existing approaches or designed new rules in order to adopt what 
they perceived to be the best solutions, particularly with a view to the special require-
ments of international trade. They aimed to strike a balance between the common-
law and the civil-law traditions. For those reasons, the UPICC are widely regarded 
as providing jurisdictionally “neutral” solutions.
3. 
Editions and language versions
331. 
The UPICC are currently in their fourth edition (2016), with the second 
and third editions dating from 2004 and 2010, respectively. New provisions on 
further issues of contract law were added to each edition and thus the coverage of 
the UPICC was broadened. The instrument is available in all five of the official 
languages of Unidroit (English, French, German, Italian and Spanish). In addition 
to those official versions, there are numerous translations into other languages. All 
editions and language versions are easily accessible online.79

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
4. 
What is the meaning of “principles” of contract law?
332. 
Despite the reference to “principles” in their title, the UPICC are not con-
fined to spelling out broad and general standards, or principes directeurs, such as 
“good faith and fair dealing”. The majority of the 211 articles are straightforward, 
hard-and-fast “rules” which can be applied in the same way as any other national 
or transnational rule of contract law. They more or less predetermine the solution 
in a given case in a predictable fashion. In this regard, the UPICC very much resem-
ble a codification of general contract law as can be found in national civil codes or 
contract law acts or in transnational commercial law instruments, such as the CISG. 
5. 
What are the basic differences as compared to the CISG 
and what is their nature?
333. 
The UPICC differ from the CISG in three major ways. First, their status is 
not that of a treaty. They are a non-binding set of rules that will only apply to a 
given contract if the parties or an adjudicator so chooses and if such a choice is 
recognized or acknowledged by the relevant legal framework (see paras.  40–66 
above and paras. 337–350 below). Second, the scope of application of the UPICC 
is not confined to contracts of sale. The UPICC spell out general rules of contract 
law that may be used for all types of contracts, including service contracts (see 
paras. 354–357 below). Third, they contain a vast array of rules pertaining to the 
general law of contract and obligations, and thus on issues not covered by the CISG 
(see below, in particular, para. 396).
334. 
Similarly to the CISG and the Limitation Convention, the UPICC were 
designed and drafted under the auspices of an international organization. However, 
unlike those and other conventions in the area of transnational commercial law, 
they are a so-called “soft-law” instrument; therefore, they do not impose an obligation 
on States to bring the rules of the instrument into force by way of national legislation, 
constitutional arrangements or other mechanisms of transposition. 
335. 
National legislators may enact the UPICC either in their entirety or selec-
tively as domestic rules of contract law, as they may do with other uniform law 
instruments. In fact, one of the purposes of the UPICC, as expressly listed in the 
preamble thereto, is to “serve as a model for national and international legislators”. 
There are many examples of national legislators which have chosen to do so.80 
80 Among others, the 1999 Contract Law of China, many post-Socialist civil codes in Eastern and Central-
Eastern Europe, the 2015 Civil and Commercial Code of Argentina and the 2016 revised Civil Code of France 
contain many provisions modelled on the UPICC. The Scottish Law Commission routinely refers to the UPICC 
as a source of inspiration for its legislative proposals in the area of contract law. An even more comprehensive 
introduction has been discussed in Australia and Spain, and also by the Organization for the Harmonization of 
Business Law in Africa (OHADA), an intergovernmental organization with 17 States members.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
75
336. 
As long as they have not been implemented in this way, the UPICC, as such, 
do not impose direct obligations on contracting parties. They do not automatically 
apply once a contract is within their scope of application (see paras. 354–357 below), 
as would be the case with a binding instrument, such as the CISG or the Limita-
tion Convention. The UPICC can only bind the parties if two additional require-
ments have been met: first, the parties, or someone adjudicating a dispute between 
them, must have chosen to make the UPICC applicable in their contractual relation-
ship (see paras. 337–342 below); and, second, such a choice must be respected by 
the law governing the proceedings between the parties, be it the lex fori or the lex 
arbitri (see paras. 343–350 below). However, even if these requirements have not 
been met, the UPICC may indirectly apply to the contractual relationship between 
the parties if the adjudicator uses them to interpret or supplement the applicable 
contract law (see paras. 351–353 below). 
6. 
How can the UPICC be used in practice?
337. 
There are various ways in which the UPICC can be made to apply in a given 
contractual relationship. 
338. 
First, the parties themselves may designate the UPICC as the law governing 
their contract. Such a choice can be made by express agreement of the parties, 
either at the time of making the contract or at a later stage (see chap. III, sect. B, 
above). Since the coverage of the UPICC is limited to general issues of contract 
law, the parties may wish to supplement the choice with their choice of a domestic 
law. The rules of that law will then serve as a default law for issues outside the 
scope of application of the UPICC. In the absence of such choice, PIL rules will 
determine the domestic law applicable to those issues.
339. 
In order to assist parties in drafting pertinent choice of law clauses, 
 Unidroit published the Model Clauses for the Use of the Unidroit Principles 
of International Commercial Contracts in 2013 (see paras. 65–66 above). Further 
model clauses of a similar nature are contained in model contracts of other inter-
national organizations, such as the 2000 ICC Model International Franchising 
Contract, the 2002 ICC Model Commercial Agency Contract and the Model 
 Contracts for Small Firms prepared by the International Trade Centre.81
340. 
Second, even if the parties choose to have their contract governed by a law 
other than the UPICC or do not designate any governing law at all, they may still 
incorporate the UPICC as terms of the contract, as they may do with any other 
set of rules (see para. 25 above). They may incorporate the UPICC in their entirety, 
81 The Model Contracts for Small Firms are available on the International Trade Centre website. 
76 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
or they may incorporate individual provisions or selected parts only, for example, 
chapter 4, setting forth the rules on contractual interpretation, or chapter 6, section 2, 
containing provisions on hardship. 
341. 
Insofar as a given rule of the UPICC has been incorporated as a term of 
the contract, the contractual relationship between the parties will be governed by 
that rule. However, as a term of the contract, the rule can bind the parties only to 
the extent that it does not violate the mandatory provisions of the law governing 
the contract; in other words, those rules from which the parties to a contract may 
not derogate by way of agreement. Comparative studies have shown that such con-
flicts arise rarely and, even if they do, article 1.4 of the UPICC expressly acknowl-
edges the prevalence of mandatory rules (see para. 102 above).
342. 
Third, a court or an arbitral tribunal may designate the UPICC as the law 
governing a particular contract. There are two scenarios in which adjudicators may 
find this attractive: (a) the parties have not chosen any law at all to govern their 
contract; and (b) the parties have agreed that their contract should be governed 
by some unwritten transnational body of rules, such as the “general principles of 
law”, “the lex mercatoria” or “usages and customs of international trade”. In the 
former scenario, the UPICC will normally offer a more neutral solution than the 
domestic contract law of a given State; they also tend to be better adapted to the 
needs of international trade than national contract law rules that are not particularly 
concerned with the specific problems arising in cross-border contracting. In the 
latter scenario, the UPICC are generally considered the best available and most 
accessible manifestation of the unwritten rules of international commerce. 
7. 
How would judges and arbitrators apply a clause 
designating the UPICC as the applicable law of the contract? 
343. 
A choice by the parties to designate the UPICC as the law governing their 
contract will not always be acknowledged by the relevant legal framework. Nor 
will it always be possible for adjudicators to make such choices. The reason for this 
is that party autonomy with regard to the choice of non-State law has traditionally 
been limited and continues to be so in important aspects (see paras. 44–47. above).
Judicial setting
344. 
The possibility of choosing non-State law is particularly limited in litigation 
before State courts. Some courts may not acknowledge a choice of the UPICC as 
the law governing the contract made by the parties, and they are not themselves 
free to designate the UPICC as the applicable law. This is because they are subject 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
77
to the PIL rules of their forum. Most of these rules limit party autonomy to the choice 
of a particular State law and thus exclude choices of transnational non-State law instru-
ments such as the UPICC. A major regional instrument following this traditional 
approach is the Rome I Regulation (art. 3, para. 1; see also paras. 55–56 above). 
345. 
The domestic PIL rules of Paraguay and Uruguay are a notable exception 
to the traditional approach (see para. 47 above). If legislators in other States were 
to follow this example, the courts of those States would also have to acknowledge 
the choice of the UPICC by the parties.
346. 
It has also been argued that, under article  9, paragraph  2, of the Mexico 
Convention, State courts should take the UPICC into account as “general princi-
ples of international commercial law” if the parties have not chosen a law applicable 
to the contract.82 However, the Mexico Convention has not yet secured a large 
number of accessions and ratifications. 
347. 
Even when a traditional choice of law regime applies, a State court does not 
have to entirely ignore the fact that the parties intended to choose the UPICC. In 
order to give effect, as much as possible, to the intention of the parties, such a 
court should interpret the intention to choose the law governing the contract as 
an agreement to incorporate the UPICC as terms of the contract (see paras. 340–
342 above). In the European Union, for example, this possibility is specifically 
mentioned in recital 13 of the Rome I Regulation. 
Arbitral setting
348. 
As opposed to State courts, arbitral tribunals normally acknowledge the 
parties’ choice of non-State law, such as the UPICC. The reason for this is that the 
rules of arbitration of most arbitral institutions provide that the parties are free to 
agree upon the “rules of law” to be applied by the tribunal (e.g., ICC Rules, art. 21, 
para. 1). This notion includes non-State law, such as the UPICC. In ad hoc arbitrations 
subject to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the tribunal is also bound to accept 
a choice of rules of law (art. 35, para. 1). Moreover, most domestic laws on arbitration 
respect the freedom of the parties to choose non-State law in arbitral proceedings. This 
is particularly so in those States that have adopted article 28, paragraph 1, of the 
UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. 
349. 
Parties wishing to have their contract governed by the UPICC are therefore 
well advised to combine a choice of law clause in favour of the UPICC (see 
paras. 65–66 above) with an arbitration agreement. At least one arbitral institution 
82 See, for example, the Guide on the Law Applicable to International Commercial Contracts in the Americas, 
paras. 185–187 and 352–354.
78 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
explicitly suggests the choice of the UPICC to parties that agree to have their 
dispute arbitrated by the institution.83 
350. 
Finally, under the arbitration regimes mentioned in paragraph 348 above, 
arbitral tribunals are often free to apply the UPICC if the parties have expressly 
authorized the tribunal to decide ex aequo et bono or as amiable compositeur (e.g., 
UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, art. 28, para. 3; 
and ICC Rules, art. 21, para. 3), or have not made any stipulation with regard to 
the law governing the merits of the dispute (e.g., ICC Rules, art. 21, para. 1). In 
those cases, many of the relevant arbitration rules and laws tend to afford the tri-
bunal broad discretion to apply the rules of law which it determines to be appro-
priate (e.g., French Code of Civil Procedure, art. 1511, para. 1). Under article 56 
of the 2013 Panama Arbitration Law, tribunals in international arbitration are even 
under a duty to take the UPICC, among other sources of law, into account.
8. 
Indirect application as a means of interpretation and 
supplementation
351. 
Even in scenarios in which neither the parties nor the adjudicator have des-
ignated the UPICC as the law governing the contract or in which such a designa-
tion took place but is not acknowledged by the relevant legal framework, the 
UPICC may affect the contractual relationship of the parties. This happens when 
State courts or arbitral tribunals use the UPICC as a means of interpreting and 
supplementing the otherwise applicable contract law.
352. 
Adjudicators may use the UPICC to determine the meaning of rules and 
concepts of national contract laws and international uniform law instruments, in-
cluding the CISG. Whether an adjudicator may take the UPICC into account for 
the purposes of interpretation of another contract law regime depends on the rules 
and principles of interpretation of that particular regime. Recourse to the UPICC 
in interpreting the CISG, for example, is generally accepted because article 7, para-
graph 1, of the CISG stipulates that, in its interpretation, “regard is to be had to 
its international character”. 
353. 
Adjudicators may also have recourse to the UPICC to fill gaps in national and 
international contract law regimes. In both the national and the international con-
texts, the permissibility of gap-filling with reference to the UPICC depends on the 
relevant rules and principles on the methodology and the limits of gap-filling. In the 
CISG, for example, the relevant rule is article 7, paragraph 2 (see paras. 127–132 above). 
83 Article 35, paragraph 1 (c), of the Arbitration Rules of the Chinese-European Arbitration Centre.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
79
It stipulates that questions concerning matters governed by the Convention which 
are not expressly settled in it “are to be settled in conformity with the general prin-
ciples on which it is based”. The general principles to which article 7, paragraph 2, 
refers are overarching rules that permeate the entire Convention, or at least a signifi-
cant number of its provisions. They are arguably not numerous, and the more detailed 
UPICC do represent a compilation of such general principles. Nevertheless, both the 
CISG and the UPICC draw largely on the same sources, and at least some of the 
rules contained in the UPICC are restatements of general principles of international 
commercial law on which, among others, the CISG is based. UNCITRAL has for-
mally commended the use of the UPICC for their intended purposes84 and these 
purposes, as set out in the preamble to the UPICC, include the use of the UPICC 
to “supplement international uniform law instruments”.
9. 
What is the scope of application of the UPICC?
354. 
According to the first paragraph  of their preamble, the UPICC “set forth 
general rules for international commercial contracts”. 
355. 
The scope of the instrument is not narrowly confined. The notions of both 
international and commercial contracts are to be understood broadly. They poten-
tially include all cross-border transactions in which neither of the parties acts as a 
consumer. In this regard, their scope of application resembles that of the CISG and 
the Limitation Convention (see paras. 106–109 and 290–293 above).
356. 
As opposed to those conventions, however, the scope of application of the 
UPICC is not confined to contracts for the sale of goods. The UPICC set forth 
“general rules” of contract law. As such, they are not specifically concerned with 
the rules pertaining to any particular type of contract. Rather, they contain provi-
sions on general matters of contract law that occur in all types of contract, such as 
formation, interpretation, validity and the remedies for non-performance. As a 
result, the UPICC apply to all types of international commercial contracts, includ-
ing but not limited to the sale of goods. Most importantly, service contracts are 
also within their scope of application. 
357. 
Issues may arise with regard to the intertemporal scope of application of 
the various editions of the UPICC. There are four different editions of the instru-
ment, dating from 1994, 2004, 2010 and 2016, with each of them increasing the 
coverage of the instrument (see para. 331 above). Unless the parties have agreed 
otherwise, adjudicators will normally apply the most recent version.

Substantive provisions: general overview
358. 
The coverage of the UPICC extends to all important issues of general con-
tract law that may arise in international commercial contracts. The relevant rules 
and principles are set forth in 211 separate articles, the so-called “black-letter rules”. 
359. 
Each black-letter rule is followed by an additional comment, often includ-
ing one or more hypothetical case applications (“illustrations”). According to 
 Unidroit, these comments are an integral part of the UPICC, to the extent that 
the black-letter rules and the comments, taken together, constitute the “integral 
version” of the instrument.85 This is particularly important because some of the 
comments go beyond mere explanation of the articles. In effect, they propose 
 additional rules or advocate a narrower reading of certain rules than the text of 
the relevant articles would seem to indicate.
360. 
The first edition of the UPICC, published in 1994, set forth 120 articles. 
Each of the topics covered was the subject of a separate chapter of the instrument. 
These ranged from formation (chap. 2) to validity, especially problems arising from 
defects of consent (chap. 3), interpretation (chap. 4), content of contracts (chap. 5), 
performance of contracts (chap. 6) and remedies for non-performance (chap. 7). 
Chapter  1 sets forth definitions and general principles that apply across all the 
issues covered. It is on those topics, particularly with regard to formation and remedies 
for non-performance, that there is a substantial thematic overlap with the CISG 
(see para. 394 below).
361. 
In the 2004 edition, 65 new articles were added, dealing with six further 
thematic areas: agency (chap. 2, sect. 2), contracts for the benefit of third parties 
(chap. 5, sect. 2), set-off (chap. 8), assignment of rights, transfer of obligations and 
assignment of contracts (chap.  9) and limitation periods (chap.  10). The latter 
broadly covers the same ground as the Limitation Convention (see para. 395 below 
and chap. IV, sect. B, above). 
362. The 2010 edition contained 26 new provisions, on illegality (chap. 3, sect. 3), 
conditions (chap. 5, sect. 3), the plurality of obligors and obligees (chap. 11) and 
restitution with respect to contracts to be performed over a period of time (art. 7.3.7), 
as well as a few other changes that were necessitated by those additions.
363. 
With each new edition, the portions of the text carried over from the more 
recent edition remained largely unchanged, with revisions confined mainly to some 
minor amendments and additions, and most of these being restricted to the 
comments. 
85 The integral versions in English and French are available on the Unidroit website.
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
81
364. 
A different approach was taken with the 2016 edition. The main objective 
was to better address the special requirements of long-term contracts. In order to 
do so, no new provisions were added; instead, six existing articles and many of the 
existing comments were substantially amended. 
365. 
At present, therefore, the UPICC set forth 211 articles that are divided the-
matically into 11 chapters, with some of these being divided into sections. 
366. 
The articles are preceded by a preamble listing the purposes of the instru-
ment. These include the application of the UPICC as the law governing the con-
tract because of a corresponding choice or decision by an adjudicator and their 
use as a means of interpreting and supplementing national law and international 
uniform law instruments as such. As has been seen, the extent to which these 
purposes will materialize will depend on the relevant lex fori or lex arbitri and on 
the applicable rules and principles on interpretation and gap-filling.
367. 
Chapter 1 contains a number of general provisions that are meant to inform 
the interpretation and application of the entire instrument. Apart from a general 
rule on the approach to be followed in the interpretation and supplementation of 
the UPICC (art. 1.6), these include a handful of overarching general principles of 
contract law, namely, freedom of contract (art.  1.1), freedom of form (art.  1.2), 
binding nature of the contract (art. 1.3) and good faith and fair dealing (art. 1.7). 
The chapter also includes statutory definitions of key terms (arts. 1.10 and 1.11) 
and a specific article on the priority of applicable mandatory rules (art. 1.4) (see 
paras. 102–103 above and para. 389 below).
368. 
Chapter 2, section 1, deals with the formation of contracts, with detailed 
rules on offer and acceptance that cover, among others, the withdrawal, revocation 
and rejection of offers (arts. 2.1.3–5), cases of modified acceptance (art. 2.1.11) 
and contracts with open terms (art.  2.1.14). Four provisions are devoted to the 
incorporation of standard terms (arts. 2.1.19–22). There are also rules covering 
bad faith and breaches of confidentiality during the negotiations that lead up to 
the conclusion of the contract (arts. 2.1.15–16). While the rules on offer and accept-
ance were modelled on, and are broadly in line with, the CISG, the others contain 
significant further details and cover additional topics (see chap. IV, sect. A, above).
369. 
Chapter 2, section 2, sets forth rules on agency in the context of contract 
formation (for further information on agency, see chap. V, sect. C, below). It deals 
with the circumstances in which an agent affects the contractual relations between 
the principal and the third party. The section also provides remedies for the third 
party against the agent if the latter purports to bind the principal and fails to do 
so. The section therefore governs the express, implied and apparent granting of 
authority to the agent (arts. 2.2.2 and 2.2.5) and a potential sub-agent (art. 2.2.8), 
82 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
as well as the termination of authority (art.  2.2.10). An agent acting without 
 authority may be liable for damages (art.  2.2.6), unless the principal ratifies the 
unauthorized act (art. 2.2.9). The principal may avoid the contract if the agent was 
involved in a conflict of interests (art. 2.2.7). The section is limited to the external 
aspects of agency, namely, the relations between the principal or the agent on the 
one hand, and the third party on the other; it does not cover questions arising 
from the internal relationship between the principal and the agent (art. 2.2.1).
370. 
Chapter 3 covers the validity of contracts, with a few introductory provisions 
in chapter 3, section 1. These clarify that the chapter does not cover questions of 
capacity (art. 3.1.1) and that its rules are mandatory (art. 3.1.4) (see para. 389 below).
371. 
Chapter 3, section 2, lists the relevant grounds for the avoidance of a con-
tract. These are mistake (arts. 3.2.1–4), fraud (art.  3.2.5), threat (art.  3.2.6) and 
gross disparity (art. 3.2.7). In all these cases, the innocent party has the right to 
bring the contract to an end with retroactive effect and may claim damages and 
restitution where appropriate (arts. 3.2.10–17). 
372. Chapter 3, section 3, deals with illegal contracts, namely, contracts infringing 
a mandatory rule, whether of national, international or supranational origin. The effects 
of the infringement are those expressly prescribed by the relevant mandatory rule or, 
in the absence of an express prescription, the remedies that are reasonable in the cir-
cumstances of the case (art. 3.3.1). If appropriate, restitution may be granted (art. 3.3.2). 
373. 
Chapter 4 sets out a detailed set of rules for the interpretation of contracts 
and contractual statements. A contract has to be interpreted according to the mean-
ing that reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties would give to it, unless 
a different common intention of the parties can be established (art. 4.1). In doing 
so, the adjudicator must have regard to all relevant circumstances, including the 
negotiations preceding the contract and the subsequent conduct of the parties 
(art. 4.3). Contracts must be interpreted as a whole (art. 4.4), in a way that all terms 
are given effect (art. 4.5) and, in the event of an unclear term, against the party that 
supplied the term (art.  4.6). There are specific rules on linguistic discrepancies 
 between different language versions of a contract (art. 4.7) and gap-filling (art. 4.8).
374. 
Chapter 5, section 1, contains a number of rules pertaining to the content 
of contracts, once concluded. The obligations of the parties may be implied 
(art. 5.1.2), and they include a general duty of cooperation (art. 5.1.3). Criteria for 
the distinction between duties to achieve a result and duties of best efforts are 
introduced (arts. 5.1.4–5). There are rules on the quality and the price of perfor-
mance and the possibility of terminating contracts concluded for an indefinite 
period of time for cases where those issues have not been expressly agreed by the 
parties (arts. 5.1.6–8).
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
83
375. 
Chapter 5, section 2, lays out a comprehensive regime for contracts in favour 
of third parties, namely, the conferral of an enforceable contractual right on a “bene-
ficiary” by way of agreement between the original parties (the “promisee” and the 
“promisor”) (art. 5.2.1). Rules fleshing out the intricate tripartite relationship arising 
from such contracts include those on potential defences of the promisor, the entitle-
ment of the original parties to revoke the conferral of the right and the right of the 
beneficiary to renounce the right conferred (arts. 5.2.4–6). 
376. Chapter 5, section 3, deals with contractual conditions. It distinguishes suspen-
sive and resolutive conditions and their respective effects (arts. 5.3.1–2 and 5.3.5). 
Parties may not interfere with conditions in bad faith and are under a good faith duty 
to preserve the other party’s rights while a condition is pending (arts. 5.3.3–4). 
377. Chapter 6, section 1, contains default rules on how performance is to be ren-
dered with regard to the time and place of performance (arts. 6.1.1 and 6.1.6), the 
right to reject partial or earlier performance (arts. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5), payment modalities 
(arts. 6.1.7–12) and the effects of public permission requirements (arts. 6.1.14–17).
378. 
Chapter 6, section 2, deals with the effects of hardship, namely, supervening 
events that fundamentally alter the equilibrium of the contract (art. 6.2.2). It is clear 
from article 6.2.1 that, where the performance of a contract becomes more onerous 
for one of the parties, that party is nevertheless bound to perform its obligations, 
unless the exceptional circumstance of hardship may be invoked. As a result of a 
hardship situation, the aggrieved party has a right to renegotiate the contract condi-
tions so as to restore its equilibrium. If the renegotiations are unsuccessful, the 
court or tribunal, should it decide to take action, may terminate the contract or 
adapt it with a view to restoring its equilibrium (art. 6.2.3). 
379. 
Chapter  7 sets forth the remedies for non-performance, once again with 
substantial overlap with the rules in the CISG (see para.  394 below). To begin 
with, there are a number of general provisions on non-performance in chapter 7, 
section 1. These include the non-performing party’s right to cure (art. 7.1.4), the 
aggrieved party’s right to withhold performance (art. 7.1.3), the possibility for the 
aggrieved party to set an additional time for performance at the end of which, if 
the other party has not yet performed, the aggrieved party may exercise all available 
remedies (art. 7.1.5, the Nachfrist mechanism), the policing of exemption clauses 
(art. 7.1.6) and the exemption from liability for damages in cases of force majeure 
(art. 7.1.7). 
380. Chapter 7, section 2, deals with specific performance that is generally available, 
albeit with a number of important restrictions in the case of non-monetary obliga-
tions (art. 7.2.2). Court orders for performance are strengthened by the possibility 
of imposing additional judicial penalties (art. 7.2.4). 
84 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
381. 
Chapter 7, section 3, lays out the rules on termination of contracts. This is 
only available if non-performance can be qualified as “fundamental” (art. 7.3.1), 
when an additional period for performance of reasonable length was set and the 
other party has not performed within that period (art.  7.3.1, para.  3) or when 
fundamental non-performance is anticipated before the date set for performance 
(art. 7.3.3). Termination does not require the involvement of an adjudicator and 
can be effected by simple notice (art.  7.3.2). It releases both parties from their 
obligations (art. 7.3.5) and requires a party that has already received performance 
to return all or some of what it has received (arts. 7.3.6–7).
382. 
Chapter 8 allows the parties to set off their obligations against each other 
if the obligations are of the same kind and certain other requirements are met 
(art. 8.1). The right of set-off is exercised by notice to the other party (arts. 8.3–4) 
and set-off, once effected, discharges the obligations for the future (art. 8.5).
383. 
Chapter 9 contains a detailed regime on the assignment of rights (chap. 9,  
sect. 1), the transfer of obligations (chap. 9, sect. 2) and the assignment of contracts 
(chap. 9, sect. 3). 
384. 
Chapter 10, on limitation periods, conceptualizes limitation as a defence 
that does not extinguish the right but bars its exercise if asserted (arts. 10.1 and 
10.9). It establishes a general period of three years and a maximum period of 
10 years (art. 10.2). The parties may modify the period within limits (art. 10.3). 
The limitation period may be suspended by judicial or other proceedings and in 
the case of force majeure or other unforeseen circumstances (arts. 10.5–8). There 
are many overlaps with, and some differences from, the Limitation Convention 
(see chap. IV, sect. B, above).
385. 
Chapter 11 deals with legal issues arising from a plurality of obligors (i.e., 
a scenario where the performance of a contractual obligation is owed by more than 
one obligor (chap. 11, sect. 1)), or a plurality of obligees (i.e., a scenario where the 
performance of a contractual obligation is owed to more than one obligee (chap. 11, 
sect. 2)). 
11. 
Selected features 
386. 
Many of the rules of the UPICC are specifically designed for the particular 
requirements of international trade. These include provisions on the relevant 
time zone (art. 1.12), linguistic discrepancies between versions of the contract 
(art. 4.7), public permission requirements (arts. 6.1.14–17), currency of payment 
(arts. 6.1.9–10) and the currency in which damages are to be assessed (art. 7.4.12). 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
85
387. 
In the same way as those of the CISG (see para. 129 above), the rules of 
the UPICC must be interpreted autonomously or, in other words, without having 
regard to the established legal terminology of national contract laws (art.  1.6, 
para.  1). Gaps should be settled, as far as possible, not by recourse to domestic 
laws but in accordance with the general principles underlying the instrument 
(art. 1.6, para. 2) (see para. 394 below). 
388. 
In a similar vein, the UPICC do not normally make it explicit if they deviate 
from established national doctrines of contract law. Articles 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 constitute 
a rare exception in that they clarify that domestic requirements as to indicia of 
seriousness, such as the doctrines of consideration or cause, or domestic views as 
to initial impossibility as an impediment to performance, are irrelevant as potential 
grounds of invalidity (art. 3.1.3).
389. 
Most of the rules contained in the UPICC are default rules. They do not 
apply if the parties have agreed to the contrary. Only some of its provisions are 
mandatory and cannot be contracted out (art. 1.5). These include the duty of the 
parties to act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing (art. 1.7), the provisions 
of chapter 3 on validity (art. 3.1.4) and the limits on the potential modification of 
limitation periods by the parties (art. 10.3, para. 2). However, given the non-binding 
status of the UPICC, it may be impossible to enforce the mandatory character in 
a given case (see para. 103 above). 
390. 
The non-binding character of the UPICC may also affect the application of 
their rules that are designed to deal with three-party relationships, such as agency 
(chap. 2, sect. 2), contracts in favour of third parties (chap. 5, sect. 2), assignment 
of rights, transfer of obligations and assignment of contracts (chap. 9) and plurality 
of obligors and obligees (chap. 11). It may be the case that the relevant rule of the 
UPICC will apply merely to one of the two-party relationships that, together, con-
stitute the tripartite relationship. For example, the rules on agency may apply between 
the principal and the other party, but not between the principal and the agent or 
between the agent and the other party. 
391. 
The UPICC do not set forth a rule providing for the overt policing of unfair 
standard terms. Instead they contain a number of provisions that are designed to 
protect parties with less experience and inferior bargaining power. These include 
the prohibition on invoking grossly unfair exemption clauses (art. 7.1.6), the reduc-
tion of grossly excessive penalty clauses (art. 7.4.13), the avoidance of the contract 
in cases of gross disparity (art. 3.2.7), the contra proferentem rule in the interpreta-
tion of contracts (art.  4.6) and the ineffectiveness of surprising standard terms 
(art. 2.1.20). Rules of this kind are notably absent from the CISG.
86 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
12. 
How do the UPICC interact with other  
uniform law instruments?
Relationship with the CISG and the Limitation Convention
392. 
The UPICC were drafted against the background of existing transnational 
commercial law, which included the CISG and the Limitation Convention (see 
para. 329 above). Since, however, the UPICC are intended to provide a system of 
rules especially tailored to the needs of international commercial transactions, they 
also embody what are perceived to be the best solutions, even if still not yet gener-
ally adopted.
393. 
When comparing the UPICC with the CISG and the Limitation Conven-
tion, three types of provisions may be distinguished: (a) provisions addressing the 
same issues; (b) provisions addressing the same subject matter, but to a different 
level of detail; and (c) provisions addressing issues excluded from the scope of 
appli cation of the CISG and the Limitation Convention. It is specifically with 
 regard to the second and the third of these that the function of the UPICC as a 
means of interpreting and supplementing international uniform law instruments 
may be  relevant (see paras. 351–352 above).
394. 
First, some of the provisions address exactly the same issues as the conven-
tions. They are usually taken either literally or at least in substance from the corre-
sponding rules of the conventions. Notable examples include the rules on offer and 
acceptance (UPICC, arts. 2.1.2–11; and CISG, arts. 14–24 (see paras. 157–172. 
above)), on the foreseeability of harm (UPICC, art. 7.4.4; and CISG, art. 74 (see 
para. 273 above)) and on force majeure (UPICC, art. 7.1.7; and CISG, art. 79 (see 
para. 277 above)). In some instances, the rules are virtually identical, but there are 
slight, if important differences. Both the CISG and the UPICC, for example, con-
tain rules on the interpretation and supplementation of the instrument (see 
paras. 133–137 above). However, in contrast to article 7, paragraph 2, of the CISG, 
article 1.6, paragraph 2, of the UPICC does not refer the adjudicator to domestic 
law as a last resort in cases where gaps cannot be filled by recourse to the general 
principles underlying the instrument. Both instruments consider the contractual 
parties to be bound to usages widely known to and regularly observed in inter-
national trade (see paras. 138–142 above). Yet, in contrast to article 9, paragraph 2, 
of the CISG, article 1.9, paragraph 2, of the UPICC does not require the parties’ 
actual or constructive knowledge of a particular usage to make it binding.
395. 
Second, some of the provisions address subject matter that is also covered 
by the conventions. This concerns many of the rules on formation, damages and 
limitation periods. In these cases, there is a broad overlap between the UPICC 
and the conventions although, once again, the former sometimes go beyond the 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
87
solutions of, or are at least more explicit than, the latter. Article 2.1.1 of the UPICC, 
for example, expressly recognizes that contracts may be concluded not only by the 
acceptance of an offer, but also by other conduct of the parties that is sufficient to 
show agreement. The UPICC also contain specific rules on writings in confirma-
tion, on cases where the parties made the conclusion of a contract dependent upon 
reaching an agreement on specific matters or in a specific form and on merger and 
no-oral-modification clauses (arts. 2.1.12–13 and 2.1.17–18), none of which is 
expressly covered by the CISG. Moreover, while the CISG only recognizes a role 
for good faith in international trade (art. 7, para. 1), the UPICC set forth a general 
and far-reaching duty of the parties to act in accordance with good faith and fair 
dealing throughout the life of the contract, including the negotiations (arts. 1.7, 
1.8 and 2.1.15). The rules on contractual interpretation in chapter 4 of the UPICC 
are substantially more detailed and comprehensive than those on the same topic 
in article 8 of the CISG, with, among others, specific provisions on interpretation 
contra proferentem, the interpretation of multilingual texts and gap-filling (see 
paras.  133–137 above). The CISG does not contain specific rules on standard 
terms, whereas the UPICC contain a detailed set of provisions, most importantly 
on the incorporation of such terms and the “battle of the forms” (arts. 2.1.19–22) 
(see paras. 171–172 above). Further issues covered by the UPICC but not  expressly 
covered by the CISG include exemption clauses (art.  7.1.6), interest rates (arts. 
7.4.9–10) and agreed payment for non-performance (art.  7.4.13). In rare cases, 
the UPICC deliberately depart from the previous conventions. For example, their 
general limitation period of three years (art. 10.2) differs from the four-year period 
of article 8 of the Limitation Convention.86 
396. 
Third, many of the provisions of the UPICC cover issues that are expressly 
excluded from the scope of application of the conventions, such as the substantive 
validity of contracts (chap. 3; see also art. 4 of the CISG and paras. 119–122 above), 
or issues that are obviously beyond their scope. The latter include the rules on the 
authority of agents (chap. 2, sect. 2), contracts in favour of third parties (chap. 5, 
sect. 2), set-off (chap. 8), assignment of rights, transfer of obligations and assignment 
of contracts (chap. 9) and the plurality of obligors and obligees (chap. 11). 
397. 
Many, but not all, of these topics are dealt with because the UPICC are not 
restricted to sales contracts but apply to all types of international commercial contracts. 
Some of the provisions that have no equivalent in the conventions are specifically 
tailored to service contracts, not least long-term contracts and so-called “relational 
contracts”, whereas the CISG and the Limitation Convention tend to focus on 
individual, one-off transactions. These include the formation of contracts with terms 
deliberately left open (art. 2.1.14), the unwinding of failed contracts (arts. 3.2.15 
and 7.3.7), the duty of cooperation (art. 5.1.3), the determination of the quality of 
86 See chapter IV, section B, above for a comparison of provisions of the Limitation Convention and of the UPICC.

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
performance (art.  5.1.6), the unilateral cancellation of contracts for an indefinite 
period (art. 5.1.8) and hardship (arts. 6.2.1–3). In the 2016 edition of the UPICC, 
six existing articles and many of the existing comments were substantially amended 
to better address the special requirements of long-term contracts. Also in that edition, 
a specific definition was provided in article 1.11 of “long-term contract” as “a contract 
which is to be performed over a period of time and which normally involves, to a 
varying degree, complexity of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between 
the parties”.
Relationship with the HCCH Principles
398. 
The HCCH Principles are particularly important for promoting the applica-
bility, by agreement, of the UPICC. This is achieved by article 3 of the HCCH Prin-
ciples, one of the most innovative rules in the Principles. As discussed in chapter III.B 
above, article 3 furthers party autonomy by expressly permitting the choice of non-
State “rules of law” as the law governing the contract if such rules are “generally 
accepted on an international, supranational or regional level as a neutral and balanced 
set of rules”. In paragraph  3.6 of the commentary on the HCCH Principles, the 
UPICC are explicitly mentioned as a prime example of such a set of rules.
399. 
The HCCH Principles therefore offer a solution to the practice of many 
States that do not authorize their courts to give effect to the choice of the parties 
to make non-State law the law governing the contract (see paras. 59–61 above).
D. Uniform Rules on Contract Clauses for an 
Agreed  Sum Due upon Failure of Performance 
400. 
International commercial contracts often include clauses providing that an 
agreed sum is to be paid upon failure to perform. The nature of such payment may 
be compensation (“liquidated damages clauses”) or may be a penalty (“penalty 
clauses”). Domestic laws vary on the treatment of such clauses, particularly as to 
their validity, the judge’s power to reduce the agreed sum and the possibility of 
claiming damages when the loss exceeds the agreed sum. The Uniform Rules on 
Contract Clauses for an Agreed Sum Due upon Failure of Performance (1983), 
prepared by UNCITRAL, are a soft-law instrument that provides uniform rules on 
those issues. The instrument is contractual in nature and is applicable when the 
parties agree to incorporate it into their contract. 
401. 
The Uniform Rules apply to international contracts containing contract 
 clauses for an agreed sum due upon failure to perform (art. 1). For the purpose of 
the Uniform Rules, a contract is international if the parties have their places of 
IV. Substantive law of international sales 
89
business in different States (art. 2, para. (a)). The definition of “international” is 
the same as in the CISG (arts. 2 and 3; see also arts. 1 and 10 of the CISG). The 
Uniform Rules do not apply to contracts concerning goods, other property or 
services which are to be supplied for the personal, family or household purposes 
of a party, unless the other party, at any time before or at the conclusion of the 
contract, neither knew nor ought to have known that the contract was concluded 
for such purposes (art. 4).
402. 
The Uniform Rules do not make actual loss a requirement to claim the 
agreed sum, but provide that the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum irrespective 
of the actual loss. This rule is contained also in article 7.4.13, paragraph 1, of the 
UPICC, which indicates that “the aggrieved party is entitled to that sum irrespec-
tive of its actual harm”. On the other hand, under the Uniform Rules, the obligee 
is entitled to the agreed sum only if the obligor is liable for the failure of perfor-
mance (art. 5). Thus, for example, if a party is exempt from liability according to 
articles 79 or 80 of the CISG, that party need not pay the agreed sum even if there 
was an agreement to pay an agreed sum in the case of failure to perform. The par-
ties may derogate from or vary the effect of this rule (Uniform Rules, art. 9), subject 
to validity rules under the applicable domestic law.
1. 
Relationship with right to specific performance
403. 
If the contract provides that the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum upon 
delay in performance, the obligee is also entitled to performance of the obligation 
in addition to the agreed sum (art.  6, para.  1). If the contract provides that the 
obligee is entitled to the agreed sum upon a failure of performance other than 
delay, the obligee is entitled either to performance (e.g., repair of non-conforming 
goods) or to the agreed sum. If, however, the agreed sum cannot reasonably be 
regarded as compensation for that failure of performance, the obligee is entitled to 
both performance of the obligation and the agreed sum (art. 6, para. 2). The parties 
may derogate from or vary the effect of this rule (art. 9).
2. 
Relationship with right to damages
404. 
If the obligee is entitled to the agreed sum, no damages may be claimed to 
the extent of the loss covered by the agreed sum. Nevertheless, the obligee may 
claim damages to the extent of the loss not covered by the agreed sum if the loss 
substantially exceeds the agreed sum (art.  7). The parties may derogate from or 
vary the effect of this rule (art. 9).

3. 
Reduction of the agreed sum by the court or 
arbitral tribunal
405. 
In principle, the court or arbitral tribunal does not have the power to reduce 
the agreed sum. However, the court or arbitral tribunal is granted the power to 
reduce the agreed sum if it is substantially disproportionate in relation to the loss 
that has been suffered by the obligee (art.  8). The UPICC adopt a similar rule 
(art. 7.4.13, para. 2). This is a mandatory rule and the parties may not derogate 
from it or vary its effect (Uniform Rules, art. 9).
E. Regional texts
Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa 
Uniform Act on General Commercial Law
406. 
Commercial sale within the framework of the Organization for the Harmo-
nization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) is provided for in articles 234–302 
of the OHADA Uniform Act on General Commercial Law of 15 December 2010.
407. Based largely on the CISG, the Uniform Act’s provisions on commercial sale 
state that they apply to contracts for the sale of goods and that, unless otherwise 
stipulated, a commercial sales contract is subject to the provisions of the Uniform Act 
when the contracting parties have their main place of business in one of the States parties 
to OHADA or when PIL rules result in the application of the law of a State party.
408. 
In addition to the substantive scope of application being the same for com-
mercial sale under OHADA and the CISG (sale of goods), the two texts are also 
clearly and indisputably identical in respect of their rules on the formation of a 
contract, the obligations of the parties to a contract for the sale of goods, the effects 
of that contract and the rules governing non-performance of the contract and the 
determination of related liability.
409. 
When the parties to a contract have their main place of business in States 
parties to OHADA, the law applicable to the contract is the Uniform Act. When 
the States parties to OHADA are also parties to the CISG, the Uniform Act remains 
applicable in accordance with article 10 of the OHADA Treaty on the Harmoniza-
tion of Business Law in Africa, pursuant to which uniform acts are directly appli-
cable to and binding on the States parties. The Uniform Act on General Commercial 
Law would only not be applicable if the parties to the contract had agreed on 
different provisions.

91
F. Model contracts based on uniform texts 
1. 
ICC Model International Sales Contract and developing 
neutral legal standards for international contracts
410. 
The ICC produces a robust and wide-ranging series of international com-
mercial model contracts and clauses that provide a sound legal basis upon which 
global traders can quickly establish an even-handed agreement acceptable to both 
sides in international transactions.
411. 
The foundational pillars of the ICC model contract series relate to global 
trade in goods, including models on agency, distributorship, franchising and con-
fidentiality. All the ICC models are constructed to take balanced account of the 
interests of all the parties, combining a single framework of rules with flexible 
provisions allowing the parties to insert their own requirements.
412. 
The ICC model contracts usually contain provisions on the applicable law, 
and refer to international instruments as the default rule, leaving it to the parties 
to modify this choice if they so prefer. For example, the ICC Model International 
Sale Contract (Manufactured Goods), published for the first time in 1997 and 
reviewed and updated in 2020, contains a reference to the application of the CISG 
in its general conditions. Article 1.2, in particular, states that any questions which 
are not settled in the contract itself (including agreed general conditions) shall be 
governed by the CISG and, to the extent that such questions are not covered by 
the CISG and no applicable law has been agreed upon, by reference to the law of 
the seller’s place of business. Parties wishing to choose a law other than that of the 
seller’s place of business to govern questions not covered by the CISG are encour-
aged to do so in the first part of the Model Contract, where individual terms can 
be negotiated. It should also be highlighted that, in drafting the terms of the con-
tract and general conditions themselves, the ICC used the CISG as the primary 
model for the default clauses.
413. 
Most of the other model contracts contain a reference to the application of 
general principles of commercial law and to the UPICC. For example, according 
to article 24.1 of the ICC Model Contract on Commercial Agency, any question 
not expressly or implicitly settled by contractual provisions shall be governed by 
the principles of law generally recognized in international trade as applicable to 
international agency contracts, by the relevant trade usages and by the UPICC, in 
that order.
414. 
The ICC has also developed stand-alone clauses to address specific issues, 
such as force majeure or hardship, which influenced the language used by the 
92 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
UPICC provisions on regulating these issues (see art. 7.1.7, on force majeure, and 
arts. 6.2.1–6.2.3, on hardship). In turn, the UPICC have played a role in the most 
recent revision of such clauses, particularly the Hardship Clause.87
2. 
International Trade Centre guidance texts 
415. 
The International Trade Centre has prepared a guide to preparing inter-
national commercial contracts,88 as well as a compilation of model contracts.89 
Those texts provide practical guidance on the conclusion of international 
 commercial contracts, focusing on the needs of small firms and making frequent 
reference to uniform texts such as the CISG and the UPICC. 
3. 
International Bar Association drafting guide 
416. 
Bearing in mind the various requirements of international contracts and 
cross-border transactions, and in particular the need to take into account several 
documents when drafting those contracts, the International Sales Committee of 
the International Bar Association produced Cross-Border Transactions: A Drafting 
Guide for International Sales Contracts. The goal of the Guide is to offer practitioners 
and entrepreneurs a user-friendly checklist of the main issues to be taken into 
account.
417. 
The Guide is divided into 10 chapters dealing with, among others, preparing 
for a visit to the foreign country, the substantive law on sales (particularly focused 
on the CISG), soft-law matters, currency and payment issues, export regulations, 
resale in the importing country, dispute resolution and tax treaties. It also provides 
a specimen form of distribution agreement. Each chapter contains short comments 
and a collection of websites to allow readers to further investigate the topics they 
are interested in. The Guide was last updated in 2015.

V. Recurring legal issues arising in 
connection with sales contracts 
A. Use of electronic means 
418. 
The use of electronic information in contractual transactions, including 
across borders, has become prevalent for a number of reasons, including speed of 
transmission, ability to access data remotely and anytime, and the possibility of 
reusing data. It has also raised several issues with respect to the legal status of 
electronic information.
419. 
UNCITRAL has prepared texts that address contractual matters related to 
the use of electronic information. Those texts include the UNCITRAL Model Law 
on Electronic Commerce (1996),90 the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Sig-
natures (2001),91 the Electronic Communications Convention (see paras. 425–430 
below) and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records 
(2017).92 Guidance texts have also been prepared by UNCITRAL in the areas of 
cross-border recognition of electronic signatures93 and contractual aspects of cloud 
computing contracts.94 
420. 
UNCITRAL texts on electronic commerce are based on the three funda-
mental principles: (a) technology neutrality; (b) non-discrimination against the 
use of electronic information; and (c) functional equivalence. 
421. 
The principle of technology neutrality requires that legislation not impose 
the use of or otherwise favour any specific technology, method or product. Under 
the principle of non-discrimination, a communication is not to be denied validity 
on the sole ground that it is in electronic form. Under the principle of functional 
equivalence, electronic communications may satisfy the purposes and functions of

94 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
paper-based documents, provided that certain criteria are met. UNCITRAL texts 
provide functional equivalence rules for the paper-based notions of writing, signa-
ture, original, retention and transferable document or instrument.
422. 
UNCITRAL texts also provide rules on various aspects of electronic con-
tracting, as well as on the use of electronic signatures, which may perform functions 
additional to those fulfilled by paper-based signatures. 
423. In particular, part one, chapter III, of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Elec-
tronic Commerce deals with aspects directly relevant for electronic contracting, 
such as: formation and validity of contracts (art.  11); recognition by parties 
(art. 12) and attribution of data messages (art. 13), including acknowledgment of 
their receipt (art. 14); and time and place of dispatch and receipt of data messages 
(art.  15). Since a very large number of jurisdictions have already adopted the 
UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, the uniform law of electronic 
contracting set forth in those provisions has already gained broad acceptance.
424. 
Additional areas relevant for the use of electronic information in contractual 
transactions include privacy and data protection law, consumer protection law (the 
rules of which may also apply under certain circumstances to non-consumers) and 
payments law.
Electronic Communications Convention and its relation to the CISG 
and the Limitation Convention
425. 
The Electronic Communications Convention pursues several goals related 
to establishing legal certainty in the use of electronic communications across bor-
ders. One of those goals is legally enabling the use of electronic communications 
in treaties concluded before the widespread use of electronic means.
426. 
To that end, it is declared in article 20 of the Electronic Communications 
Convention that the provisions of that Convention will apply to electronic com-
munications exchanged in connection with the formation or performance of a 
contract to which a number of treaties apply. Among the treaties listed in article 20 
are the CISG and the Limitation Convention, as well as the Convention on the 
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958).95 As the list of 
treaties is not exhaustive, the Electronic Communications Convention may apply 
to any international agreement applicable to a contract concluded across borders. 
427.

Convention on the one hand, and the CISG and the Limitation Convention on 
95 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 330, No. 4739.
V. Recurring legal issues arising in connection with sales contracts 
95
the other, is the extension to the latter treaties of the principles of technology 
neutrality, non-discrimination against the use of electronic information and func-
tional equivalence that underlie UNCITRAL texts on electronic commerce.
428. 
For instance, article 9 of the Electronic Communications Convention estab-
lishes the requirements for the functional equivalence between written and elec-
tronic form. Electronic communications compliant with those requirements will 
also satisfy written form requirements under the CISG when both the Electronic 
Communications Convention and the CISG apply.
429. 
Article 6 of the Electronic Communications Convention provides guidance 
on the determination of the place of business when electronic means are used. The 
notion of place of business is relevant to determine the applicability of the CISG 
and of the Limitation Convention. 
430. 
The Electronic Communications Convention also contains provisions rele-
vant for electronic contracting, namely on: (a) time and place of dispatch and 
 receipt (art.  10, updating art.  15 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic 
Commerce); (b) invitations to make offers (art. 11, complementing art. 14, para. 2, 
of the CISG); (c) use of automated message systems (art. 12); and (d) input errors 
made by natural persons (art. 14). 
B. Distribution contracts 
431. Distribution contracts might respond to different kinds of modalities in busi-
ness practice. Basically, under a distribution contract, the supplier agrees to supply 
the distributor with goods on a continuing basis and the distributor agrees to pur-
chase them and to resell them to others in the distributor’s name and on the dis-
tributor’s behalf. No uniform definition of a distribution contract and no uniform 
characterization exist, either nationally or internationally; domestically, therefore, 
such a contract can be considered as a modality or subtype of a sale of goods contract 
or an autonomous contract itself. Under a distribution contract, the parties foresee 
a long-term relationship that is often cooperative (see paragraphs 397 above and 
433 below for the definition of “long-term contracts” under the UPICC). 
432. 
In some distribution contracts, apart from the obligation to distribute the 
goods, certain other obligations are agreed between the parties, such as obligations 
of marketing, distribution and development of advertising or marketing of the 
goods, non-competition clauses, technical assistance, industrial or intellectual 
rights or the obligation to follow certain instructions from the supplier and, finally, 
exclusivity obligations (exclusivity to sell or to buy within a certain territory or to 
a certain group of distributors or customers). The obligation of exclusivity can take 
96 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
the form of an obligation to buy the goods only from the supplier, an obligation 
to sell exclusively to certain distributors that meet certain requirements, or an 
 obligation to supply to only one distributor in a territory or to supply to a certain 
group of customers. 
433. 
At the international level, there is no dedicated uniform instrument dealing 
with distribution contracts. At a more general level, the UPICC cover them as 
long-term contracts, whose definition refers to “a contract which is to be performed 
over a period of time and which normally involves, to a varying degree, complexity 
of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between the parties” (art. 1.11).96 
The UPICC juxtapose long-term contracts with simpler transactions such as sales 
contracts to be performed once (see also para. 397 above).
434. 
Most courts have concluded that the CISG does not apply to distribution 
contracts (the so-called “framework agreement”), as these contracts are focused on 
the “organization of the distribution” rather than the trade in goods. However, the 
CISG may apply to sale of goods contracts concluded on the basis of the distribu-
tion contract if all the conditions for the applicability (internationality, sale of 
goods, etc.) of the CISG are met.
435. 
Furthermore, although this interpretation is not settled, the CISG has been 
applied to the framework agreement in situations in which the framework agree-
ment takes the form of a supply of goods agreement and contains the goods, quan-
tity and price, or the basis for the future determination of the quantity and price 
(arts. 8, 9, 14, para. 1, and 55). If this is the case, the contractual obligations derived 
from the framework agreement could be analysed under CISG rules, including the 
exclusivity obligations without prejudice to other rules, such as competition obliga-
tions, being observed under the otherwise domestic applicable law, since competi-
tion issues are not covered by the CISG. 
436. 
In the absence of a uniform international treaty in this area, the parties 
might exclude the uncertainties derived from the application of the CISG to inter-
national distribution contracts by opting into the CISG alone or in conjunction 
with the UPICC as the law or rules of law applicable to the contract (“opting in”).
96 Comment 3 to art. 1.11 UPICC and several illustrations contained in the UPICC refer to distribution contracts.
V. Recurring legal issues arising in connection with sales contracts 
97
C. Agency 
437. 
Agency contracts might be defined as those contracts between principal and 
agent whereby the agent has authority or purports to have authority on behalf of 
another person, the principal, to conclude a contract of sale of goods with a third 
party (see article 1, paragraph 1, on the sphere of application, of the Convention on 
Agency in the International Sale of Goods,97 the HCCH 1978 Agency Convention 
(see paras. 52–54 above) and article 2.2.1, paragraph 1, of the UPICC).98 In this 
regard, acting either in the name of the agent or in that of the principal is possible.
438. 
Generally, the agent may act in relation not only to the conclusion of the 
international sale of goods contract but also to the performance of that contract. 
Hence, certain provisions of the CISG may apply to the agent.
439. 
During the formation of the contract, the agent might be the one dealing 
with the offer or, alternatively, an invitation to make an offer (CISG, art. 14, para. 1). 
In the latter situation, this is the case if the agent does not have the authority to 
conclude the contract on behalf of the principal since the proposal cannot certainly 
contain an intention to be bound in the case of acceptance and so the agent will 
send the invitation to make an offer with a wording indicating no such intention, 
for example, “without my consent” or “save acceptance by the principal”. 
440. 
During the performance of the contract, among other instances, the agent 
might be the person who receives from the buyer the notice about the lack of 
conformity of the goods under article 39, paragraph 1, of the CISG. In those cir-
cumstances, the problems related to the scope of authority of the agent should be 
resolved in accordance with the otherwise applicable domestic law or rules of law 
chosen by the parties.
441. 
Furthermore, in relation to the field of application of the CISG, particular 
challenges might arise in determining the application of the CISG (arts. 1 and 10), 
in particular, in the case of undisclosed agency. Generally, the place of business of 
the agent will not have the closest relationship to the contract and its performance, 
but that would be the case in terms of the place of business of the principal.
442. 
The UPICC contain a fully fledged set of rules on agency in its chapter 2, 
referring to the formation of the contract and covering the authority of the agent 
to affect the legal relations of the principal by or with respect to a contract with a 
97 The Convention, which has not yet entered into force, is aimed at supplementing the aspects of the agency rela-
tionship in an international sale of goods transaction between principal and agent that are not covered by the CISG.
98 In fact, the UPICC intervened in this area for general contract law and replaced those rules with a more 
coherent and complete set of rules, although of course non-binding.
98 
Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
third party, whether the agent acts in the name of the agent or in that of the prin-
cipal. The chapter governs only the relations between the principal or the agent on 
the one hand, and the third party on the other, and it is not concerned with the 
internal relations between the principal and the agent, which are governed by the 
contract and the otherwise applicable law. It deals with the scope of the agency 
(art. 2.2.2, following the general rule that the granting of authority to the agent by 
the principal is not subject to any particular requirement of form and the rule that 
the scope of the authority is to perform all acts necessary to achieve the purposes 
for which the authority was granted), the difference between “disclosed” and “un-
disclosed” agency (arts. 2.2.3–4), the situation in which the agent acts with no 
authority or exceeds the authority, including the possible ratification by the principal 
(arts. 2.2.5–6 and 2.2.9), conflict of interests as a ground for avoidance of the 
contract (art. 2.2.7), appointment of a subagent, which is considered to be within 
the implied authority of the agent (art.  2.2.8), and termination of the authority 
(art. 2.2.10). The UPICC, in contrast to a number of legal systems, do not distinguish 
between “direct” and “indirect” representation; they do not refer to situations in 
which the agent’s authority is conferred by law or is derived from judicial authori-
zation; and they do not prevail over special rules governing agents of companies 
under mandatory applicable laws in the case of conflict between those rules and 
the UPICC rules (see also paras. 341 and 390 above).
D. Software, data and intellectual property issues 
443. 
Transactions in digital information, particularly when the information is de-
tached from the tangible medium on which the information is stored, are a fairly 
new phenomenon, and the legal framework is still an unsettled matter. Such trans-
actions began with the emergence of computer software as an independent subject 
matter of trade, and quickly grew to include digital content such as music, e-books 
and applications. There are different approaches among jurisdictions regarding the 
characterization of such transactions for the purposes of determining which legal 
regime is applicable. Some jurisdictions apply the law appli cable to the sale of goods, 
either by direct application of governing statutes or by analogy. Others treat trans-
actions in digital information as ordinary contracts not governed by special regimes 
for the sale of goods or as licence contracts, and some are developing a sui generis 
contract law applicable to transactions of digital content.99
444. 
Against this background, the question of whether transactions in digital infor-
mation (software, computer programs, applications, music, e-books, smart goods, 
etc.) are within the scope of the CISG poses a challenge to the interpretation of the 
99 See, for example, directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 
on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.
V. Recurring legal issues arising in connection with sales contracts 
99
CISG. This issue was not foreseen when the CISG was adopted in 1980. Different 
views are expressed. The issue involves both the definition of “goods” (e.g., the question 
of whether goods must be tangible) and the nature of the transaction (e.g., sale, 
licence of property or access to data not protected by a property regime). Due con-
sideration must also be given to the desirability of achieving uniformity of law by a 
broad application of the CISG on the one hand, and the desirability of developing 
a suitable rule tailored to changing modern information technology on the other.
445. 
One issue that is generally agreed, however, is that transactions in digital 
information should be distinguished from transactions in the underlying intellectual 
property (e.g., copyrights and patents) if the information is protected by such a 
regime. The party supplying the digital information, whether it is the holder of the 
intellectual property of that information, a person granted a licence to supply the 
digital information to a third person, or a person with control over access to data 
that are not protected by intellectual property rules, is merely granting the other 
party a right to use the digital information within the confines of their contract 
and the applicable intellectual property law. The intellectual property may or may 
not be retained by the holder. 
446. 
Intellectual property is, to a large extent, harmonized through international 
conventions such as the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic 
Works (1886),100 the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property 
(1883)101 and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (1994).102 However, owing to the principle of territoriality, it is the law of 
the territory in which intellectual property is protected that determines the extent 
of protection of intellectual property. In international trade, this causes the problem 
that rights in intellectual property are determined independently from jurisdiction 
to jurisdiction. In the light of this problem, article  42 of the CISG provides a 
uniform rule regarding which law is relevant in determining whether the goods 
infringe the intellectual property of a third person, for the purpose of determining 
whether the seller has fulfilled the obligation to deliver goods free from any right 
or claim by a third party based on intellectual property.
447. 
It should be noted as well that the American Law Institute and the European 
Law Institute have embarked on a joint project aimed at establishing principles to 
govern the emerging data economy, in particular, transactions in electronic data. 
If that endeavour succeeds, and the resulting soft-law document proves influential, 
the result may be greater harmonization in the area and the possibility of future 
work by international organizations.

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
E. Countertrade and barter 
448. 
In contracts for the sale of goods, including those falling under the scope 
of the CISG, the property over goods is transferred against the payment of a price 
in a currency. However, it may be also transferred, in full or in part, against transfer 
of property over other goods. That contract is commonly referred to as “barter”. 
449. 
In 1992, UNCITRAL adopted the Legal Guide on International Countertrade 
Transactions,103 which provides guidance on contractual solutions to different types 
of countertrade transactions, defined as “transactions in which one party supplies 
goods, services, technology or other economic value to the second party, and, in 
return, the first party purchases from the second party an agreed amount of goods, 
services, technology or other economic value”. The link between trans actions must 
be explicit. Under that Guide, countertrade transactions include barter, counter-
purchase, buy-back and offset.104
450. 
Provided that they are of an international character and between commer-
cial parties, barter and other countertrade transactions are clearly within the scope 
of application of the UPICC (see para. 354 above), which is broader than that of 
the CISG. 
451. 
Different views exist on the applicability of the provisions of the CISG to 
barter contracts. Elements such as the definition of the notion of price in the CISG 
may influence those views. In general, the provisions of the CISG have often been 
applied to barter contracts to the extent that the relevant issue is common to both 
sale of goods and barter contracts, but have not been applied when the relevant 
issue has a different legal treatment in sale of goods and barter contracts. 
452. 
As far as uniform instruments of PIL are concerned, there seems to be 
consensus that instruments governing the law applicable to international sale of 
goods do not apply to contracts that involve the transfer of goods in exchange for 
something other than money. Instruments governing contracts more generally – 
such as the Rome I Regulation – do apply to barter, etc., but only as far as their 
general rules are concerned; the specific rules for contracts of sale, on the other 
hand, do not apply.

104 With regard to offsets, namely, contracts between a private and a public entity concluded as a condition for 
the sale of goods or services in the public procurement market, see also the ICC- European Club for Countertrade 
and Offset “Guide to international offset contracts” (Paris, 2019), available on the ICC website, which makes 
reference to the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement (Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-
sixth Session, Supplement No. 17 (A/66/17), para. 192 and annex I), as well as to European law.

The UNCITRAL secretariat has established a system for collecting and disseminat-
ing information on court decisions and arbitral awards relating to UNCITRAL 
texts that is named “Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts” (CLOUT). The purpose of 
the system is to promote awareness, uniform interpretation and application of 
those texts. The CLOUT system is available on the UNCITRAL website in the six 
official languages of the United Nations. 
The CLOUT system includes a database of abstracts of court decisions and arbitral 
awards applying the CISG, the Limitation Convention, the United Nations Con-
vention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts and 
other UNCITRAL texts.
The UNCITRAL Digest of Case Law on the United Nations Convention on Con-
tracts for the International Sale of Goods presents, in a clear, concise and objective 
manner, the main trends in the interpretation and application of the CISG. The 
Digest is updated regularly and is available on the UNCITRAL website.
The United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law contains lectures on 
the CISG (“The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
Sale of Goods (part I): purposes, background, history, nature, scope and application”; 
and “Part II: issues covered and key substantive provisions”, by Harry M. Flechtner) 
and on UNCITRAL texts on electronic commerce (“Legal aspects of electronic 
commerce in international trade (part I): electronic contracting: economic context 
and private law”, and “Part II: electronic authentication and signature methods:

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
The UNILEX database contains case law and a bibliography on the UPICC. 
 UNILEX collects arbitral awards and the decisions of national courts, providing 
abstracts and keywords in English, as well as the original text, when available. It 
permits searches not only by date, court or arbitral tribunal, and articles of the 
UPICC, but also by “issues” listed under each article in a systematic order; since 
2019 it has allowed users to search cases by type of contract, nationality of the 
parties, and international or domestic law.
Unidroit publishes the Uniform Law Review (an Oxford University Press publication 
since 2013), which contains the proceedings of various conferences on the UPICC 
organized by Unidroit, including “20 Years of Unidroit Principles of Inter-
national Commercial Contracts: experiences and prospects” (Uniform Law Review, 
vol.  19, No.  4 (December 2014)); and Uniform Law Review, vol.  22, No.  1 
(March 2017), on the theme “United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
Inter national Sale of Goods (CISG), Unidroit Principles of International Com-
mercial Contracts: contrast and convergence”. Unidroit also published Eppur Si 
Muove: The Age of Uniform Law – Essays in Honour of Michael Joachim Bonell to 
Celebrate his 70th Birthday (Rome, Unidroit, 2016), which contains a section on 
the UPICC (pp. 1197–1713).
The texts of the 1964 Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International 
Sale of Goods and the 1964 Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the Formation 
of International Contracts of Sale of Goods are available on the Unidroit website 
in English and French, as is the Commentary by André Tunc.
All other Unidroit instruments are accessible on the Unidroit website in English 
and French as well as in other languages depending on the instrument. In particular, 
the Legal Guide on Contract Farming by Unidroit, the Food and Agriculture Or-
ganization of the United Nations and the International Fund for Agricultural De-
velopment is available in English, French, Spanish, Chinese and Portuguese. The Guide 
to International Master Franchise Arrangements is available in English and French.

B. Other resources
Many materials are available on uniform international commercial contract law. 
The information provided here is aimed at offering orientation to those materials 
and is not intended to be exhaustive. 
1. 
Determination of the law applicable to international  
commercial contracts
The HCCH secretariat (Permanent Bureau) maintains, on the HCCH website, a 
bibliography of materials on the HCCH instruments on the law applicable to inter­
national commercial contracts. 
A helpful resource in understanding the history and the contents of the HCCH 
Principles is Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts: Global Perspec-
tives on the Hague Principles, Daniel Girsberger, Thomas Kadner Graziano and 
Jan L. Neels, eds. (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2021). 
2. 
Substantive law of international sales
The UNCITRAL secretariat maintains a bibliography of UNCITRAL texts on the 
international sale of goods and on electronic commerce both as a yearly document 
and in a consolidated form. The materials listed in the bibliography are also avail­
able in the online catalogue of the UNCITRAL Law Library.
Commentaries on the CISG and related texts may provide significant assistance 
in research. The Commentary on the UN Convention on the International Sale of 
Goods (CISG) (Ingeborg Schwenzer, ed.) and the Uniform Law for International 
Sales under the 1980 United Nations Convention (Harry Flechtner, ed.) are regularly 
 updated. Other commentaries, such as Commentary on the International Sales Law: 
The 1980 Vienna Sales Convention (C. M. Bianca and Michael Joachim (Milan, 
Giuffrè, 1987)) and Commentary on International Sales Law (Fritz Enderlein and 
Dietrich Maskow (Bristol, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
Oceana Publications, 1992)), contain useful historical information. 
The CISG­Online Database at the University of Basel and the Pace Law Albert H. 
Kritzer CISG Database contain a very large number of cases and other materials 
on the CISG and related texts. Some cases are available in full and in the original 
language as well as in the English translation.

Legal Guide to Uniform Instruments in the Area of International Commercial Contracts
The CISG Advisory Council is a private academic organization that aims to 
 promote the uniform interpretation of the CISG in the light of its international 
character. It has prepared several opinions discussing topical CISG issues. The 
opinions are available at no cost on the Council’s website in several languages. 
3. 
Unidroit Principles on International  
Commercial Contracts 
Among the wealth of publications on the UPICC (and in addition to the resources 
cited above), the Commentary on the Unidroit Principles of International Commer-
cial Contracts (PICC) (2nd ed., Stefan Vogenauer, ed. (Oxford, Oxford University 
Press, 2015)) contains an article-by-article in-depth analysis. An overview of the 
origin and purposes of the Principles can be found in An International Restatement 
of Contract Law (3rd ed., Michael Joachim Bonell (New York, Transnational Pub-
lishers, 2005)). The same author published a recent review of the practical applica-
tion of the UPICC (“The law governing international commercial contracts and 
the actual role of the Unidroit Principles”, Uniform Law Review, vol. 23, No. 1 
(March 2018)). The International Bar Association published the results of its 
 research on the role of the UPICC in 2019 (Perspectives in Practice of the Unidroit 
Principles 2016: Views of the IBA Working Group on the practice of the Unidroit 
Principles 2016 (London, 2019)). The International Academy of Comparative Law 
has repeatedly chosen the UPICC as a topic. See, for example, the publication of 
the general and national reports presented at its twentieth congress, held in 
 Fukuoka, Japan, from 22 to 28 July 2018 (Alejandro M. Garro and José Antonio 
Moreno Rodríguez, eds., Use of the Unidroit Principles to Interpret and Supplement 
 Domestic Contract Law (Heidelberg, Springer, 2021)).
The text of the Principles of Reinsurance Contract Law, as well as further mater-
ials, can be found on the website of the Principles of Reinsurance Contract Law 
Working Group.
