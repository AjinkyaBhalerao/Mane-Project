PD FLASH - The good habits to protect personal data



Collecting and processing personal data in your job at MANE involves, above all, informing people about what you do with their data and respecting their rights.

Some good habits must be adopted for proper processing of personal data:
- Collect only the personal data strictly necessary;
- Be transparent: clear and complete information must be provided to the persons whose personal data is collected;
- Respect the rights of individuals: always bear in mind that the persons whose personal data are processed have the right to object, rectify, access and delete their data. In the event of a request of application of one of these rights, ask the person to contact dpo@mane.com and we will respond within one month;
- Identify the risks: if you process a lot of personal data or sensitive data contact the DPO, specific measures may need to be adopted;
- Secure data: IT but also physical measures must be taken to ensure the conservation and confidentiality of the personal data that you process.
