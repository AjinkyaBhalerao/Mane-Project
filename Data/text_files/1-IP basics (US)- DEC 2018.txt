DEFINITION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Intellectual Property (IP): Any product of the human intellect that the law protects from 
unauthorized use by others.  The ownership of intellectual property inherently creates 
a limited monopoly in the protected property.
Corporate IP generally includes Copyrights, Trademarks, Trade Secrets, & Patents.
Intellectual property rights allow creators, or owners, of the IP to benefit from their own 
work or investment in a creation.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)
Confidential | December 2018
COPYRIGHTS – 17 USC §§ 101-122
Copyright protects original and derivative works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.
•
Protect original works of authorship, per the US Constitution.
•
Literary works, music, dramatic works, pantomimes and choreographic works, 
sculptural, pictorial, and graphic works, sound recordings, artistic works, architectural 
works, and computer software. 
•
The owner has the exclusive rights to: reproduce, distribute copies, publically 
perform or display, and prepare derivative works based upon the work.
•
Fixed in a tangible medium of expression
•
Words/pictures on a piece of paper
•
Music notes written on a sheet. 
•
A US copyright exists from the moment the work is created.  To provide public 
notice of copyright, published works must be marked (©, date, and owner). If 
registered, certain statutory rights are available. 
•
There is no such thing as an “international copyright,” but foreign nations that 
are party to copyright international agreements with the US are afforded rights.  
9
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)
Confidential | December 2018
COPYRIGHTS – 17 USC §§ 101-122 
Duration - Limited per the US Constitution (Art. I, Sec. 8) 
•
Exact duration depends on when created, if/when published, if work for hire.
•
Today, new works are entitled to life of the author plus 70 years.
•
Today, work for hires are entitled to a term of 95 years from the year of its first 
publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever 
expires first.
A “work made for hire” is a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or 
her employment.
In the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other person for whom the work 
was prepared is considered the author, and owns all of the rights comprised in the 
copyright.
•
Unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument 
signed by them.

COPYRIGHTS – 17 USC §§ 101-122 
Examples:
•
Presentations, Advertisements, Marketing brochures, Websites, Scientific articles
•
BUT NOT patents (see Korzybski v. Underwood & Underwood, 36 F.2d 727, 729 (Cir. 1929))
The CR owner has the exclusive right to modify, distribute, perform, create, display, 
and copy the work … except for Fair Use (17 U.S.C. §107)
FAIR USE (defense):
• the purpose and character of the use
• transformative or value added
• merely copied
• the nature of the copyrighted work
• factual or fictional  
• published or unpublished
• the amount and substantiality of the portion taken
• small or large portion
• insignificant portion or “heart” of the work
• the effect of the use upon the potential market or value.
• no economic impact to owner
• deprive owner of potential economic gain

03 TRADEMARKS
12
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)
Confidential | December 2018
TRADEMARKS – 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051-1141
Trade/Service mark is a word, phrase, symbol, or design that provides distinctive identification for goods/services.
Trade or Service Mark - a distinctive sign, identifies a source for certain products or 
services, allows the consumer to distinguish them from other suppliers.
A trade/service mark registration - exclusive right to the use of the mark in interstate 
commerce for the registered class/goods/services.
In order to qualify for protection, the mark must be distinctive and not merely 
descriptive. 
fanciful > arbitrary > suggestive >> descriptive >>>> generic
(EXXON) > (APPLE) > (MICROSOFT) >> (HAIR SALON) >>>> (ASPIRIN)
Marks that are fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive are considered distinctive enough to 
function as trademarks. 
If a mark is descriptive, the mark may function as a trademark or service mark only if it 
has obtained secondary meaning. 
Generic words or phrases can never be a trademark.
® - denotes a registered mark (US Law)
TM - denotes common law use as a mark (US Law)
13
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)
Confidential | December 2018
TRADEMARKS – 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051-1141
Examples:
Classes 1-34 (goods) and 35-45 (services) for US and international (NICE)
Majority of trademark application rejections are based on marks being merely 
descriptive or “likelihood of confusion” of the source of the goods.  
Federal application process based on “use in interstate commerce”:
§1a) actual use in commerce, or 
§1b) bona fide intent-to-use (ITU) in commerce.
Like other forms of IP, trademark registration must exist in a country to be enforceable.

TRADE SECRETS - 18 USC §§ 1830-1839 
A trade secret is any confidential business information which provides an enterprise a competitive edge.
"Trade secret" means:
•
information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, 
technique, or process, that: 
•
(i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally 
known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who 
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and 
•
(ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its 
secrecy.

TRADE SECRETS - 18 USC §§ 1830-1839 
Defend Trade Secrets Act (2016):
•
A United States federal law (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1836) provides a federal CIVIL cause of 
action for trade secret misappropriation and a civil seizure (in extraordinary circumstances).
•
No federal preemption.  State courts still available under common law unfair competition 
and/or Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), if adopted. (E.g., Ohio Revised Code §1333.61-69.)
•
Broader protection than Uniform Trade Secret Act.
•
"Misappropriation" means:
•
(i) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade 
secret was acquired by improper means; or 
•
(ii) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who 
(A) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or (B) at the time of disclosure or 
use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was 
•
(I) derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it; 
•
(II) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or 
•
(III) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its 
secrecy or limit its use; or before a material change of his [or her] position, knew or had reason to 
know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.
•
"Improper means" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a 
breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other means.

05 PATENTS
20
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)
Confidential | December 2018
PATENTS – 35 U.S.C. §§ 101-390
A patent is an exclusive right for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.
Once granted, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to exclude others from 
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the claimed invention for the term of the 
patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date, subject to the payment of maintenance 
fees.
•
A patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention.
•
Patents are territorial, and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in 
force.
•
The granted claims in the specific country are what defines the scope of enforcement.
•
Patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented 
invention without permission from the patent holder. 
•
Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license.
•
Maintenance fees vary from country to country, and when payment is due.
The basic quid pro quo:
Written Description, Enablement, Best Mode = Limited Monopoly 
21
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)

PATENTS – 35 U.S.C. §§ 101-390
Requirements for patenting an invention:
Statutory Subject Matter:  Process, Machine, Manufacture, or Composition of Matter
Written Description/Enablement (35 U.S.C. §112, see also EPC Art. 83)
•
…a written description of the invention, …, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable
any person skilled in the art … to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best 
mode … of carrying out the invention.
Novel and Useful (35 U.S.C. §101/102, see also EPC Art. 54, 57)
•
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or 
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent 
therefor…. 
Non-Obvious (35 U.S.C. §103, see also EPC Art. 56)
•
A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, … if the differences between the 
claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole 
would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a 
person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains. 
22
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)

PATENTS – 35 U.S.C. §§ 101-390
Claims define the metes and bounds of the patentee’s exclusive right.
What defines an invention?
The CLAIMS, not the specification, provide notice of the scope of patent protection.  
•
Neither the specification, which includes the written description of the invention, nor the 
drawings accompanying the specification, can be infringed.
•
Claims must first be construed without reference to an accused product before they can be 
applied, as so construed, to the accused product to determine infringement.  
•
All limitations in a claim must be considered meaningful and cannot be ignored as 
insignificant or immaterial in determining infringement.

TRADE SECRETS VERSUS PATENTS
Patents and trade secrets each have their own inherent advantages and limitations. 
Trade Secrets
Patents
Trade secrets involve no registration costs
Patents may cost tens of thousands of dollars, per 
jurisdiction 
Trade secrets have immediate effect and may last 
indefinitely
Average time to obtain a patent is five years, and a
patent expires up to 20 years* after earliest filing date
Trade secret protection does not require any formalities 
such as disclosure of the information to a Government 
authority.
Inventors must disclose the invention to the public, 
without a guarantee of obtaining a patent*
Some trade secrets are susceptible to reverse 
engineering
Exclusive rights of patents allows protection from any 
type of infringement or copying — whether intentional 
or unintentional.
Once the secret is made public, anyone may have 
access to it and use it at will
Quid pro quo for a limited monopoly to exclude others is 
public disclosure of the invention
A trade secret may be patented by another “inventor”
but prior commercial use defense is available (35 USC 
273) 
Independent invention is no defense against patent 
infringement
A trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent;
must show misappropriation
Patent infringement covers direct and indirect 
infringement

07 INFRINGEMENT
25
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)
Confidential | December 2018
INFRINGEMENT
In general terms, IP infringement is any breach of intellectual property rights.
IP rights are infringed when a work protected by IP laws is used, copied or otherwise 
exploited without having the proper permission from a person who owns those rights.
Examples of an IP infringement are “counterfeiting” and “piracy."
•
Counterfeiting is the practice of imitating genuine goods, often to inferior quality, with the 
intent to take advantage of the superior value of the imitated product.
•
Piracy is an unauthorized copying, use, reproduction and/or distribution of materials 
protected by intellectual property rights.

Step 1:  Claim construction:

Begin with the words of the claim itself.
−
The words of the claim should be given their ordinary and customary meaning.

Review the rest of the patent (specification and drawings).
−
Claims terms are not interpreted in isolation.
 Defined terms
 Intentional disclaimers


−
May consult patent prosecution history and/or extrinsic evidence.
Step 2:  Read the claim(s) onto the accused product/process:
 Assess whether each of the recited elements are present (actually or inherently)in the accused 
product/process.
 Claim charts are useful tools for analyzing and presenting information regarding a patent claim.
PATENT INFRINGEMENT - 35 U.S.C. § 271 
Steps for assessing infringement of a claim
Infringement assessment is an element-by-element comparison of the claim vis-à-vis the accused product/process.

Literal infringement - Statutory
 35 USC §271(a) or (g)
− Accused infringer practices each element of the patent holder’s patent claim - “All elements rule”
− Importation of a good manufactured abroad using a patented process 
− See Also
 Article 64(1) EPC
 Article 25, Industrial Property Law (Mexico)
 Section 106, The Patents Act (India)
Nonliteral infringement – Case law
 Called the “Doctrine of Equivalents” 
− US, CN, JP - “triple identity” or insubstantial differences test … "performs substantially the same function in 
substantially the same way to obtain the same result“ as an element of the patented invention.
− EP – The same function, the same technical effect

Inducement [35 USC §271(b)]
 Inducement requires that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific 
intent to encourage another's infringement.
− The knowledge requirement may be satisfied by either a showing of actual knowledge or willful blindness.
 (1) the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and (2) the defendant must take deliberate 
actions to avoid learning of that fact.
− Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 131 S.Ct. 2060 (2011)
Contributory [35 USC §271(c)]
 Selling or offering to sell a component that is a material part of a patented invention, where the component 
does not have any substantial non-infringing uses.
 Supplier must have knowledge must know "that the combination for which his component was especially 
designed was both patented and infringing.
− Does not encompass sale of a staple article of commerce.
 Customer then proceeds to directly infringe a patent using the supplied material part.
