A. PATENTABILITY STUDY
� Why assessing the patentability of an “innovation”?
� To check if said “innovation” is patentable.
� 2 points need to be studied:
- a) is said innovation a real “invention” ? This means that we need
to check if the innovation of interest is something that can be considered as
an invention or not (meaning excluded from the scope of patentability).
- b) is said innovation patentable, i.e. answers to the patentability
requirements ?

B.Studying the patentability of an invention
� Studying the patentability of an invention means checking in 3 steps that the 3
conditions of patentability are respected:
� Step 1: Novelty / anticipation (US terminology);
� Step 2: Inventive step / non-obviousness;
� Step 3: Industrial application / utility
� In order to do so, it is necessary to have:
� a complete and detailed description of the invention, and;
� the relevant prior art

C.Detailed description of the invention
� In order to do so, it is necessary to have:
� Please describe as detailed as possible the invention:
-
its intrinsic characteristics;
-
the technical effects of the invention. For example, for a new captive, its olfactive
description; for a new device, its utilization; for a process, its advantages in terms of yield
or implementation; for a composition comprising a specific compound, its particular effect
etc.;
-
its advantages compared with the existing prior art;
-
the aimed applications or uses of the invention;
-
add drawings if necessary;
-
for a composition, please indicate each components, their nature and their level of
use (or a range of use). Please indicate also their use/action in said composition.

D.Known prior art (1/2)
� In order to do so, it is necessary to have:
� Please indicate the references of any type of relevant prior art document.
� These searches allow you to check roughly if your invention does not exist already.
� Also, these searches will allow you to have an idea of the technical environment
around said invention.
� You can perform any kind of prior art search using keywords related to your
invention (patent database, patent offices websites, Google, books, publications…).

D.Known prior art (2/2)
� In order to do so, it is necessary to have:
� By prior art or “state of the art”, we mean everything made available to the public
(written or oral description, by use, or in any other way) before the filing date of
the patent application:
� “Public”, means that a disclosure to only one person is novelty destroying (when there is no
confidentiality agreement);
� “Made available”, means that the public must have the capacity to understand the
information, or the product, or when the analysis of the invention allows a specialist to identify
its essential characteristics.
� For a prior art disclosure:
- there is no limitation in time and space;
- there is no limitation concerning the way the disclosure has occurred;

E. Assessing the patentability of an invention (1/5)
� Step 1: studying novelty of an invention (1/2)
� The purpose of the novelty requirement is to prevent the prior art from being patented again.
� In Europe and in the main countries, an invention must be new at the date of filing a
patent application (absolute novelty). An invention shall be considered as "novel" if it
does not form part of the "state of the art“.
� To this end, it is thus necessary to have a complete and detailed description of the
invention of interest and an as possible complete state of the art.
-
Additional prior art searches are asked to our Documentalist, using additional specific
keywords. Indeed, often, new relevant documents are identified.

E. Assessing the patentability of an invention (2/5)
� Step 1: studying novelty of an invention (2/2)
� Each element of the invention, each technical effect identified previously by the inventor(s)
is compared to the disclosure of the prior art document.
� If the invention taken as a whole is not found in one and unique disclosure, clearly and
explicitly, thus said invention is novel.
� In order to be novelty destroying, a prior art disclosure must be:
- complete, meaning that all the elements of an invention must be found completely in said prior art
disclosure;
- sufficient, meaning that said disclosure should allow the man skilled in the art reproducing the
invention;
- certain and sure, regarding its content, its date, its existence;
- taken as such, meaning that the disclosure must not be implicit.
� If the invention is novel (and only if it is the case) it is possible to go to step 2, i.e. studying
the inventiveness of said invention.

E. Assessing the patentability of an invention (3/5)
� Step 2: studying the inventiveness of an invention (1/2)
� The purpose of the inventiveness (or obviousness) requirement is to be sure that with
respect to the prior art, an invention would not be obvious for a person skilled in the art.
� The final purpose of this requirement is to prevent rewarding a third party with an exclusive
right (a patent) for a straightforward modification of the existing prior art.
� Any novel invention must be inventive, i.e. it must:
� Bring a solution to a technical problem
� Not be obvious for the man skilled in the art
� For any invention, and thus for any technical domain, there is a specific man or person
skilled in the art.

E. Assessing the patentability of an invention (4/5)
� Step 2: studying the inventiveness of an invention (2/2)
� For assessing the inventiveness of an invention, each technical effects (as provided
previously by the inventor(s)) is evaluated in view of the closest prior art document.
� A specific approach, which is different depending on the country, is followed. For example, in
Europe, the approach is called “problem-solution approach” and consists mainly in:
-
Identifying the closest prior art;
-
Determining the objective technical problem to be solved by the invention, and;
-
Examining whether or not the claimed solution to said objective technical problem is
obvious for the person skilled in the art.
� If the person skilled in the art would have been prompted to modify the closest prior art in
such a way as to arrive at something falling within the terms of the claims, then the invention
does not involve an inventive step.
� Finally, if the invention is novel and inventive, utility (step 3) can be evaluated.

E. Assessing the patentability of an invention (5/5)
� Step 3: studying the utility of an invention
� An invention must be capable of industrial application (utility), i.e., it is must be made or
used in any type of industry.
- This condition avoid patenting theories.
- Most of the time, there is no utility issue in our technical domain.

F. Results of the patentability study
� After assessing the novelty, inventiveness and utility of an invention, it is possible
to conclude that:
� The invention is novel and inventive. In this case, a patent application can be filed (before
or after having reviewed our freedom to operate) and could be considered, a priori, as
“strong”.
� The invention is novel, but not inventive. In this case, the advice is not to patent. Indeed,
the inventive step (or obviousness) bar is quite high in Europe, in the U.S., or in Japan, and
the risk is to disclose our innovation for “nothing”.
� MANE patents strategy is to file only “strong” (a priori) patent applications for
protecting inventions that will be commercialized.

FREEDOM TO OPERATE STUDY
08.12.2016
A.FREEDOM TO OPERATE STUDY
� Why assessing our freedom to operate (FTO) for an invention/project ?
� To check if a product, process, device, or use is not within the scope of
a third party patent or application, i.e. if we are not infringing any patent
or application.
� What is particularly studied is the claims scope of the relevant patents
and/or applications.

B.Studying the FTO of a particular invention/project
� Studying the FTO of an invention, or for a project means interpreting the claims of
the previously identified relevant patents and/or applications.
� if necessary, the interpretation is made in light of the description of said relevant
patents and/or applications.
� In order to do so, it is necessary to have:
� a brief and a more detailed description of the invention/project;
� a geographical scope and;
� the relevant prior art.

C.Brief and detailed description of the project
� Please describe as detailed as possible the project of interest:
-
its intrinsic characteristics;
-
the technical effects of the invention. For example, for a new captive, its olfactive
description; for a new device, its utilization; for a process, its advantages in terms of yield
or implementation; for a composition comprising a specific compound, its particular effect
etc.;
-
its advantages compared with the existing prior art;
-
the aimed applications or uses of the invention;
-
add drawings if necessary;
-
for a composition, please indicate each components, their nature and their level of
use (or a range of use). Please indicate also their use/action in said composition.

D.Geographical scope
� It is necessary to provide an exact list of countries of interest for the
invention/project. Must be considered:
� the countries where the invention will be produced, or a process implemented and;
� the countries where the invention will be commercialized.
� Indeed, it is important to bear in mind that the patent protection is territorial.
Thus, an invention could be patented (and the patent being in force) in France but
not in Italy for example.

E. Known prior art
� For a FTO study, only the patents and/or patent applications, respectively in
force or pending are considered.
� Thus, when doing your prior art searches, please focus on patents and/or
applications only! These type of prior art searches can be done by the inventor(s)
and/or our Documentalist on patent office databases or Google Patent.
� Please indicate in the FTO study request form, the references of any relevant
patents and/or applications document.

F. Assessing the FTO of an invention/project (1/2)
� Step 1: a complementary prior art search
� Additional prior art searches are asked to our Documentalist in order not to avoid any
relevant patent and/or application which could be relevant. Indeed, the keywords used in the
case of a FTO study are most of the times different from the ones used when performing a
“classic” prior art search.
� Indeed, a patent or application could be relevant while the keywords directed to the
invention/project are not the same.
� Step 2: checking the status of the relevant patents and/or applications
� Only the patents in force, i.e. not abandoned, refused, revoked, and not in the public domain
(i.e. having more than 20 years), and the pending patent applications, i.e. currently under
examination, are taken into account and studied.
� Each status is verified country by country.

F. Assessing the FTO of an invention/project (2/2)
� Step 3: studying the relevant patents and/or applications
� Only the claims are analyzed when assessing a FTO study, always country by country. For
your information, claim 1 of a patent or application always has the larger scope. However, all
independent claims are studied in order to check all the “objects” (product, use, method…)
protected by said patent or application.
� In case of lake of clarity for example, the claims could be interpreted in light of the
description.
� In the case of granted patents, it is often necessary to review the complete examination
history which has conducted the patent application to be granted.
� It is important to keep in mind that a definitive FTO opinion can be given only when
considering granted patents. When the relevant document is a patent application,
only a preliminary FTO opinion can be given. Indeed, the definitive scope of
protection of the claims of a patent application will be known only at the end of the
examination process by the patent office.

G.Results of the FTO study
� After assessing the FTO of an invention/project, one can conclude that:
� The invention/project is free to operate and that no patents and/or patent applications
hamper our right to exploit said invention.
� The invention/project is not free to operate :
-
Because of relevant patent applications. In this case, it could be interesting to monitor
said applications and check regularly if said applications are refused, or abandoned. In
this case, said applications would not be anymore a bar to our FTO.
-
Because of relevant granted patents. In this case, it could be also interesting to monitor
said patents and check regularly if said patents are challenged by third parties (through
an opposition for example), or abandoned. As soon as said patents are no more in force
because of an abandonment, said patents would not be anymore a bar to our FTO.
� MANE FTO policy is to always respect third party patents and patent applications.
It is not useful to say that “said patent or application does not look strong, or novel,
or inventive…” just in order to avoid a negative FTO opinion.
