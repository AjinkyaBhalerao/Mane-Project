context:A patent is an exclusive right for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.
question: What is the fundamental trade-off involved in obtaining a patent?
answer: A patent grants exclusive rights for a limited time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention. This means that while a patent provides the right to exclude others from using, making, selling, or importing the patented invention during the patent's term, it requires a detailed disclosure of the invention to the public.

 U.S. JUDICIAL EXCEPTIONS TO THE FOUR CATEGORIES
−
Does the claimed invention wholly embrace a judicially-recognized exception? 
− Examples
Law of Nature:  “Einstein could not patent his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could Newton have 
patented the law of gravity.” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980).
Natural Phenomena:  “A new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not 
patentable subject matter.” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980).
Abstract Idea:  “Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, 
an inventive application of the principle may be patented. Conversely, the discovery of such a 
phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there is some other inventive concept in its application.”
question: Enumerate the judicially recognized exceptions to patent claims and provide an example for each.
answer: The judicially recognized exceptions are: Law of Nature (example: Einstein's E=mc²), Natural Phenomena (example: a new mineral discovered in the earth), and Abstract Idea (example: inventive application of a well-known phenomenon).

filename: Patents FAQs
context:
question: What is a patent? 
answer: A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. A few exemplary inventions include 1) a new process for making seamless capsules, 2) a new fragrance molecule, or 3) a new composition that blocks bitterness taste of high intensity sweeteners. Patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner’s consent. Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop patent infringement. Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party. 

filename: Patents FAQs
context: 
question: What is patentable? 
answer: An invention must, in general, fulfill the following conditions to be protected by a patent. 1. Industrially applicable (useful): It must be of practical use. 2. New: It must show an element of “novelty”, meaning some new characteristic that is not part of the body of existing knowledge in its particular technical field. That body of existing knowledge is called “prior art”. 3. Inventive (not obvious):  It must show an “inventive step” that is not obvious or routine by a person with average knowledge of the technical field. The subject matter of the invention must also be accepted as “patentable” under the patent laws of a given county. In many countries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods or methods of medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) are not generally patentable. For example abstract ideas (Einstein's equation E=mc2), laws of nature (gravity), or natural occurring phenomena (a chemical found in nature) are not patentable, but specific applications of these things could be patentable. 

filename: Patents FAQs
context: 
question: How long does a patent last? 
answer: Patent rights may last for up to 20 years, IF renewal or maintenance fees are paid in a timely manner. 

filename: Patents FAQs
context:
question: Which countries are covered by a patent? 
answer: Patents are granted by national patent offices or by regional offices that carry out examination work for a group of countries – for example, the European Patent Office (EPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). Under such regional systems, an applicant requests protection for an invention in one or more countries, and each country decides 
whether to offer patent protection within its borders. The WIPO-administered Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides for the filing of a single international patent application that has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries. However, in order to obtain a patent in a PCT member nation, a patent application must be filed and prosecuted in the PCT member nation. 
 
filename: Patents FAQs
context:
question: What is patent infringement? 
answer: Patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license. The definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction, but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention. In many countries, a use is required to be commercial (or to have a commercial purpose) to constitute patent infringement. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. In other words, the terms of the claims inform the public of what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder. Patents are territorial, and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force.
