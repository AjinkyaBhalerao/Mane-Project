PD FLASH 4 - Sanctions under the GDPR


February 28 2020

In 2019, MANE Group completed the implementation of the new GDPR rules. According to CNIL, the data protection supervisory authority for MANE Group, all controls, and the penalties associated with their violation, are now in full force and effect.

The old legislation provided for relatively reduced sanctions and enforcement was infrequent. By refraining until the end of 2018 to sanction non-compliance with GDPR, the CNIL wanted to allow data controllers to gradually understand and assimilate the requirements of the GDPR adopted in 2016.

This transition now complete, the first major sanctions were applied by the CNIL in 2019, starting with the exemplary one of 50 million euros against Google and then of 500,000 euros against the company Futura International and of 400,000 euros against Sergic.

The maximum sanction for the MANE Group is 55 million euros. These sanctions can be made public.

While MAN Group believes the GDPR rules are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and partners, the significant financial penalties and reputational damage which can result from violations should cause each of us to redouble our commitment to compliance.
