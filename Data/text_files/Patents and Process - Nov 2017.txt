PATENT BASICS
A patent is an exclusive right for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.
Patents:
A patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to exclude others from making, using, 
selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention for the term of the patent, which is 
usually 20 years from the filing date, subject to the payment of maintenance fees.
•
A patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention.
•
An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process.
Novel and Useful (35 U.S.C. §101, see also EPC Art. 54, 57)
•
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of 
matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the 
conditions and requirements of this title. 
Non-Obvious (35 U.S.C. §103, see also EPC Art. 56)
•
A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, … if the differences between the claimed 
invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious 
before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to 
which the claimed invention pertains. 
Written Description/Enablement (35 U.S.C. §112, see also EPC Art. 83)
•
…a written description of the invention, …, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person 
skilled in the art … to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode … of carrying out the 
invention.

PATENT ELIGIBLE SUBJECT MATTER
 Is the invention directed to one of the four patent-eligible subject matter categories?
Process (or method) 
− E.g., A method of preparing a rapidly water-soluble hard capsule having a core comprising … (USPN 
7,744,922)
Machine (or device)
− E.g., A removable device for preserving and releasing a product contained in a reservoir having a 
rupturable wall for releasing said product, … (USPN 8,584,839)
Manufacture (or article of manufacture)
− E.g., An article of manufacture useful for adding creamer base to a hot beverage, comprising: … USPN 
7,445,804)
Composition of matter
− E.g., A flavoring composition which comprises from 1-80% by weight of a coolant … (USPN 5,725,865)

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that Congress intended patentable subject matter to 
"include anything under the sun that is made by man,” but acknowledges that there are 
limits or exceptions.  
See Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980).
PATENT BASICS
To be patentable, a claim must be directed to one of the four patent-eligible subject matters.

 U.S. JUDICIAL EXCEPTIONS TO THE FOUR CATEGORIES
−
Does the claimed invention wholly embrace a judicially-recognized exception? 
− Examples
−
Law of Nature:  “Einstein could not patent his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could Newton have 
patented the law of gravity.” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980).
−
Natural Phenomena:  “A new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not 
patentable subject matter.” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980).
−
Abstract Idea:  “Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, 
an inventive application of the principle may be patented. Conversely, the discovery of such a 
phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there is some other inventive concept in its application.” 
Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 594(1978).
PATENT BASICS
To be patentable, a claim directed to one of the judicial exceptions must recite something significantly different.

(1) Field of the Invention: A 
statement of the field of art to which 
the invention pertains. 
(2) A description of the related art 
known to the applicant and 
including, if applicable, references 
to specific related art and problems 
involved in the prior art which are 
solved by the applicant’s invention.
A brief summary of the invention 
indicating its nature and substance, 
which may include a statement of 
the object of the invention, should 
precede the detailed description. 
Such summary should, when set 
forth, be commensurate with the 
invention as claimed and any object 
recited should be that of the 
invention as claimed.
When there are drawings, there shall 
be a brief description of the several 
views of the drawings and the 
detailed description of the invention 
shall refer to the different views by 
specifying the numbers of the 
figures, and to the different parts by 
use of reference letters or numerals 
(preferably the latter).

Heading 1
A detailed description of the 
invention follows the general 
statement of invention and brief 
description of the drawings (if 
applicable).  The detailed 
description must be in such 
particularity as to enable any person 
skilled in the pertinent art or science 
to make and use the invention 
without involving extensive 
experimentation.
Best practice to include examples 
and/or experimental details, as this 
establishes enablement.
Best mode is still a statutory 
requirement in the U.S. 
The specification must conclude with 
a claim particularly pointing out and 
distinctly claiming the invention or 
discovery.
Claims set the metes and bounds 
(i.e., defines the scope) of what the 
inventor believes to be the invention.
More than one claim may be 
presented provided they differ 
substantially from each other.
Words used in the claims must have 
antecedent support in the detailed 
description (specification).
Preamble + transition phrase + 
elements.
The purpose of the abstract is to 
enable the Office and the public 
generally to determine quickly from 
a cursory inspection the nature and 
gist of the technical disclosure.
Generally limited to 150 words or less.

Heading 1
Under United States patent law, a 
provisional application is a legal 
document filed in the USPTO, that 
establishes a filing date, but does not 
mature into an issued patent unless 
the applicant files a regular non-
provisional patent application within 
one year.
Sometimes called “poor man’s 
patent.”
Includes a description, and 
optionally drawing(s) (may be 
required for understanding of the 
invention).  Does not require formal 
patent claims, inventors' oaths or 
declarations, or any information 
disclosure statement (IDS).
In the U.S., a complete non-
provisional patent application 
comprises:
• a specification, 
• claims,
• drawings (if necessary), 
• a formal oath or declaration (must 
be filed before patent issues),
• the prescribed filing fee, search 
fee, examination fee and 
application size fee.
Includes Continuation and Divisional 
patent applications.
Foreign applications (JP, CN, MX, EP) 
are essentially equivalent to US non-
provisionals.
The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) 
provides a unified procedure for 
filing patent applications to protect 
inventions in each of its contracting 
states. A patent application filed 
under the PCT is called an 
international application, or PCT 
application.
A PCT application does not itself 
result in the grant of a patent, since 
there is no such thing as an 
"international patent", and the grant 
of patent is a prerogative of each 
national or regional authority.
A search is performed by an 
International Searching Authority 
(ISA), accompanied by a written 
opinion regarding the patentability 
of the invention.

PATENTING PROCESS: US AND ABROAD
Novelty
A claim is anticipated only if each and every element 
as set forth in the claim is found, either expressly or 
inherently described, in a single prior art reference
before the effective filing date of the claim.
Prior art is information that has been made available to 
the public in any form before the earliest effective filing 
date of the claimed invention.
Additional references may be used to:
(A) Prove the primary reference contains an 
“enabled disclosure;”
(B) Explain the meaning of a term used in the primary 
reference; or
(C) Show that a characteristic not disclosed in the 
reference is inherent.
In the U.S., applicant has a one-year grace period for  
public disclosure by or derived from the applicant.
Obviousness (Inventive Step)
In the U.S. (Graham Factors)
(A) Determining the scope and content of the 
prior art;
(B) Ascertaining the differences between the 
claimed invention and the prior art; and
(C) Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the 
pertinent art.
(D) Consider secondary indicia of non-
obviousness:
-evidence of commercial success, 
-long-felt but unsolved needs, 
-failure of others, and 
-unexpected results.
EU, Japan, CN (Problem-Solution Approach)
(i) determining the "closest prior art",
(ii) establishing the "objective technical problem" 
to be solved, and
(iii) considering whether or not the claimed 
invention, starting from the closest prior art and the 
objective technical problem, would have been 
obvious to the skilled person.

•
If at least one utility is credible, specific, and substantial, a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 101 
should not be made. 
•
Credible Utility:  An assertion is credible unless 
•
(A) the logic underlying the assertion is seriously flawed, or 
•
(B) the facts upon which the assertion is based are inconsistent with the logic underlying the assertion.
•
Specific Utility:  A utility that is specific to the subject matter claimed.
•
Substantial Utility:  A utility that defines a "real world" use.
Europe
•
An invention shall be considered as susceptible of industrial application if it can be made or 
used in any kind of industry, including agriculture.
China
•
An invention for a new use for a known compound requires experimental evidence in the 
description to verify the new use and effects thereof… e.g., qualitative or quantitative data 
of experimental tests that are sufficient to convince a person skilled in the art that the 
anticipated technical effects/use can be achieved.

INVENTORSHIP
21
PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS
Confidential | November 2017
 Conception is the touchstone of inventorship, the completion of the mental part of
the invention.
 The conception of the invention consists in the complete performance of the mental part of the 
inventive act. All that remains to be accomplished in order to perfect the act or instrument belongs to 
the department of construction, not invention. It is, therefore, the formation in the mind of the inventor 
of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter to be 
applied in practice that constitutes an available conception within the meaning of the patent law.
 Conception is complete only when the idea is so clearly defined in the inventor's mind that 
only ordinary skill would be necessary to reduce the invention to practice, without extensive 
research or experimentation.
 The invention may be reduced to practice by the inventor, or it may be reduced to practice by 
someone who is operating under the direction and control of the inventor.
 An inventor need not know that the invention will work for conception to be complete; discovering that 
the invention works is part of the reduction to practice.
 Factors Often Leading Away From a Conclusion of Inventorship
 Contributing an obvious element or general knowledge.
 Merely suggesting a desired result or outcome without providing the means to accomplish the same.
 Following the instructions of the conceivers.
 Merely refining or perfecting another's design or making only superficial changes.
INVENTORSHIP
Inventorship is a legal determination based on conception of the invention, and not on sweat equity.

DUTY OF DISCLOSURE
23
PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS
Confidential | November 2017
 Each individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a duty 
of candor and good faith in dealing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), 
which includes a duty to disclose all information known to be “material to patentability.”
 Each inventor
 Each patent attorney who prepares or prosecutes the application
 Every other person who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application
 Information is deemed “material to patentability” when it is not cumulative to information 
already of record or being made of record in the application, and
 It establishes, by itself or in combination with other information, a prima facie case of unpatentability of 
a claim; or
 It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in:

Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, or

Asserting an argument of patentability.
 In the US, this duty is fulfilled by submission of a proper Information Disclosure Statement (IDS)
 Outside US, the duty of disclosure varies.  But in all cases, a stronger patent is created when 
the most relevant prior art is before the examiner.
DUTY OF DISCLOSURE
It is best to disclose all information that a reasonable examiner may deem material to patentability of our claims.
