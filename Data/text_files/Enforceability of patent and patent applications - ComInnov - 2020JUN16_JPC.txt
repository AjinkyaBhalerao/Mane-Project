OPENING QUESTIONS
All patent rights derive themselves from the national laws where the application for patent was filed.
1. May patent rights of a granted patent be asserted against an alleged 
infringer?
2. May patent rights of a published patent application be asserted against an 
alleged infringer?
YES, unless invalidated or expired!
Maybe, it depends …

GRANTED PATENT RIGHTS
Patent rights depend on the national laws, where the application for patent was filed.
Important facts relating to “patent rights”:
1)
Scope of patent right is defined by the claims.
2)
Patent rights are Territorial/Geographical.
3)
Patent rights protect against direct and indirect infringement.
4)
Granted Patents are presumed valid (rebuttable).
5)
Granted patent ≠ right to practice.
6)
Granted patents typically last only 20 years from the earliest filing date, 
a few countries provide patent term extension for governmental delays.

GRANTED PATENT RIGHTS
Infringement is an unauthorized activity of someone else’s exclusive right.  
IP rights are infringed when a work protected by IP laws is used, copied, or 
otherwise exploited without having the proper permission from the owner of those 
rights.
In the context of patent rights, the patent owner or licensee has the exclusive right 
for: 
making or using
selling
offering for sale
importing
… the claimed invention.

GRANTED PATENT RIGHTS
Infringement of a patent rights is governed by national laws.
EPC Article 64 - Rights Conferred by a European Patent
(1)  A European patent shall confer on its proprietor from the date on which the mention 
of its grant is published in the European Patent Bulletin, in each Contracting State in 
respect of which it is granted, the same rights as would be conferred by a 
national patent granted in that State.
(2)  If the subject-matter of the European patent is a process, the protection conferred by 
the patent shall extend to the products directly obtained by such process.
(3)  Any infringement of a European patent shall be dealt with by national law.

“PROVISIONAL” PATENT RIGHTS
“Provisional” rights in patent applications attach as early as when it is published.
EPC Article 67 - Rights conferred by a European patent application after 
publication
A European patent application shall, from the date of its publication, provisionally confer upon the 
applicant the protection provided for [granted patents], in the Contracting States designated in the 
application.
…. each State shall ensure at least that, from the date of publication of a European patent 
application, the applicant can claim compensation reasonable in the circumstances from any person 
who has used the invention in that State in circumstances where that person would be liable under 
national law for infringement of a national patent.
The European patent application shall be deemed never to have had the effects set out in 
paragraphs 1 and 2 when it has been withdrawn, deemed to be withdrawn or finally refused.

35 USC §154
A patent shall include the right to 
obtain a reasonable royalty from any 
person who, during the period 
beginning on the date of publication of 
the and ending on the date the patent is 
issued—
* makes, uses, offers for sale, or sells in 
the United States the invention as 
claimed in the published patent 
application or imports such an invention 
into the United States; or
* uses, offers for sale, or sells in the 
United States or imports into the United 
States products made by the process as 
claimed in the published patent 
application; and
*  has actual notice of the published 
patent application.
The invention as claimed in the patent is 
substantially identical to the 
invention as claimed in the published 
patent application.
Patent Act, Article 65
Provisional patent protection is available 
based on a published application. 
A notice letter may be sent to potential 
infringers demanding compensation for 
the unauthorized exploitation of a 
claimed invention, as published, which is 
enforceable after issuance of a 
patent. 
In certain situations, an expedited 
publication procedure should be used as 
a means for an early notice letter to 
potential infringers. Such an approach 
can serve to enhance damage awards 
and/or bring potential infringers to the 
negotiating table.

If an appropriate royalty is not paid for
using an invention during the period
from the publication of the invention
patent application to the grant of the
patent right, the period of limitation for
taking legal action by the patentee for
requesting payment of royalties shall be

FTO STUDIES – DEFINING RISKS
In order to minimize unknown risks, we need to search and find the problem patent documents.
MANE policy is to respect valid, third party patents and patent applications.
So, how do we as a company evaluate or define our risk for patent infringement liability?  
By becoming intimately familiar with the relevant patent landscape.
Types of patent searches:
•
Patent Landscape
•
A state-of-the-art search for the relevant technology.
•
Typically performed at the genesis of an innovation project.
•
Advantageous to spot problem patent documents early on.
•
Freedom to Operate
•
Targeted/focused search of pending patent documents relating to the intended commercial 
embodiment(s).
•
Typically performed near the end of project before commercialization.

FTO STUDIES – DEFINING RISKS
FTO search results allows us to understand our risk for commercialization of a project.
MANE policy is to respect valid, third party patents and patent applications.
1. Patent counsel develops search strategy and runs the search to identify patent documents 
relevant to MANE’s propose activity.
2.  The claims of the patent documents are analyzed vis-à-vis MANE’s proposed activity.  
3.  Status of any relevant patent documents are assessed (abandoned, fees paid, etc.).
4.  A written opinion providing FTO guidance is rendered:
 Best Case - Said proposed activity is free to exploit (with/out restrictions).
 If enforceable patents or pending patent applications block MANE’s proposed activity:
 Option 1 - Work with R&D to develop design around strategies, if possible.
 Option 2 - Commercialize in alternative countries; and monitor problematic patent documents 
for abandonment, invalidation, expiration, etc.
 Option 3 – Assess validity

FTO STUDIES – MITIGATING RISKS
Invalidity actions require a team to find, analyse, and present the prior art in a convincing manner.
MANE policy is to respect valid, third party patents and patent applications.
Option 3 - Assess validity of problematic patent documents.
•
Goal – Establish or discover clear lack of novelty for each claim of concern.
•
Often requires collaboration between R&D, Didier Geraud, and Patent Counsel to find novelty-
destroying prior art.
•
Careful analysis of novelty-destroying reference(s) and said patent document must be performed to 
foresee probable/likely amendments that applicant could make to reestablish claim novelty.
•
Present facts and analysis to Senior VMF Management with potential options for “invalidation.”
•


Where possible, seek permission to submit Third Party Observations (good global citizen).

Propose options for commercializing without disclosing to Patent Application Owner (good business).
•

Where possible, anonymously initiate validity challenge (e.g., Substantial New Question of Patentability – US).

Novelty destroying reference forced applicant to amend claims toward excluding our proposed formulation.
US20070148283 – abandoned patent application, discloses Composition A
•
Cooling Composition A anticipates broad independent claim of WO2017079506A1
•
WO2017079506A1 only discloses an isopulegol content of 25 wt% to 75 wt%.
•
MANE’s proposed cooling composition only has 20 wt% (MAX) isopulegol.
•
Permission granted from MANE management to submit Third Party Observations in EP and US files
•
Rejection over Comp A induced adding an amendment reciting isopulegol at 25 wt% to 75 wt%.  
•
Thus MANE’s composition is outside scope of these amended.   
•
Additional applications are  pending in Australia, Canada, China, and Russia … so we will continue 
to monitor.

CLOSING REMARKS - QUESTIONS
Best option (from risk perspective) is to avoid infringement (literally or Doctrine of Equivalents).
Key Take-A-Ways
1. MANE respects valid, third party patents and patent applications.
2. Best option for problematic patents and/or patent applications is to avoid infringement.
a. Design around?
b. Commercialize where patent protection is not?
c. Wait … wait … wait …?
3. If options in point 2 are not possible/reasonable/practical …
a. Invalidity (novely-destroying) Investigation … but this requires extra effort from 
TEAMS to collaborate, find the “right” prior art, and propose low risk solutions to 
MANE Senior Management.
b. If you can’t beat them, buy/license them????
