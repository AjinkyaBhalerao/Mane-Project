PD Flash 13 - Involvement of HR and IT departments in compliance with the GDPR
Dear all,
HR and IT departments are those who, more than any other in a company, collect, store and process personal data and must secure it. 
It is up to companies to prove that these two services have brought their operating processes into compliance with the GDPR. Indeed, they must be constantly involved in discussions around the protection of personal data.
Regarding the HR department, it may have to respond to any employeeâ€™s assertion of his right of access, rectification or deletion of his personal data. The HR department must therefore ensure that it knows where this information is stored and be able to gather it quickly in order to respond to any requests from employees. 
It implies that the HR department knows exactly where all the personal data are held, optimizes its systems to better manage this information, but also are able to prove to employees that their requests regarding their data have been processed. In order to achieve this, it must consider all of the information generated by an employee, from his job interview to his effective departure from the company. Recruitment, medical information, wage payments and travel information are particularly sensitive.

The IT department on the other hand is responsible for ensuring the security of the personal data that the company processes and holds. It must guarantee the integrity of the data provenance by minimizing the risk of data loss or hacking. The measures to be taken, whether digital or physical, depend on the sensitivity of the data processed and the risks to which people are exposed in the event of an incident. The flaws can have serious consequences for those who have entrusted personal data, in the event of loss, disclosure or unwanted modification of their data. IT department must be able to detect them quickly and resolve the incident as quickly as possible.
