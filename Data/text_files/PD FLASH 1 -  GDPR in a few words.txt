PD FLASH -  GDPR in a few words
February 4 2020

The general data protection regulation, better known as GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016), governs the processing of personal data notably throughout the territory of the European Union since May 25, 2018.

In practice, we must be able to demonstrate to the supervisory authorities the compliance of MANE Group to the GDPR when employees have to process personal data.

As such, you have a key role as DP Coordinator within the meaning of the MANE Group Code of Conduct for Personal Data (English version attached).

This is the reason why, you will regularly receive summary information as a reminder via "PD FLASH " emails, to complete the initial training provided to all of the MANE Group DP Coordinators.

DP Coordinators who have not attended one of our training sessions since 2018 will be invited in the coming days to new sessions which will take place during the month of February.

We also resend you attached, Mane procedures applicable to the protection of personal data in their English versions.
