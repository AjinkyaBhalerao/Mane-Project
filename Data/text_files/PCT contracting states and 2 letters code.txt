Where a State can be designated for a regional patent, the two-letter code for the regional patent concerned is indicated in parenthe-
ses (AP = ARIPO patent, EA = Eurasian patent, EP = European patent, OA = OAPI patent).
Important:  This list includes all States that have adhered to the PCT by the date shown in the heading. Any State indicated in bold
italics has adhered to the PCT but will only become bound by the PCT on the date shown in parentheses; it will not be considered to
have been designated in international applications filed before that date.
Note that even though the filing of a request constitutes under PCT Rule 4.9(a) the designation of all Contracting States bound by the
PCT on the international filing date, for the grant of every kind of protection available and, where applicable, for the grant of both regional
and national patents, applicants should always use the latest versions of the request form (PCT/RO/101) and demand form
(PCT/IPEA/401)(the latest versions are dated January 2010 and July 2011, respectively) or, if filing the request using the PCT-EASY
features of the PCT-SAFE software, the latest version of that software (which is available at: http://www.wipo.int/pct-safe/en/). The
request and demand forms can be printed from the website, in editable PDF format, at: http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/forms/, or obtained
from receiving Offices or the International Bureau, or, in the case of the demand form, also from International Preliminary Examining Authorities.
