FOREWORD TO THE 2016 EDITION 
  
In presenting this fourth edition of the UNIDROIT Principles of 
International Commercial Contracts, we would like first of all to 
express our deepest appreciation to the Members of the Working Group, 
in particular to the Rapporteurs responsible for the various topics that 
were addressed in this revision to take better into account the special 
needs of long-term contracts. We also wish to express our gratitude to 
the Observers who participated in the sessions of the Working Group in 
representation of important international organisations and other 
interested institutions and arbitration associations. It was only on 
account of the outstanding competence and extraordinary efforts of all 
those experts, again so ably coordinated by Mr Michael Joachim 
Bonell, that this new edition of the UNIDROIT Principles was made 
possible. 
We must again recognise all those who, through scholarly writings 
or by applying the UNIDROIT Principles in practice, have contributed to 
the great success of the Principles. Such writings and practical 
experience have greatly assisted the Working Group in their 
deliberations. We hope that this support of the Principles and sharing of 
experiences will continue in the future. 
A special word of thanks goes to Mr Neale Bergman and Ms Lena 
Peters of the UNIDROIT Secretariat, who served as Secretaries to the 
Working Group and undertook the important task of editing the 
additions and amendments. 
Our gratitude also goes to the other members of the Secretariat, in 
particular Ms Frédérique Mestre for preparing the French language 
version of the Principles in co-operation with Mr Marcel Fontaine and 
Ms Isabelle Dubois for her formatting work of the new edition.   
Last but by no means least, we would like to express our deepest 
appreciation to the Max-Planck-Institut für ausländisches und 
internationales Privatrecht and its Director Reinhard Zimmermann for 
generously hosting the second meeting of the Working Group in 
Hamburg.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 2016 EDITION 
 
When approving previous editions of the UNIDROIT 
Principles of International Commercial Contracts, the Governing 
Council emphasised the need for the Secretariat to monitor the use 
of the Principles in actual practice and to inquire with the 
international legal and business communities whether new topics 
should be considered for inclusion in future editions. Consistent 
with this instruction, following the adoption of the Model Clauses 
for the Use of the UNIDROIT Principles of International 
Commercial Contracts in 2013, the Secretariat drew the 
Governing Council’s attention to long-term contracts and the 
possibility of future work on the Principles in this area. 
The 2016 edition of the UNIDROIT Principles is not intended as a 
revision of the previous editions. As amply demonstrated by the 
extensive body of case law and bibliographic references on the 
UNILEX database <www.unilex.info>, the UNIDROIT Principles 
continue to be well received generally and have not given rise in 
practice to any significant difficulties of application.  
The main objective of the fourth edition of the UNIDROIT 
Principles is to take better into account the special needs of long-
term contracts. To do so, the content of the 2010 edition has been 
altered only marginally: only six provisions have been amended, 
i.e. the Preamble and Articles 1.11, 2.1.14, 5.1.7, 5.1.8, and 7.3.7. 
Indeed, the majority of alterations were made to the Comments, in 
particular on the Preamble (amendments to Comment 2) and 
Articles 1.11 (addition of a new Comment 3), 2.1.14 (amendments 
to Comments 1-3 and addition of a new Comment 4), 2.1.15 
(amendments to Comment 2 and addition of a new Comment 3), 
4.3 (amendments to Comment 3 (which has become Comment 4) 
and addition of a new Comment 3), 4.8 (amendments to Comments 
1-3), 5.1.3 (amendments to the Comment (which has become 
Comment 1) and addition of a new Comment 2), 5.1.4 (addition of 
a new Comment 3), 5.1.7 (amendments to Comments 2-3), 5.1.8 
(amendments to the Comment (which has become Comment 1) and 
addition of a new Comment 2), 7.1.7 (addition of a new Comment 
5), 7.3.5 (amendments to Comment 3 and addition of a new 
Comment 4), 7.3.6 (amendments to Comment 1), and 7.3.7 
(amendments to Comments 1-2).  
UNIDROIT Principles 
viii 
As a result, the 2016 edition of the UNIDROIT Principles, like 
the 2010 edition, consists of 211 Articles (as opposed to the 120 
Articles of the 1994 edition and the 185 Articles of the 2004 
edition). For ease of comparison a table of correspondence of the 
articles of the four editions of the UNIDROIT Principles has been 
included in this volume. 
In presenting the first edition of the UNIDROIT Principles the 
Governing Council expressed its confidence that the international 
legal and business communities to which the Principles were 
addressed would appreciate their merits and benefit from their 
use. The success of the previous editions has not fallen short of 
the Governing Council’s expectations. It is hoped that by better 
addressing the needs of long-term contracts the 2016 edition of 
the UNIDROIT Principles will be as favourably received as the 
previous editions and result in the Principles becoming even better 
known and more widely used throughout the world.

FOREWORD TO THE 2010 EDITION 
  
In presenting this third edition of the UNIDROIT Principles of 
International Commercial Contracts, we would like to begin by 
expressing our deepest appreciation to the Members of the Working 
Group, and in particular to the Rapporteurs on the new chapters. We 
also wish to express our gratitude to the numerous Observers who 
attended the sessions of the Working Group in representation of 
important international organisations and other interested institutions 
and arbitration associations. It was only on account of the outstanding 
competence and extraordinary efforts of all those experts, again so ably 
coordinated by Michael Joachim Bonell, that this new edition of the 
UNIDROIT Principles was made possible. 
We would again also like to thank those who, through scholarly 
writings or by applying the UNIDROIT Principles in practice, have 
contributed to the great success of the Principles. The comments they 
made and their practical experience have been an inestimable source of 
inspiration to the Working Group, and we hope they will continue to 
share with us in the future their experience with the Principles. 
A special word of thanks goes to Henry Gabriel who, together with 
Michael Joachim Bonell and Ms Lena Peters of the UNIDROIT 
Secretariat, undertook the important task of editing the new chapters 
and harmonising style and language throughout the entire volume.       
Our gratitude also goes to the other members of the Secretariat, in 
particular Ms Paula Howarth, Secretary to the Working Group, and Ms 
Frédérique Mestre and Ms Marina Schneider for preparing the French 
language version of the Principles in co-operation with the francophone 
Members of the Working Group.   
Last but by no means least, we would like to express our deepest 
appreciation to the Max-Planck-Institut für ausländisches und 
internationales Privatrecht (Hamburg) and its Director Reinhard 
Zimmermann for the generous financial and logistic support provided.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 2010 EDITION 
 
When it approved the 2004 edition of the UNIDROIT 
Principles of International Commercial Contracts the Governing 
Council recalled that the Principles were one of the Institute’s 
most successful projects and recommended that they figure in the 
Work Programme as an ongoing project. To this effect it 
instructed the Secretariat not only to continue to monitor the use 
of the Principles in actual practice but also to undertake at an 
appropriate time an inquiry among the international legal and 
business communities to determine new topics for inclusion in a 
future third edition of the Principles. 
The new, 2010 edition of the UNIDROIT Principles, like the 2004 
edition, is not intended as a revision of the previous editions. As 
amply demonstrated by the extensive body of case law and 
bibliography 
reported 
in 
the 
UNILEX 
database 
<www.unilex.info>, the UNIDROIT Principles continue to be well 
received generally and have not given rise in practice to any 
significant difficulties of application. Consequently, the content of 
the 2004 edition has been altered only marginally: only five 
provisions have been amended, i.e. Articles 3.1 (now  3.1.1), 3.19 
(now 3.1.4), paragraph 2 of Article 3.17 (now 3.2.15), paragraph 1 
of Article 7.3.6 (now 7.3.6) and paragraph 2 of Article 7.3.6 (now 
7.3.7), and of these only the last three have been amended in 
substance so as to justify their transformation into separate articles; 
as to the Comments, significant changes have been made only with 
respect to Comments 2, 3 and 4 to Article 1.4.   
The main objective of the third edition of the UNIDROIT 
Principles was to address additional topics of interest to the 
international business and legal communities. Thus 26 new 
articles have been added dealing with restitution in case of failed 
contracts, illegality, conditions, plurality of obligors and of 
obligees.   
As a result, the 2010 edition of the UNIDROIT Principles 
consists of 211 Articles (as opposed to the 120 Articles of the 
1994 edition and the 185 Articles of the 2004 edition) structured 
as follows: Preamble (unchanged); Chapter 1: General provisions 
(unchanged); Chapter 2, Section 1: Formation (unchanged), 
Section 2: Authority of agents (unchanged); Chapter 3, Section 1: 
Introduction (2010) 
xv 
 
General provisions (containing former Articles 3.1 (amended), 
3.2, 3.3 and 3.19 (amended)), Section 2: Ground for avoidance 
(containing former Articles 3.4 to 3.16, 3.17 (amended), 3.18 and 
3.20, and a new Article 3.2.15), Section 3: Illegality (new); 
Chapter 4: Interpretation (unchanged); Chapter 5, Section 1: 
Content (unchanged), Section 2: Third Party Rights (unchanged), 
Section 3: Conditions (new); Chapter 6, Section 1: Performance in 
general (unchanged), Section 2: Hardship (unchanged); Chapter 7, 
Section 1: Non-performance in general (unchanged), Section 2: 
Right to performance (unchanged), Section 3: Termination 
(containing former Articles 7.3.1 to 7.3.5, 7.3.6 (amended) and a 
new Article 7.3.7), Section 4: Damages (unchanged); Chapter 8: 
Set-off (unchanged); Chapter 9, Section 1: Assignment of rights 
(unchanged), Section 2: Transfer of obligations (unchanged), 
Section 3: Assignment of contracts (unchanged); Chapter 10: 
Limitation periods (unchanged); Chapter 11, Section 1: Plurality 
of obligors (new), Section 2: Plurality of obligees (new). For ease 
of comparison a table of correspondence of the articles of the 
three editions of the UNIDROIT Principles has been included in this 
volume. 
In presenting the first edition of the UNIDROIT Principles the 
Governing Council expressed its confidence that the international 
legal and business communities to which the Principles were 
addressed would appreciate their merits and benefit from their 
use. The success of the second edition did not fall short of the 
Governing Council’s expectations. It is hoped that the 2010 
edition of the UNIDROIT Principles will be as favourably received 
as the previous editions and become even better known and more 
widely used throughout the world.

FOREWORD TO THE 2004 EDITION 
  
It is with the utmost pleasure that we present this new edition of the 
UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts which 
comes exactly ten years after the appearance of the first edition.  
We would like first of all to express the Institute’s deepest 
appreciation and gratitude to the Members of the Working Group and 
observers for their achievement and, among them, especially to the 
Rapporteurs on the various chapters. It was only on account of their 
outstanding competence and extraordinary efforts, again so proficiently 
coordinated by Michael Joachim Bonell, that this new edition was made 
possible. 
We would also like to thank all those who have, over the last years, 
through their scholarly writings on the UNIDROIT Principles or by 
applying them in practice contributed to their great success. Their 
comments and practical experience have been an inestimable source of 
inspiration to the Working Group in its deliberations. It is our hope that 
they will continue their support and will also share with us in the future 
their experience with the UNIDROIT Principles. 
Last but by no means least, our gratitude also goes to the UNIDROIT 
Secretariat, in particular to Ms Paula Howarth and Ms Lena Peters for 
their invaluable editorial assistance and to Ms Marina Schneider for 
her efficiency in looking after the French version in co-operation with 
the francophone Members of the Working Group.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 2004 EDITION 
 
 
When the Governing Council decided in 1994 to publish the 
UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, it stressed 
the need to monitor their use with a view to their possible 
reconsideration at some time in the future. Three years later work was 
resumed with a view to preparing a second edition of the UNIDROIT 
Principles. To this end, a Working Group was set up composed of 
eminent jurists representing the major legal systems and/or regions of 
the world. Some of its members had already participated in the 
preparation of the 1994 edition of the UNIDROIT Principles, while for 
the first time representatives of interested international organisations 
and arbitration centres or associations were invited to attend the 
Working Group’s sessions as observers.  
The new edition of the UNIDROIT Principles, appearing ten years 
after the first edition, is not intended as a revision of the 1994 edition. 
As is amply demonstrated by the extensive body of case law and 
bibliography reported in the UNILEX database <www.unilex.info>, the 
UNIDROIT Principles have generally met with approval and have not 
given rise in practice to any significant difficulties of application. 
Consequently, only very few amendments of substance were made to 
the 1994 text and these were moreover limited, with one exception, to 
the comments. Indeed, the only black-letter rule amended was Article 
2.8(2) which has now become Article 1.12. As to the comments, 
Comment 3 to Article 1.3, Comments 1 and 2 to Article 1.7, Comment 2 
to Article 2.15 (now 2.1.15) and Comment 2 to Article 6.2.2 were 
substantially revised or expanded. 
However, it was decided to consider whether and, if so, to what 
extent the 1994 edition of the UNIDROIT Principles required additions or 
amendments to adapt it to the increasingly important practice of 
electronic contracting. Eventually, only a few changes were made to this 
effect to the black letter rules (see Article 1.2, Article 2.8(1) (now 
2.1.8), Article 2.18 (now 2.1.18)), while more changes were made to the 
comments and illustrations (see Comment 1 to Article 1.2, Comments 1 
and 4 to Article 1.9 (now 1.10) and Illustrations, Comment 3 to Article 
2.1 (now 2.1.1) and Illustration, Comment to Article 2.7 (now 2.1.7) and 
Illustration, Comment to Article 2.8 (now 2.1.8)).  
Introduction (2004) 
 
xxiii 
The main purpose of the new edition of the UNIDROIT Principles 
is to cover additional topics of interest to the international legal and 
business communities. Thus, five new chapters were prepared dealing 
with authority of agents, third party rights, set-off, assignment of rights, 
transfer of obligations and assignment of contracts, and limitation 
periods. Furthermore, two new articles were included in Chapter 1 and 
Chapter 5, respectively dealing with inconsistent behaviour (Article 1.8) 
and release by agreement (Article 5.1.9). 
As a result, the 2004 edition of the UNIDROIT Principles consists 
of 185 articles (as opposed to the 120 Articles of the 1994 edition) 
structured as follows: Preamble (1994 version, with the addition of 
paragraphs 4 and 6 as well as the footnote); Chapter 1: General 
Provisions (1994 version, with the addition of Articles 1.8 and 1.12);

success in practice of the UNIDROIT Principles over the last ten years 
has surpassed the most optimistic expectations. It is hoped that the 2004 
edition of the UNIDROIT Principles will be just as favourably received 
by legislators, business persons, lawyers, arbitrators and judges and 
become even better known and more widely used throughout the world.

FOREWORD TO THE 1994 EDITION 
  
It is with the utmost pleasure that the International Institute for the 
Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) announces the completion of the 
drawing up of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial 
Contracts. This achievement represents the outcome of many years of 
intensive research and deliberations involving the participation of a 
large number of eminent lawyers from all five continents of the world. 
Tribute must first be paid to the members of the Working Group 
primarily entrusted with the preparation of the UNIDROIT Principles 
and, among them, especially to the Rapporteurs for the different 
chapters. Without their personal commitment and unstinting efforts, so 
ably coordinated throughout by Michael Joachim Bonell, this ambitious 
project could not have been brought to its successful conclusion. 
We must also express gratitude for the most valuable input given by 
the numerous practising lawyers, judges, civil servants and academics 
from widely differing legal cultures and professional backgrounds, who 
became involved in the project at various stages of the drafting process 
and whose constructive criticism was of the greatest assistance. 
In this moment of great satisfaction for the Institute we cannot but 
evoke the memory of Mario Matteucci, who for so many years served 
UNIDROIT as Secretary-General and then as President and whose belief 
in the Principles as a vital contribution to the process of international 
unification of law was a source of constant inspiration to us all.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 1994 EDITION 
 
 
Efforts towards the international unification of law have hitherto 
essentially taken the form of binding instruments, such as supranational 
legislation or international conventions, or of model laws. Since these 
instruments often risk remaining little more than a dead letter and tend 
to be rather fragmentary in character, calls are increasingly being made 
for recourse to non-legislative means of unification or harmonisation of 
law. 
Some of those calls are for the further development of what is termed 
“international commercial custom”, for example through model clauses 
and contracts formulated by the interested business circles on the basis 
of current trade practices and relating to specific types of transactions or 
particular aspects thereof. 
Others go even further and advocate the elaboration of an 
international restatement of general principles of contract law.  
UNIDROIT’s initiative for the elaboration of “Principles of 
International Commercial Contracts” goes in that direction. 
It was as long ago as 1971 that the Governing Council decided to 
include this subject in the Work Programme of the Institute. A small 
Steering Committee, composed of Professors René David, Clive M. 
Schmitthoff and Tudor Popescu, representing the civil law, the common 
law and the socialist systems, was set up with the task of conducting 
preliminary inquiries into the feasibility of such a project. 
It was not until 1980, however, that a special Working Group was 
constituted for the purpose of preparing the various draft chapters of the 
Principles. The Group, which included representatives of all the major 
legal systems of the world, was composed of leading experts in the field 
of contract law and international trade law. Most of them were 
academics, some high ranking judges or civil servants, who all sat in a 
personal capacity. 
The Group appointed from among its members Rapporteurs for the 
different chapters of the UNIDROIT Principles, who were entrusted with 
the task of submitting successive drafts together with Comments. These 
were then discussed by the Group and circulated to a wide range of 
experts, including UNIDROIT’s extensive network of correspondents. In 
addition, the Governing Council offered its advice on the policy to be 
followed, especially in those cases where the Group had found it 
difficult to reach a consensus. The necessary editorial work was 
entrusted to an Editorial Committee, assisted by the Secretariat. 
Introduction (1994) 
 
xxix 
For the most part the UNIDROIT Principles reflect concepts to be 
found in many, if not all, legal systems. Since however the UNIDROIT 
Principles are intended to provide a system of rules especially tailored to 
the needs of international commercial transactions, they also embody 
what are perceived to be the best solutions, even if still not yet generally 
adopted. 
The objective of the UNIDROIT Principles is to establish a balanced 
set of rules designed for use throughout the world irrespective of the 
legal traditions and the economic and political conditions of the 
countries in which they are to be applied. This goal is reflected both in 
their formal presentation and in the general policy underlying them. 
As to their formal presentation, the UNIDROIT Principles deliberately 
seek to avoid the use of terminology peculiar to any given legal system. 
The international character of the UNIDROIT Principles is also stressed 
by the fact that the comments accompanying each single provision 
systematically refrain from referring to national laws in order to explain 
the origin and rationale of the solution retained. Only where the rule has 
been taken over more or less literally from the world wide accepted 
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods (CISG) is explicit reference made to its source. 
With regard to substance, the UNIDROIT Principles are sufficiently 
flexible to take account of the constantly changing circumstances 
brought about by the technological and economic developments 
affecting cross-border trade practice. At the same time they attempt to 
ensure fairness in international commercial relations by expressly 
stating the general duty of the parties to act in accordance with good 
faith and fair dealing and, in a number of specific instances, imposing 
standards of reasonable behaviour. 
Naturally, to the extent that the UNIDROIT Principles address issues 
also covered by CISG, they follow the solutions found in that 
Convention, with such adaptations as were considered appropriate to 
reflect the particular nature and scope of the Principles (*). 
In offering the UNIDROIT Principles to the international legal and 
business communities, the Governing Council is fully conscious of the 
fact that the UNIDROIT Principles, which do not involve the endorsement 
of Governments, are not a binding instrument and that in consequence 
their acceptance will depend upon their persuasive authority. There are a 
number of significant ways in which the UNIDROIT Principles may 
                                                 
(*) 
See especially Arts. 1.8, 1.9, 2.2, in conjunction with Arts. 5.7 and 7.2.2. 
UNIDROIT Principles  
xxx 
find practical application, the most important of which are amply 
explained in the Preamble. 
The Governing Council is confident that those to whom the 
UNIDROIT Principles are addressed will appreciate their intrinsic merits 
and derive full advantage from their use.

PREAMBLE 
(Purpose of the Principles) 
These Principles set forth general rules for 
international commercial contracts. 
They shall be applied when the parties have 
agreed that their contract be governed by them.(*)  
They may be applied when the parties have 
agreed that their contract be governed by general 
principles of law, the lex mercatoria or the like. 
They may be applied when the parties have 
not chosen any law to govern their contract. 
They may be used to interpret or supple-
ment international uniform law instruments. 
They may be used to interpret or supple-
ment domestic law. 
They may serve as a model for national and 
international legislators. 
COMMENT 
The Principles set forth general rules which are basically conceived 
for “international commercial contracts”. 
1. “International” contracts 
The international character of a contract may be defined in a great 
variety of ways. The solutions adopted in both national and international 
legislation range from a reference to the place of business or habitual 
residence of the parties in different countries to the adoption of more 
general criteria such as the contract having “significant connections with 
more than one State”, “involving a choice between the laws of different 
States”, or “affecting the interests of international trade”. 
The Principles do not expressly lay down any of these criteria. The 
assumption, however, is that the concept of “international” contracts 
                         
(*) 
Parties wishing to provide that their agreement be governed by the 
Principles might use one of the Model Clauses for the Use of the UNIDROIT Principles of 
International Commercial Contracts (see www.unidroit.org/instruments/commercial-
contracts/upicc-model-clauses).  
 
UNIDROIT Principles 
2 
should be given the broadest possible interpretation, so as ultimately to 
exclude only those situations where no international element at all is 
involved, i.e. where all the relevant elements of the contract in question 
are connected with one country only.  
2. “Commercial” contracts  
The restriction to “commercial” contracts is in no way intended to 
take over the distinction traditionally made in some legal systems 
between “civil” and “commercial” parties and/or transactions, i.e. to 
make the application of the Principles dependent on whether the parties 
have the formal status of “merchants” (commerçants, Kaufleute) and/or 
the transaction is commercial in nature. The idea is rather that of 
excluding from the scope of the Principles so-called “consumer 
transactions” which, within the various legal systems, are increasingly 
being subjected to special rules, mostly of a mandatory character, aimed 
at protecting the consumer, i.e. a party who enters into the contract 
otherwise than in the course of its trade or profession. 
The Principles were originally conceived mainly for ordinary 
exchange contracts such as sales contracts to be performed at one time. 
In view of the increasing importance of more complex transactions – in 
particular long-term contracts – the Principles have subsequently been 
adapted to take into account also the characteristics and needs of these 
transactions. For a definition of the notion of “long-term contract”, see 
Article 1.11. 
3. The Principles and domestic contracts between private persons 
 
Notwithstanding the fact that the Principles are conceived for 
international commercial contracts, there is nothing to prevent private 
persons from agreeing to apply the Principles to a purely domestic 
contract. Any such agreement would however be subject to the 
mandatory rules of the domestic law governing the contract. 
4. The Principles as rules of law governing the contract 
 
 
a.  Express choice by the parties 
 
As the Principles represent a system of principles and rules of 
contract law which are common to existing national legal systems or 
best adapted to the special requirements of international commercial 
transactions, there might be good reasons for the parties to choose them 
expressly as the rules of law governing their contract. In so doing the 
parties may refer to the Principles exclusively or in conjunction with a 
Preamble 
 
3 
particular domestic law which should apply to issues not covered by the 
Principles (see the reference to the Model Clauses in the footnote to the 
second paragraph of the Preamble). 
Parties who wish to choose the Principles as the rules of law 
governing their contract are well advised to combine such a choice of 
law clause with an arbitration agreement. 
The reason for this is that the freedom of choice of the parties in 
designating the law governing their contract is traditionally limited to 
national laws (but see now Article 3 of the 2015 Hague Conference on 
Private International Law’s Principles on Choice of Law in 
International Commercial Contracts, subject to certain limitations). 
Therefore, a reference by the parties to the Principles will normally be 
considered to be a mere agreement to incorporate them in the contract, 
while the law governing the contract will still have to be determined on 
the basis of the private international law rules of the forum. As a result, 
the Principles will bind the parties only to the extent that they do not 
affect the rules of the applicable law from which the parties may not 
derogate (see Comment 3 on Article 1.4). 
The situation is different if the parties agree to submit disputes 
arising from their contract to arbitration. Arbitrators are not necessarily 
bound by a particular domestic law. This is self-evident if they are 
authorised by the parties to act as amiable compositeurs or ex aequo et 
bono. But even in the absence of such an authorisation parties are 
generally permitted to choose “rules of law” other than national laws on 
which the arbitrators are to base their decisions (see in particular Article 
28(1) of the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial 
Arbitration; see also Article 42(1) of the 1965 Convention on the 
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other 
States (ICSID Convention)).  
In line with this approach, the parties would be free to choose the 
Principles as the “rules of law” according to which the arbitrators would 
decide the dispute, with the result that the Principles would apply to the 
exclusion of any particular national law, subject only to the application 
of those rules of domestic law which are mandatory irrespective of 
which law governs the contract (see Comment 4 on Article 1.4). 
In disputes falling under the ICSID Convention, the Principles might 
even be applicable to the exclusion of any domestic rule of law. 
b. The Principles applied as a manifestation of “general principles of 
law”, the “lex mercatoria” or the like referred to in the contract 
Parties to international commercial contracts who cannot agree on 
the choice of a particular domestic law as the law applicable to their 
contract sometimes provide that it shall be governed by the “general 
 
UNIDROIT Principles 
4 
principles of law”, by the “usages and customs of international trade”, 
by the lex mercatoria, etc.  
Hitherto, such reference by the parties to not better identified 
principles and rules of a supranational or transnational character has 
been criticised, among other grounds, because of the extreme vagueness 
of such concepts. In order to avoid, or at least to reduce considerably, 
the uncertainty accompanying the use of such rather vague concepts, it 
might be advisable, in order to determine their content, to have recourse 
to a systematic and well-defined set of rules such as the Principles. 
c. The Principles applied in the absence of any choice of law by the 
parties  
The Principles may however be applied even if the contract is silent 
as to the applicable law. If the parties have not chosen the law governing 
their contract, it has to be determined on the basis of the relevant rules 
of private international law. In the context of international commercial 
arbitration such rules are very flexible, permitting arbitral tribunals to 
apply “the rules of law which they determine to be appropriate” (see, 
e.g., Article 21(1) of the 2012 Rules of Arbitration of the International 
Chamber of Commerce; Article 24(1) of the Arbitration Rules of the 
Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce). 
Normally arbitral tribunals will apply a particular domestic law as the 
proper law of the contract, yet exceptionally they may resort to a-
national or supra-national rules such as the Principles. This may occur 
when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the parties intended 
to exclude the application of any domestic law (e.g. where one of the 
parties is a State or a government agency and both parties have made it 
clear that neither would accept the application of the other’s domestic 
law or that of a third country), or when the contract presents connecting 
factors with many countries none of which is predominant enough to 
justify the application of one domestic law to the exclusion of all the 
others. 
5. The Principles as a means of interpreting and supplementing 
international uniform law instruments 
International uniform law instruments may give rise to questions 
concerning the precise meaning of their individual provisions and may 
present gaps.  
Traditionally international uniform law has been interpreted on the 
basis of, and supplemented by, principles and criteria of domestic law, 
be it the law of the forum or that which would, according to the relevant 
Preamble 
 
5 
rules of private international law, be applicable in the absence of an 
international uniform law. 
Recently, both courts and arbitral tribunals have increasingly 
abandoned such a “conflictual” approach, seeking instead to interpret 
and supplement international uniform law by reference to autonomous 
and internationally uniform principles and criteria. This approach, 
expressly sanctioned, for instance in Article 7 of the 1980 UN 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), is 
based on the assumption that international uniform law, even after its 
incorporation into the various national legal systems, only formally 
becomes an integrated part of the latter, whereas from a substantive 
point of view it does not lose its original character of a special body of 
law autonomously developed at international level and intended to be 
applied in a uniform manner throughout the world. 
Until now, such autonomous principles and criteria for the 
interpretation and supplementing of international uniform law 
instruments have had to be found in each single case by the judges and 
arbitrators themselves on the basis of a comparative survey of the 
solutions adopted in the different national legal systems. The Principles 
could considerably facilitate their task in this respect. 
6. The Principles as a means of interpreting and supplementing 
domestic law 
The Principles may also be used to interpret and supplement 
domestic law. In applying a particular domestic law, courts and arbitral 
tribunals may be faced with doubts as to the proper solution to be 
adopted under that law, either because different alternatives are 
available or because there seem to be no specific solutions at all. 
Especially where the dispute relates to an international commercial 
contract, it may be advisable to resort to the Principles as a source of 
inspiration. By so doing the domestic law in question would be 
interpreted and supplemented in accordance with internationally 
accepted standards and/or the special needs of cross-border trade 
relationships.  
7.  The Principles as a model for national and international 
legislators 
In view of their intrinsic merits the Principles may in addition serve 
as a model to national and international law-makers for the drafting of 
legislation in the field of general contract law or with respect to special 
types of transaction. At a national level, the Principles may be 
particularly useful to those countries which lack a developed body of 
 
UNIDROIT Principles 
6 
legal rules relating to contracts and which intend to update their law, at 
least with respect to foreign economic relationships, to current 
international standards. Not too different is the situation of those 
countries with a well-defined legal system, but which after the dramatic 
changes in their socio-political structure have an urgent need to rewrite 
their laws, in particular those relating to economic and business 
activities. 
At an international level the Principles could become an important 
term of reference for the drafting of conventions and model laws. 
So far the terminology used to express the same concept differs 
considerably from one instrument to another, with the obvious risk of 
misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Such inconsistencies could 
be avoided if the terminology of the Principles were to be adopted as an 
international uniform glossary. 
8.  Other possible uses of the Principles 
The list set out in the Preamble of the different ways in which the 
Principles may be used is not exhaustive.  
Thus, the Principles may also serve as a guide for drafting contracts. 
In particular the Principles facilitate the identification of the issues to be 
addressed in the contract and provide a neutral legal terminology 
equally understandable by all the parties involved. Such a use of the 
Principles is enhanced by the fact that they are available in a large 
number of languages. 
The Principles may also be used as a substitute for the domestic law 
otherwise applicable. This is the case whenever it proves impossible or 
extremely difficult to establish the relevant rule of that particular 
domestic law with respect to a specific issue, i.e. it would entail 
disproportionate efforts and/or costs. The reasons for this generally lie 
in the special character of the legal sources of the domestic law in 
question and/or the cost of accessing them. 
Furthermore, the Principles may be used as course material in 
universities and law schools, thereby promoting the teaching of contract 
law on a truly comparative basis.

CHAPTER  1 
 
 
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  1.1 
(Freedom of contract) 
The parties are free to enter into a contract 
and to determine its content. 
COMMENT 
1. Freedom of contract as a basic principle in the context of 
international trade 
The principle of freedom of contract is of paramount importance in 
the context of international trade. The right of business people to decide 
freely to whom they will offer their goods or services and by whom they 
wish to be supplied, as well as the possibility for them freely to agree on 
the terms of individual transactions, are the cornerstones of an open, 
market-oriented and competitive international economic order. 
2. Economic sectors where there is no competition 
There are of course a number of possible exceptions to the principle 
laid down in this Article. 
As concerns the freedom to conclude contracts with any other 
person, there are economic sectors which States may decide in the 
public interest to exclude from open competition. In such cases the 
goods or services in question can only be requested from the one 
available supplier, which will usually be a public body, and which may 
or may not be under a duty to conclude a contract with whoever makes a 
request, within the limits of the availability of the goods or services. 
3. Limitation of party autonomy by mandatory rules 
With respect to the freedom to determine the content of the contract, 
in the first instance the Principles themselves contain provisions from 
which the parties may not derogate (see Article 1.5). 
Art. 1.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
8 
Moreover, there are mandatory rules, whether of national, inter-
national or supra-national origin, which, if applicable in accordance 
with the relevant rules of private international law, prevail over the 
provisions contained in the Principles and from which the parties cannot 
derogate (see Article 1.4). 
ARTICLE  1.2 
(No form required) 
Nothing in these Principles requires a 
contract, statement or any other act to be made in 
or evidenced by a particular form. It may be 
proved by any means, including witnesses. 
COMMENT 
1. Contracts as a rule not subject to formal requirements 
This Article states the principle that the conclusion of a contract is 
not subject to any requirement as to form. The same principle also 
applies to the subsequent modification or termination of a contract by 
agreement of the parties.  
The principle, which is to be found in many, although not in all, legal 
systems, seems particularly appropriate in the context of international 
trade relationships where, thanks to modern means of communication, 
many transactions are concluded at great speed and by a mixture of 
conversations, 
telefaxes, 
paper 
contracts, 
e-mail 
and 
web 
communication. 
The first sentence of the Article takes into account the fact that some 
legal systems regard requirements as to form as matters relating to 
substance, while others impose them for evidentiary purposes only. The 
second sentence is intended to make it clear that to the extent that the 
principle of freedom of form applies, it implies the admissibility of oral 
evidence in judicial proceedings. 
2. Statements and other unilateral acts 
The principle of no requirement as to form applies also to statements 
and other unilateral acts. The most important such acts are statements of 
intent made by parties either in the course of the formation or 
performance of a contract (e.g. an offer, acceptance of an offer, 
confirmation of the contract by the party entitled to avoid it,  
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.3 
 
9 
determination of the price by one of the parties, etc.), or in other 
contexts (e.g. the grant of authority by a principal to an agent, the 
ratification by a principal of an act performed by an agent without 
authority, the obligor’s acknowledgement of the obligee’s right before 
the expiration of the general limitation period, etc.). 
3. Possible exceptions under the applicable law 
The principle of no requirement as to form may of course be 
overridden by the applicable law (see Article 1.4). National laws as well 
as international instruments may impose special requirements as to form 
with respect either to the contract as a whole or to individual terms (e.g. 
arbitration agreements; choice of court agreements).  
4. Form requirements agreed by the parties 
Moreover, the parties may themselves agree on a specific form for 
the conclusion, modification or termination of their contract or for any 
other statement they may make or unilateral act they may perform in the 
course of the formation or performance of their contract or in any other 
context. In this connection see, in particular, Articles 2.1.13, 2.1.17 and 
2.1.18. 
ARTICLE  1.3 
(Binding character of contract) 
A contract validly entered into is binding 
upon the parties. It can only be modified or 
terminated in accordance with its terms or by 
agreement or as otherwise provided in these 
Principles. 
COMMENT 
1. The principle pacta sunt servanda 
This Article lays down another basic principle of contract law, that of 
pacta sunt servanda. 
 
Art. 1.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
10 
The binding character of a contractual agreement obviously 
presupposes that an agreement has actually been concluded by the parties 
and that the agreement reached is not affected by any ground of invalidity. 
The rules governing the conclusion of contractual agreements are laid 
down in Chapter 2 Section 1 of the Principles, while the grounds of 
invalidity are dealt with in Chapter 3, as well as in individual provisions 
in other Chapters (see, e.g., Articles 7.1.6 and 7.4.13(2)). Additional 
requirements for the valid conclusion of contracts may be found in the 
applicable national or international mandatory rules. 
2. Exceptions 
A corollary of the principle of pacta sunt servanda is that a contract 
may be modified or terminated whenever the parties so agree. 
Modification or termination without agreement are on the contrary the 
exception and can therefore be admitted only when in conformity with 
the terms of the contract or when expressly provided for in the 
Principles (see Articles 3.2.7(2), 3.2.7(3), 3.2.10, 5.1.8, 6.1.16, 6.2.3, 
7.1.7, 7.3.1 and 7.3.3). 
3. Effects on third persons  
By stating the principle of the binding force of the contract between 
the parties, this Article does not intend to prejudice any effect which 
that contract may have vis-à-vis third persons under the applicable law. 
Thus, a seller may in some jurisdictions be under a contractual duty to 
protect the physical integrity and property not only of the buyer, but also 
of accompanying persons during their presence on the seller’s premises. 
Similarly the Principles do not deal with the effects of avoidance and 
termination of a contract on the rights of third persons. 
With respect to cases where the agreement between the parties by its 
very nature is intended to affect the legal relations of other persons, see 
Section 2 of Chapter 2 on “Authority of Agents”, Section 2 of Chapter 5 
on “Third Party Rights”, Chapter 9 on “Assignment of Rights, Transfer 
of Obligations, Assignment of Contracts” and Chapter 11 on “Plurality 
of Obligors and Obligees”. 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.4 
 
11 
ARTICLE  1.4 
(Mandatory rules) 
Nothing in these Principles shall restrict the 
application of mandatory rules, whether of 
national, international or supranational origin, 
which are applicable in accordance with the 
relevant rules of private international law. 
COMMENT 
1. Mandatory rules prevail 
Given the particular nature of the Principles as a non-legislative 
instrument, neither the Principles nor individual contracts concluded in 
accordance with the Principles, can be expected to prevail over 
mandatory rules of domestic law, whether of national, international or 
supranational origin, that are applicable in accordance with the relevant 
rules of private international law. Mandatory rules of national origin are 
those enacted by States autonomously (e.g. particular form requirements 
for specific types of contracts; invalidity of penalty clauses; licensing 
requirements; environmental regulations; etc.), while mandatory rules of 
international or supranational origin are those derived from international 
conventions or general public international law (e.g. Hague-Visby Rules; 
UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects; 
United Nations Convention against Corruption; United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, etc.) or adopted by 
supranational organisations (e.g. European Union competition law, etc.). 
2. Broad notion of “mandatory rules” 
The mandatory rules referred to in this Article are predominantly laid 
down by specific legislation, and their mandatory nature, may either be 
expressly stated or inferred by way of interpretation. However, in the 
various national legal systems restrictions on freedom of contract may 
also derive from general principles of public policy, whether of national, 
international or supranational origin (e.g. prohibition of commission or 
inducement of crime; prohibition of corruption and collusive bidding; 
protection of human dignity; prohibition of discrimination on the basis 
of gender, race or religion; prohibition of undue restraint of trade; etc). 
For the purpose of this Article the notion of “mandatory rules” is to
Art. 1.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
12 
be understood in a broad sense, so as to cover both specific statutory 
provisions and general principles of public policy.    
3. Mandatory rules applicable in case of incorporation of the 
Principles as terms of contract 
Where, as is the traditional and still prevailing approach adopted by 
domestic courts with respect to soft law instruments, the parties’ 
reference to the Principles is considered to be merely an agreement to 
incorporate them in the contract (see Comment 4 lit. (a), third 
paragraph, to the Preamble), the Principles and the individual contracts 
concluded in accordance with the Principles will first of all encounter 
the limit of the principles and rules of the domestic law that govern the 
contract from which parties may not contractually derogate (so-called 
“ordinary” or “domestically mandatory” rules). Moreover, the 
mandatory rules of the forum State, and possibly of other countries, may 
also apply if the mandatory rules claim application irrespective of what 
the law governing the contract is, and, in the case of the mandatory rules 
of other countries, there is a sufficiently close connection between those 
countries and the contract in question (so-called “overriding” or 
“internationally mandatory” rules).   
4. Mandatory rules applicable in case of reference to the Principles 
as law governing the contract 
Where, as may be the case if the dispute is brought before an arbitral 
tribunal, the Principles are applied as the law governing the contract (see 
Comment 4 lit. (a), fourth paragraph, to the Preamble), they no longer 
encounter the limit of the ordinary mandatory rules of any domestic law. 
As far as the overriding mandatory rules of the forum State or of other 
countries are concerned, their application basically depends on the 
circumstances of the case. Generally speaking, since in international 
arbitration the arbitral tribunal lacks a predetermined lex fori, it may, but 
is under no duty to, apply the overriding mandatory rules of the country 
on the territory of which it renders the award. In determining whether to 
take into consideration the overriding mandatory rules of the forum 
State or of any other country with which the case at hand has a 
significant connection, the arbitral tribunal, bearing in mind its task to 
“make every effort to make sure that the Award is enforceable at law” 
(so expressly, e.g., Article 41 of the 2012 ICC Arbitration Rules), may 
be expected to pay particular attention to the overriding mandatory rules
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.5 
 
13 
of those countries where enforcement of the award is likely to be 
sought. Moreover, the arbitral tribunal may consider it necessary to 
apply those overriding mandatory rules that reflect principles widely 
accepted as fundamental in legal systems throughout the world (so-
called “transnational public policy” or “ordre public transnational”). 
5. Recourse to rules of private international law relevant in each 
given case 
In view of the considerable differences in the ways in which 
domestic courts and arbitral tribunals determine the mandatory rules 
applicable 
to 
international 
commercial 
contracts, 
this 
Article 
deliberately refrains from stating which mandatory rules apply and the 
Article refers instead to the relevant rules of private international law for 
the solution in each given case (see, e.g., Article 9 of EC Regulation No. 
593/2008 (Rome I) (replacing Article 7 of the 1980 Rome Convention on 
the Law applicable to Contractual Obligations); Article 11 of the 1994 
Inter-American Convention on the Law Applicable to International 
Contracts; Article 11 of the 2015 Principles on Choice of Law in 
International Commercial Contracts of the Hague Conference on 
Private International Law; Articles 28, 34 and 36 of the UNCITRAL 
Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration; and Article V of 
the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of 
Foreign Arbitral Awards).  
ARTICLE  1.5 
(Exclusion or modification by the parties) 
The parties may exclude the application of 
these Principles or derogate from or vary the 
effect of any of their provisions, except as 
otherwise provided in the Principles. 
COMMENT 
1. The non-mandatory character of the Principles 
The rules laid down in the Principles are in general of a non-
mandatory character, i.e. the parties may in each individual case either 
simply exclude their application in whole or in part or modify their 
content so as to adapt them to the specific needs of the kind of 
Art. 1.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
14 
transaction involved (see the Model Clauses referred to in the footnote 
to the second paragraph of the Preamble). 
2. Exclusion or modification may be express or implied 
The exclusion or modification of the Principles by the parties may be 
either express or implied. There is an implied exclusion or modification 
when the parties expressly agree on contract terms which are 
inconsistent with provisions of the Principles and it is in this context 
irrelevant whether the terms in question have been negotiated 
individually or form part of standard terms incorporated by the parties in 
their contract. 
If the parties expressly agree to the application of some only of the 
Chapters of the Principles (e.g. “As far as the performance and non-
performance of this contract is concerned, the UNIDROIT Principles shall 
apply”), it is presumed that the Chapters concerned will be applied 
together with the general provisions of Chapter 1. 
3. Mandatory provisions to be found in the Principles 
A few provisions of the Principles are of a mandatory character, i.e. 
their importance in the system of the Principles is such that parties 
should not be permitted to exclude or to derogate from them as they 
wish. It is true that given the particular nature of the Principles the non-
observance of this precept may have no consequences. On the other 
hand, it should be noted that the provisions in question reflect principles 
and standards of behaviour which are of a mandatory character under 
most domestic laws also. 
Those provisions of the Principles which are mandatory are normally 
expressly indicated as such. This is the case with Article 1.7 on good 
faith and fair dealing, with the provisions of Chapter 3 on substantive 
validity, except in so far as they relate or apply to mistake and to initial 
impossibility (see Article 3.1.4), with Article 5.1.7(2) on price 
determination, with Article 7.4.13(2) on agreed payment for non-
performance and Article 10.3(2) on limitation periods. Exceptionally, 
the mandatory character of a provision is only implicit and follows from 
the content and purpose of the provision itself (see, e.g., Articles 1.8 and 
7.1.6). 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.6

ARTICLE  1.6 
(Interpretation and supplementation of the Principles) 
(1) In 
the 
interpretation 
of 
these 
Principles, regard is to be had to their 
international character and to their purposes 
including the need to promote uniformity in their 
application. 
(2) Issues within the scope of these 
Principles but not expressly settled by them are as 
far as possible to be settled in accordance with 
their underlying general principles. 
COMMENT 
1. Interpretation of the Principles as opposed to interpretation of 
the contract 
The Principles, like any other legal text, be it of a legislative or of a 
contractual nature, may give rise to doubts as to the precise meaning of 
their content. The interpretation of the Principles is however different 
from that of the individual contracts to which they apply. Even if the 
Principles are considered to bind the parties only at contractual level, i.e. 
their application is made dependent on their incorporation in individual 
contracts, they remain an autonomous set of rules worked out with a 
view to their application in a uniform manner to an indefinite number of 
contracts of different type entered into in various parts of the world. As 
a consequence they must be interpreted in a different manner from the 
terms of each individual contract. The rules for the interpretation of 
contracts (as well as of statements by or other conduct of the parties) are 
laid down in Chapter 4. This Article deals with the manner in which the 
Principles as such are to be interpreted. 
2. Regard to the international character of the Principles  
The first criterion laid down by this Article for the interpretation of 
the Principles is that regard is to be had to their “international 
character”. This means that their terms and concepts are to be 
interpreted autonomously, i.e. in the context of the Principles them-
selves and not by reference to the meaning which might traditionally be 
attached to them by a particular domestic law. 
Art. 1.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
16 
Such an approach becomes necessary if it is recalled that the 
Principles are the result of thorough comparative studies carried out by 
lawyers coming from totally different cultural and legal backgrounds. 
When drafting the individual provisions, these experts had to find 
sufficiently neutral legal language on which they could reach a common 
understanding. Even in the exceptional cases where terms or concepts 
peculiar to one or more national laws are employed, the intention was 
never to use them in their traditional meaning. 
3. Purposes of the Principles 
By stating that in the interpretation of the Principles regard is to be had 
to their purposes, this Article makes it clear that they are not to be 
construed in a strict and literal sense but in the light of the purposes and 
the rationale underlying the individual provisions as well as the Principles 
as a whole. The purpose of the individual provisions can be ascertained 
both from the text itself and from the comments thereon. As to the 
purposes of the Principles as a whole, this Article, in view of the fact that 
the Principles’ main objective is to provide a uniform framework for 
international commercial contracts, expressly refers to the need to 
promote uniformity in their application, i.e. to ensure that in practice they 
are to the greatest possible extent interpreted and applied in the same way 
in different countries. As to other purposes, see the remarks contained in 
the Introduction. See further Article 1.7 which, although addressed to the 
parties, may also be seen as an expression of the underlying purpose of 
the Principles as such to promote the observance of good faith and fair 
dealing in contractual relations. 
4. Supplementation of the Principles 
A number of issues which would fall within the scope of the 
Principles are not settled expressly by them. In order to determine 
whether an issue is one that falls within the scope of the Principles even 
though it is not expressly settled by them, or whether it actually falls 
outside their scope, regard is to be had first to what is expressly stated 
either in the text or in the Comments (see, e.g., Comment 3 on Article 
1.3; Comment  5 on Article 1.4; Article 2.2.1(2) and (3) and Comment 5 
on Article 2.2.1; Comment 5 on Article 2.2.7; Comment 5 on Article 
2.2.9; Comment 1 on Article 2.2.10; Article 3.1.1; Comment 1 on 
Article 6.1.14; Article 9.1.2; Article 9.2.2; Article 9.3.2). A useful 
additional guide in this respect is the subject-matter index of the 
Principles.  
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.7 
 
17 
The need to promote uniformity in the application of the Principles 
implies that when such gaps arise a solution should be found, whenever 
possible, within the system of the Principles itself before resorting to 
domestic laws. 
The first step is to attempt to settle the unsolved question through an 
application by analogy of specific provisions. Thus, Article 6.1.6 on 
place of performance should also govern restitution. Similarly, the rules 
laid down in Article 6.1.9 with respect to the case where a monetary 
obligation is expressed in a currency other than that of the place for 
payment may also be applied when the monetary obligation is expressed 
by reference to units of account such as the Special Drawing Right 
(SDR). If the issue cannot be solved by a mere extension of specific 
provisions dealing with analogous cases, recourse must be made to their 
underlying general principles, i.e. to the principles and rules which may 
be applied on a much wider scale because of their general character. 
Some of these fundamental principles are expressly stated in the 
Principles (see, e.g., Articles 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8). Others have to 
be extracted from specific provisions, i.e. the particular rules contained 
therein must be analysed in order to see whether they can be considered 
an expression of a more general principle, and as such capable of being 
applied also to cases different from those specifically regulated. 
Parties are of course always free to agree on a particular national law 
to which reference should be made for the supplementing of the 
Principles. A provision of this kind could read “This contract is 
governed by the UNIDROIT Principles supplemented by the law of 
Country X”, or “This contract shall be interpreted and executed in 
accordance with the UNIDROIT Principles. Questions not expressly 
settled therein shall be settled in accordance with the law of Country X” 
(see the Model Clauses referred to in the footnote to the second 
paragraph of the Preamble). 
ARTICLE  1.7 
(Good faith and fair dealing) 
(1) Each party must act in accordance 
with good faith and fair dealing in international 
trade. 
(2) The parties may not exclude or limit 
this duty. 
Art. 1.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
18 
COMMENT 
1. “Good faith and fair dealing” as a fundamental idea underlying 
the Principles 
There are a number of provisions throughout the different Chapters 
of the Principles which constitute a direct or indirect application of the 
principle of good faith and fair dealing. See above all Article 1.8, but 
see also for instance, Articles 1.9(2); 2.1.4(2)(b), 2.1.15, 2.1.16, 2.1.18 
and 2.1.20; 2.2.4(2), 2.2.5(2), 2.2.7 and 2.2.10; 3.2.2, 3.2.5 and 3.2.7; 
4.1(2), 4.2(2), 4.6 and 4.8; 5.1.2 and 5.1.3; 5.2.5; 5.3.3 and 5.3.4; 6.1.3, 
6.1.5, 6.1.16(2) and 6.1.17(1); 6.2.3(3)(4); 7.1.2, 7.1.6 and 7.1.7; 
7.2.2(b)(c); 7.4.8 and 7.4.13; 9.1.3, 9.1.4 and 9.1.10(1). This means that 
good faith and fair dealing may be considered to be one of the 
fundamental ideas underlying the Principles. By stating in general terms 
that each party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing, 
paragraph (1) of this Article makes it clear that even in the absence of 
special provisions in the Principles the parties’ behaviour throughout the 
life of the contract, including the negotiation process, must conform to 
good faith and fair dealing. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A grants B forty-eight hours as the time within which B may 
accept its offer. When B, shortly before the expiry of the deadline, 
decides to accept, it is unable to do so: it is the weekend, the fax at 
A’s office is disconnected and there is no telephone answering 
machine which can take the message. When on the following 
Monday A refuses B’s acceptance A acts contrary to good faith since 
when it fixed the time-limit for acceptance it was for A to ensure that 
messages could be received at its office throughout the forty-eight 
hour period. 
2. 
A contract for the supply and installation of a special 
production line contains a provision according to which A, the seller, 
is obliged to communicate to B, the purchaser, any improvements 
made by A to the technology of that line. After a year B learns of an 
important improvement of which it had not been informed. A is not 
excused by the fact that the production of that particular type of 
production line is no longer its responsibility but that of C, a wholly-
owned affiliated company of A. It would be against good faith for A 
to invoke the separate entity of C, which was specifically set up to 
take over this production in order to avoid A’s contractual 
obligations vis-à-vis B. 
3. 
A, an agent, undertakes on behalf of B, the principal, to promote 
the sale of B’s goods in a given area. Under the contract A’s right to 
compensation arises only after B’s approval of the contracts procured 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.7 
 
19 
by A. While B is free to decide whether or not to approve the contracts 
procured by A, a systematic and unjustified refusal to approve any 
contract procured by A would be against good faith. 
4. 
Under a line of credit agreement between A, a bank, and B, a 
customer, A suddenly and inexplicably refuses to make further 
advances to B whose business suffers heavy losses as a consequence. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the agreement contains a term 
permitting A to accelerate payment “at will”, A’s demand for 
payment in full without prior warning and with no justification 
would be against good faith. 
2. Abuse of rights 
A typical example of behaviour contrary to the principle of good 
faith and fair dealing is what in some legal systems is known as “abuse 
of rights”. It is characterised by a party’s malicious behaviour which 
occurs for instance when a party exercises a right merely to damage the 
other party or for a purpose other than the one for which it had been 
granted, or when the exercise of a right is disproportionate to the 
originally intended result.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
5. 
A rents premises from B for the purpose of setting up a retail 
business. The rental contract is for five years, but when three years 
later A realises that business in the area is very poor, it decides to 
close the business and informs B that it is no longer interested in 
renting the premises. A’s breach of contract would normally lead to 
B’s having the choice of either terminating the contract and claiming 
damages or requesting specific performance. However, under the 
circumstances B would be abusing its rights if it required A to pay 
the rent for the remaining two years of the contract instead of 
terminating the contract and claiming damages from A for the rent it 
has lost for the length of time necessary to find a new tenant. 
6. 
A rents premises from B for the purpose of opening a restaurant. 
During the summer months A sets up a few tables out of doors, but 
still on the owner’s property. On account of the noise caused by the 
restaurant’s customers late at night, B has increasing difficulties finding 
tenants for apartments in the same building. B would be abusing its 
rights if, instead of requesting A to desist from serving out of doors 
late at night, it required A not to serve out of doors at all.  
3. “Good faith and fair dealing in international trade” 
The reference to “good faith and fair dealing in international trade” 
first makes it clear that in the context of the Principles the two concepts 
are not to be applied according to the standards ordinarily adopted 
Art. 1.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
20 
within the different national legal systems. In other words, such 
domestic standards may be taken into account only to the extent that 
they are shown to be generally accepted among the various legal 
systems. A further implication of the formula used is that good faith and 
fair dealing must be construed in the light of the special conditions of 
international trade. Standards of business practice may indeed vary 
considerably from one trade sector to another, and even within a given 
trade sector they may be more or less stringent depending on the socio-
economic environment in which the enterprises operate, their size and 
technical skill, etc. 
It should be noted that whenever the provisions of the Principles 
and/or the comments thereto refer only to “good faith and fair dealing”, 
such references should always be understood as a reference to “good 
faith and fair dealing in international trade” as specified in this Article. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
7. 
Under a contract for the sale of high-technology equipment the 
purchaser loses the right to rely on any defect in the goods if it does 
not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the defect 
without undue delay after it has discovered or ought to have 
discovered the defect. A, a buyer operating in a country where such 
equipment is commonly used, discovers a defect in the equipment 
after having put it into operation, but in its notice to B, the seller of 
the equipment, A gives misleading indications as to the nature of the 
defect. A loses its right to rely on the defect since a more careful 
examination of the defect would have permitted it to give B the 
necessary specifications. 
8. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 7, except that A 
operates in a country where this type of equipment is so far almost 
unknown. A does not lose its right to rely on the defect because B, 
being aware of A’s lack of technical knowledge, could not reason-
ably have expected A properly to identify the nature of the defect. 
4. The mandatory nature of the principle of good faith and fair 
dealing 
The parties’ duty to act in accordance with good faith and fair 
dealing is of such a fundamental nature that the parties may not 
contractually exclude or limit it (paragraph (2)). As to specific 
applications of the general prohibition to exclude or limit the principle 
of good faith and fair dealing between the parties, see Articles 3.1.4, 
7.1.6 and 7.4.13.  
 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.8 
 
21 
On the other hand, nothing prevents parties from providing in their 
contract for a duty to observe more stringent standards of behaviour 
(see, e.g., Article 5.3.3). 
ARTICLE 1.8 
(Inconsistent behaviour) 
A party cannot act inconsistently with an 
understanding it has caused the other party to 
have and upon which that other party reasonably 
has acted in reliance to its detriment. 
COMMENT 
1. Inconsistent behaviour and “good faith and fair dealing” 
This provision is a general application of the principle of good faith 
and fair dealing (Article 1.7). It is reflected in other more specific 
provisions of the Principles (see, for example, Articles 2.1.4(2)(b), 
2.1.18, 2.1.20, 2.2.5(2) and Comment 3 on Article 10.4). It imposes a 
responsibility on a party not to occasion detriment to another party by 
acting inconsistently with an understanding concerning their contractual 
relationship which it has caused that other party to have and upon which 
that other party has reasonably acted in reliance. 
The prohibition contained in this Article can result in the creation of 
rights and in the loss, suspension or modification of rights otherwise 
than by agreement of the parties. This is because the understanding 
relied upon may itself be inconsistent with the agreed or actual rights of 
the parties. The Article does not provide the only means by which a 
right might be lost or suspended because of one party’s conduct (see, for 
example, Articles 3.2.9 and 7.1.4(3)). 
2. An understanding reasonably relied upon 
There is a variety of ways in which one party may cause the other 
party to have an understanding concerning their contract, its 
performance, or enforcement. The understanding may result, for 
example, from a representation made, from conduct, or from silence 
when a party would reasonably expect the other to speak to correct a 
known error or misunderstanding that was being relied upon. 
 
 
Art. 1.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
22 
So long as it relates in some way to the contractual relationship of 
the parties, the understanding for the purposes of this Article is not 
limited to any particular subject-matter. It may relate to a matter of fact 
or of law, to a matter of intention, or to how one or other of the parties 
can or must act. 
The important limitation is that the understanding must be one on 
which, in the circumstances, the other party can and does reasonably 
rely. Whether the reliance is reasonable is a matter of fact in the 
circumstances having regard, in particular, to the communications and 
conduct of the parties, to the nature and setting of the parties’ dealings 
and to the expectations they could reasonably entertain of each other. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A has negotiated with B over a lengthy period for a contract of 
lease of B’s land under which B is to demolish a building and 
construct a new one to A’s specification. A communicates with B in 
terms that induce B reasonably to understand that their contract 
negotiations have been completed, and that B can begin perform-
ance. B then demolishes the building and engages contractors to 
build the new building. A is aware of this and does nothing to stop it. 
A later indicates to B that there are additional terms still to be 
negotiated. A will be precluded from departing from B’s 
understanding. 
2. 
B mistakenly understands that its contract with A can be 
performed in a particular way. A is aware of this and stands by while 
B’s performance proceeds. B and A meet regularly. B’s performance 
is discussed but no reference is made by A to B’s mistake. A will be 
precluded from insisting that the performance was not that which 
was required under the contract. 
3. 
A regularly uses B to do sub-contract work on building sites. 
That part of A’s business and the employees involved in it are taken 
over by A1, a related business. There is no change in the general 
course of business by which B obtains its instruction to do work. B 
continues to provide sub-contract services and continues to bill A for 
work done believing the work is being done for A. A does not inform 
B of its mistake. A is precluded from denying that B’s contract for 
work done is with it and must pay for the work done. 
4. 
Because of difficulties it is experiencing with its own suppliers, 
A is unable to make deliveries on time to B under their contract. The 
contract imposes penalties for late delivery. After being made aware 
of A’s difficulties, B indicates it will not insist on strict compliance 
with the delivery schedule. A year later B’s business begins to suffer 
from A’s late deliveries. B seeks to recover penalties for the late 
deliveries to date and to require compliance with the delivery 
schedule for the future. It will be precluded from recovering the 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.8 
 
23 
penalties but will be able to insist on compliance with the schedule if 
reasonable notice is given that compliance is required for the future. 
5. 
B is indebted to A in the sum of AUD 10,000. Though the debt 
is due A takes no steps to enforce it. B assumes in consequence that 
A has pardoned the debt. A has done nothing to indicate that such 
actually is the case. It later demands payment. B cannot rely on A’s 
inaction to resist that demand. 
3. Detriment and preclusion 
The responsibility imposed by the Article is to avoid detriment being 
occasioned in consequence of reasonable reliance. This does not 
necessarily require that the party seeking to act inconsistently must be 
precluded from so doing. Preclusion is only one way of avoiding 
detriment. There may, in the circumstances, be other reasonable means 
available that can avert the detriment the relying party would otherwise 
experience if the inconsistent action were allowed as, for example, by 
giving reasonable notice before acting inconsistently (see Illustration 4), 
or by paying for costs or losses incurred by reason of reliance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
6. 
A and B are parties to a construction contract which requires that 
additional works be documented in writing and be certified by the site 
architect. A’s contract manager orally requests B to do specified 
additional work on a time and materials basis and assures B it will be 
documented appropriately in due course. B commissions design works 
for the additional work at which stage A indicates that the work is not 
required. The cost incurred in commissioning the design work is far 
less than the cost that would be incurred if the additional work were to 
be done. If A pays B the costs incurred by B for the design work, B 
cannot then complain of A’s inconsistent behaviour. 
7. 
A fails to meet on time a prescribed milestone in a software 
development contract with B. B is entitled under the contract to 
terminate the contract because of that failure. B continues to require 
and pay for changes to the software and acts co-operatively with A in 
continuing the software development program. A’s continued 
performance is based on B’s conduct subsequent to the breach. B 
will in such circumstances be precluded from exercising its right to 
terminate for the failure to meet the milestone. However, under the 
Principles B will be able to allow A an additional period of time for 
performance (see Article 7.1.5) and to exercise its right to terminate 
if the milestone is not met in that period. 
 
 
 
Art. 1.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
24 
ARTICLE  1.9 
(Usages and practices) 
(1) The parties are bound by any usage to 
which they have agreed and by any practices 
which they have established between themselves. 
(2) The parties are bound by a usage that 
is widely known to and regularly observed in 
international trade by parties in the particular 
trade concerned except where the application of 
such a usage would be unreasonable. 
COMMENT 
1. Practices and usages in the context of the Principles 
This Article lays down the principle according to which the parties 
are in general bound by practices and usages which meet the 
requirements set forth in the Article. Furthermore, these same 
requirements must be met by practices and usages for them to be 
applicable in the cases and for the purposes expressly indicated in the 
Principles (see, for instance, Articles 2.1.6(3), 4.3, and 5.1.2). 
2. Practices established between the parties 
A practice established between the parties to a particular contract is 
automatically binding, except where the parties have expressly excluded 
its application. Whether a particular practice can be deemed to be 
“established” between the parties will naturally depend on the 
circumstances of the case, but behaviour on the occasion of only one 
previous transaction between the parties will not normally suffice. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a supplier, has repeatedly accepted claims from B, a 
customer, for quantitative or qualitative defects in the goods as much 
as two weeks after their delivery. When B gives another notice of 
defects after a fortnight, A cannot object that it is too late since the 
two-weeks’ notice amounts to a practice established between A and 
B which will as such be binding on A. 
 
 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.9 
 
25 
3. Agreed usages 
By stating that the parties are bound by usages to which they have 
agreed, paragraph (1) of this Article merely applies the general principle 
of freedom of contract laid down in Article 1.1. Indeed, the parties may 
either negotiate all the terms of their contract, or for certain questions 
simply refer to other sources including usages. The parties may stipulate 
the application of any usage, including a usage developed within a trade 
sector to which neither party belongs, or a usage relating to a different 
type of contract. It is even conceivable that the parties will agree on the 
application of what sometimes misleadingly are called usages, i.e. a set 
of rules issued by a particular trade association under the title of 
“Usages”, but which only in part reflects established general lines of 
conduct. 
4. Other applicable usages 
Paragraph (2) lays down the criteria for the identification of usages 
applicable in the absence of a specific agreement by the parties. The fact 
that the usage must be “widely known to and regularly observed [...] by 
parties in the particular trade concerned” is a condition for the 
application of any usage, be it at international or merely at national or 
local level. The additional qualification “in international trade” is 
intended to avoid usages developed for, and confined to, domestic 
transactions also being invoked in transactions with foreigners. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A, a real estate agent, invokes a particular usage of the 
profession in its country vis-à-vis B, a foreign customer. B is not 
bound by such a usage if that usage is of a local nature and relates to 
a trade which is predominantly domestic in character. 
Only exceptionally may usages of a purely local or national origin be 
applied without any reference thereto by the parties. Thus, usages 
existing on certain commodity exchanges or at trade exhibitions or ports 
should be applicable provided that they are regularly followed with 
respect to foreigners as well. Another exception concerns the case of a 
businessperson who has already entered into a number of similar 
contracts in a foreign country and who should therefore be bound by the 
usages established within that country for such contracts. 
Art. 1.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
26 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
3. 
A, a terminal operator, invokes a particular usage of the port 
where it is located vis-à-vis B, a foreign carrier. B is bound by this 
local usage if the port is normally used by foreigners and the usage in 
question has been regularly observed with respect to all customers, 
irrespective of their place of business and of their nationality. 
4. 
A, a sales agent from Country X, receives a request from B, one 
of its customers in Country Y, for the customary 10% discount upon 
payment of the price in cash. A may not object to the application of 
such a usage on account of its being restricted to Country Y if A has 
been doing business in that country for a certain period of time. 
5. Application of usage unreasonable 
A usage may be regularly observed by the generality of business 
people in a particular trade sector but its application in a given case may 
nevertheless be unreasonable. Reasons for this may be found in the 
particular conditions in which one or both parties operate and/or the 
atypical nature of the transaction. In such cases the usage will not be 
applied. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
A usage exists in a commodity trade sector according to which 
the purchaser may not rely on defects in the goods if they are not duly 
certified by an internationally recognised inspection agency. When A, 
a buyer, takes over the goods at the port of destination, the only 
internationally recognised inspection agency operating in that port is 
on strike and to call another from the nearest port would be 
excessively costly. The application of the usage in this case would be 
unreasonable and A may rely on the defects it has discovered even 
though they have not been certified by an internationally recognised 
inspection agency. 
6. Usages prevail over the Principles 
Both courses of dealing and usages, once they are applicable in a 
given case, prevail over conflicting provisions contained in the 
Principles. The reason for this is that they bind the parties as implied 
terms of the contract as a whole or of single statements or other conduct 
on the part of one of the parties. As such, they are superseded by any 
express term stipulated by the parties but, in the same way as the latter, 
they prevail over the Principles, the only exception being those 
provisions which are specifically declared to be of a mandatory 
character (see Comment 3 on Article 1.5). 
 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.10

ARTICLE  1.10 
(Notice) 
(1) Where notice is required it may be given 
by any means appropriate to the circumstances. 
(2) A notice is effective when it reaches the 
person to whom it is given. 
(3) For the purpose of paragraph (2) a 
notice “reaches” a person when given to that 
person orally or delivered at that person’s place 
of business or mailing address. 
(4) For the purpose of this Article “notice” 
includes a declaration, demand, request or any 
other communication of intention. 
COMMENT 
1. Form of notice 
This Article first lays down the principle that notice or any other kind of 
communication of intention (declarations, demands, requests, etc.) 
required by individual provisions of the Principles are not subject to any 
particular requirement as to form, but may be given by any means 
appropriate in the circumstances. Which means are appropriate will 
depend on the actual circumstances of the case, in particular on the 
availability and the reliability of the various modes of communication, 
and the importance and/or urgency of the message to be delivered. For 
an electronic notice to be “appropriate to the circumstances” the 
addressee must expressly or impliedly have consented to receive 
electronic communications in the way in which the notice was sent by 
the sender, i.e. of that type, in that format and to that address. The 
addressee’s consent may be inferred from the addressee’s statements or 
conduct, from practices established between the parties, or from 
applicable usages.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. Seller A and buyer B have a longstanding business relationship in 
the course of which they have always negotiated and concluded their 
contracts by telephone. On discovering a defect in the goods 
supplied on one occasion, B immediately sends A notice thereof by 
e-mail.  A, who does not regularly read its e-mail and had  no  reason  
Art. 1.10 
UNIDROIT Principles 
28 
to expect an e-mail from B, on discovering B’s notice three weeks 
after it had been sent rejects it as being too late. B may not object 
that it had given prompt notice of the defects since the notice was not 
given by a means appropriate to the circumstances. 
2. 
Seller A and buyer B have a longstanding business relationship 
in the course of which they have regularly communicated by electronic 
means. On discovering a defect in the goods supplied on one occasion, 
B immediately sends A notice thereof by e-mail to an e-mail address 
different from the one normally used. A, who had no reason to expect 
an e-mail from B at that address, on discovering B’s notice three 
weeks after it had been sent rejects it as being too late. B may not 
object that it had given prompt notice of the defects since the notice 
was not given by a means appropriate to the circumstances. 
2. Receipt principle 
With respect to all kinds of notices the Principles adopt the so-called 
“receipt” principle, i.e. they are not effective unless and until they reach 
the person to whom they are given. For some communications this is 
expressly stated in the provisions dealing with them: see Articles 
2.1.3(1), 2.1.3(2), 2.1.5, 2.1.6(2), 2.1.8(1) and 2.1.10; 9.1.10 and 9.1.11. 
The purpose of paragraph (2) of this Article is to indicate that the same 
will also be true in the absence of an express statement to this effect: see 
Articles 2.1.9, 2.1.11; 2.2.9; 3.2.10, 3.2.11; 6.1.16; 6.2.3; 7.1.5, 7.1.7; 
7.2.1, 7.2.2; 7.3.2, 7.3.4; and 8.3. 
3. Dispatch principle to be expressly stipulated 
The parties are of course always free expressly to stipulate the 
application of the dispatch principle. This may be appropriate in 
particular with respect to the notice a party has to give in order to preserve 
its rights in cases of the other party’s actual or anticipated non-
performance when it would not be fair to place the risk of loss, mistake or 
delay in the transmission of the message on the former. This is all the 
more true if the difficulties which may arise at international level in 
proving effective receipt of a notice are borne in mind. 
4. “Reaches” 
It is important in relation to the receipt principle to determine 
precisely when the communications in question “reach” the addressee. 
In an attempt to define the concept, paragraph (3) of this Article draws a 
distinction between oral and other communications. The former “reach” 
the addressee if they are made personally to it or to another person 
authorised  by  it to receive them.  The  latter  “reach”  the  addressee  as  
  
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.11 
 
29 
soon as they are delivered either to the addressee personally or to its 
place of business or (electronic) mailing address. The particular 
communication in question need not come into the hands of the 
addressee or actually be read by the addressee. It is sufficient that it be 
handed over to an employee of the addressee authorised to accept it, or 
that it be placed in the addressee’s mailbox, or received by the 
addressee’s fax or telex machine, or, in the case of electronic 
communications when it becomes capable of being retrieved by the 
addressee at an electronic address designated by the addressee (see 
Article 10(2) of the 2005 United Nations Convention on the Use of 
Electronic Communications in International Contracts). 
ARTICLE  1.11 
(Definitions) 
In these Principles 
–  
“court” includes an arbitral tribunal; 
–  
where a party has more than one place 
of business the relevant “place of business” is that 
which has the closest relationship to the contract 
and its performance, having regard to the 
circumstances known to or contemplated by the 
parties at any time before or at the conclusion of 
the contract; 
–  
“long-term 
contract” 
refers 
to 
a 
contract which is to be performed over a period 
of time and which normally involves, to a varying 
degree, complexity of the transaction and an 
ongoing relationship between the parties; 
–  
“obligor” refers to the party who is to 
perform an obligation and “obligee” refers to the 
party who is entitled to performance of that 
obligation; 
–  
“writing” means any mode of commun-
ication that preserves a record of the information 
contained therein and is capable of being 
reproduced in tangible form. 
 
Art. 1.11 
UNIDROIT Principles 
30 
COMMENT 
1. Courts and arbitral tribunals 
The importance of the Principles for the purpose of the settlement of 
disputes by means of arbitration has already been stressed (see above 
the Comments on the Preamble). In order however to avoid undue 
heaviness of language, only the term “court” is used in the text of the 
Principles, on the understanding that it covers arbitral tribunals as well 
as courts. 
2. Party with more than one place of business 
For the purpose of the application of the Principles a party’s place of 
business is of relevance in a number of contexts such as the place for the 
delivery of notices (see Article 1.10(3)); a possible extension of the time 
of acceptance because of a holiday falling on the last day (see Article 
1.12); the place of performance (Article 6.1.6) and the determination of 
the party who should apply for a public permission (Article 6.1.14(a)). 
With reference to a party with multiple places of business (normally 
a central office and various branch offices) this Article lays down the 
rule that the relevant place of business should be considered to be that 
which has the closest relationship to the contract and to its performance. 
Nothing is said with respect to the case where the place of the 
conclusion of the contract and that of performance differ, but in such a 
case the latter would seem to be the more relevant one. In the 
determination of the place of business which has the closest relationship 
to a given contract and to its performance, regard is to be had to the 
circumstances known to or contemplated by both parties at any time 
before or at the conclusion of the contract. Facts known only to one of 
the parties or of which the parties became aware only after the 
conclusion of the contract cannot be taken into consideration. 
3. Long-term contracts 
The Principles, both in the black-letter provisions and the comments, 
refer to “long-term contracts” as distinguished from ordinary exchange 
contracts such as sales contracts to be performed at one time. Three 
elements typically distinguish long-term contracts from ordinary 
exchange contracts: duration of the contract, an ongoing relationship 
between the parties, and complexity of the transaction. For the purpose 
of the Principles, the essential element is the duration of the contract, 
while the latter two elements are normally present to varying degrees, 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.11 
 
31 
but are not required. The extent to which, if at all, one or the other of the 
latter elements must also be present for the application of a provision or 
the relevance of a comment referring to long-term contracts depends on 
the rationale for that provision or comment. For instance, Comment 2 on 
Article 5.1.3 presupposes an ongoing relationship between the parties 
and a transaction involving performance of a complex nature.  
Depending on the context, examples of long-term contracts may 
include contracts involving commercial agency, distributorship, out-
sourcing, franchising, leases (e.g. equipment leases), framework 
agreements, investment or concession agreements, contracts for 
professional services, operation and maintenance agreements, supply 
agreements (e.g. raw materials), construction/civil works contracts, 
industrial cooperation, contractual joint-ventures, etc.  
Provisions and comments of the Principles that explicitly refer to 
long-term contracts are the Preamble, Comment 2; Article 1.11 and 
Comment 3; Article 2.1.14, Comments 1, 3, and 4; Article 2.1.15, 
Comment 3; Article 4.3, Comments 3 and 4; Article 4.8, Comments 1, 2 
and 3; Article 5.1.3, Comment 2; Article 5.1.4, Comment 3; Article 
5.1.8 and Comment 2; Article 6.2.2, Comment 5; Article 7.1.7, 
Comment 5; Article 7.3.5, Comment 4; Article 7.3.6, Comment 1; 
Article 7.3.7 and Comment 1. 
Several other provisions and comments are also particularly relevant 
in the context of long-term contracts. See Articles 1.7; 1.8; 2.1.1, 
Comment 2; 2.1.2, Comments 1 and 2; 2.1.6; 2.1.13 to 2.1.18; 3.3.1; 
3.3.2; 5.1.2; 5.1.7, Comment 3; 5.1.8; 5.3.1, Comment 5; 5.3.4; 6.1.1; 
6.1.4; 6.1.5; 6.1.11; 6.1.14 to 6.1.17; 6.2.1 to 6.2.3; 7.1.3 to 7.1.7; 7.3.5. 
4. “Obligor” – “obligee” 
Where necessary, to better identify the party performing and the 
party receiving performance of obligations the terms “obligor” and 
“obligee” are used, irrespective of whether the obligation is non-
monetary or monetary. 
5. “Writing” 
In some cases the Principles refer to a “writing” or a “contract in 
writing” (see Articles 2.1.12, 2.1.17 and 2.1.18). The Principles define 
this formal requirement in functional terms. Thus, a writing includes not 
only a telegram and a telex, but also any other mode of communication, 
including electronic communications, that preserves a record and can be 
reproduced in tangible form. This formal requirement should be 
compared with the more flexible form of a “notice” (see Article 
1.10(1)).
Art. 1.12 
UNIDROIT Principles 
32 
ARTICLE  1.12 
(Computation of time set by parties) 
(1) Official holidays or non-business days 
occurring during a period set by parties for an act 
to be performed are included in calculating the 
period. 
(2) However, if the last day of the period is 
an official holiday or a non-business day at the 
place of business of the party to perform the act, 
the period is extended until the first business day 
which follows, unless the circumstances indicate 
otherwise. 
(3) The relevant time zone is that of the 
place of business of the party setting the time, 
unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
COMMENT 
The parties may, either unilaterally or by agreement, fix a period of 
time within which certain acts must be done (see, e.g., Articles 2.1.7, 
2.2.9(2) and 10.3).  
In fixing the time limit the parties may either indicate merely a 
period of time (e.g. “Notice of defects in the goods must be given within 
ten days after delivery”) or a precise date (e.g. “Offer firm until 1 
March”).  
In the first case the question arises of whether or not holidays or non-
business days occurring during the period of time are included in 
calculating the period of time, and according to paragraph (1) of this 
Article the answer is in the affirmative.  
In both of the above-mentioned cases, the question may arise of what 
the effect would be of a holiday or non-business day falling at the expiry 
of the fixed period of time at the place of business of the party to 
perform the act. Paragraph (2) provides that in such an eventuality the 
period is extended until the first business day that follows, unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise.  
 
 
General Provisions 
Art. 1.12 
 
33 
Finally, whenever the parties are situated in different time zones, the 
question arises as to what time zone is relevant, and according to 
paragraph (3) it is the time zone of the place of business of the party 
setting the time limit, unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.    
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A sales contract provides that buyer A must give notice of 
defects of the goods within 10 days after delivery. The goods are 
delivered on Friday 16 December. A gives notice of defects on 
Monday 2 January and seller B rejects it as being untimely. A may 
not object that the holidays and non-business days which occurred 
between 16 December and 2 January should not be counted when 
calculating the ten days of the time limit.  
2. 
Offeror A indicates that its offer is firm until 1 March. Offeree 
B accepts the offer on 2 March because 1 March was a holiday at its 
place of business. A may not object that the fixed time limit for 
acceptance had expired on 1 March. 
3. 
Offeror A sends an offer to offeree B by e-mail on a Saturday 
indicating that the offer is firm for 24 hours. If B intends to accept, it 
must do so within 24 hours, even though the time limit elapses on a 
Sunday, since under the circumstances the time limit fixed by A was 
to be understood as absolute.   
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2, except that A is 
situated in Frankfurt and B in New York, and the time limit fixed for 
acceptance is “by 5 p.m. tomorrow at the latest”. B must accept by 5 
p.m. Frankfurt time.  
5. 
A charterparty concluded between owner A, situated in Tokyo, 
and charterer B, situated in Kuwait City, provides for payment of the 
freight by B at A’s bank in Zurich, Switzerland, on a specific date by 
5 p.m. at latest. The relevant time zone is neither that of A nor that of 
B, but that of Zurich where payment is due.

CHAPTER  2 
 
 
 
FORMATION AND AUTHORITY OF AGENTS 
 
 
 
SECTION  1:  FORMATION 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  2.1.1 
(Manner of formation) 
A contract may be concluded either by the 
acceptance of an offer or by conduct of the parties 
that is sufficient to show agreement. 
COMMENT 
1. Offer and acceptance 
Basic to the Principles is the idea that the agreement of the parties is, 
in itself, sufficient to conclude a contract (see Article 3.1.2). The 
concepts of offer and acceptance have traditionally been used to 
determine whether, and if so when, the parties have reached agreement. 
As this Article and this Chapter make clear, the Principles retain these 
concepts as essential tools of analysis. 
2. Conduct sufficient to show agreement 
In commercial practice contracts, particularly when related to 
complex transactions, are often concluded after prolonged negotiations 
without an identifiable sequence of offer and acceptance. In such cases 
it may be difficult to determine if and when a contractual agreement has 
been reached. According to this Article a contract may be held to be 
concluded even though the moment of its formation cannot be 
determined, provided that the conduct of the parties is sufficient to show 
agreement. In order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of 
the parties’ intention to be bound by a contract, their conduct has to be 
interpreted in accordance with the criteria set forth in Article 4.1 et seq. 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.2 
 
35 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A and B enter into negotiations with a view to setting up a joint 
venture for the development of a new product. After prolonged 
negotiations without any formal offer or acceptance and with some 
minor points still to be settled, both parties begin to perform. When 
subsequently the parties fail to reach an agreement on these minor 
points, a court or arbitral tribunal may decide that a contract was 
nevertheless concluded since the parties had begun to perform, 
thereby showing their intention to be bound by a contract. 
3. Automated contracting   
The language of this Article is sufficiently broad to cover also cases 
of so-called automated contracting, i.e. where the parties agree to use a 
system capable of setting in motion self-executing electronic actions 
leading to the conclusion of a contract without the intervention of a 
natural person. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
Automobile manufacturer A and components supplier B set up 
an electronic data interchange system which, as soon as A’s stocks of 
components fall below a certain level, automatically generates orders 
for the components and executes such orders. The fact that A and B 
have agreed on the operation of such a system makes the orders and 
performances binding on A and B, even though they have been 
generated without the personal intervention of A and B. 
ARTICLE  2.1.2 
(Definition of offer) 
A proposal for concluding a contract 
constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and 
indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound 
in case of acceptance. 
COMMENT 
In defining an offer as distinguished from other communications 
which a party may make in the course of negotiations initiated with a 
view to concluding a contract, this Article lays down two requirements: 
the proposal must (i) be sufficiently definite to permit the conclusion of 
the contract by mere acceptance and (ii) indicate the intention of the 
offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. 
Art. 2.1.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
36 
1. Definiteness of an offer 
Since a contract is concluded by the mere acceptance of an offer, the 
terms of the future agreement must already be indicated with sufficient 
definiteness in the offer itself. Whether a given offer meets this 
requirement cannot be established in general terms. Even essential 
terms, such as the precise description of the goods or the services to be 
delivered or rendered, the price to be paid for them, the time or place of 
performance, etc., may be left undetermined in the offer without 
necessarily rendering it insufficiently definite: all depends on whether or 
not the offeror by making the offer, and the offeree by accepting it, 
intend to enter into a binding agreement, and whether or not the missing 
terms can be determined by interpreting the language of the agreement 
in accordance with Articles 4.1 et seq., or supplied in accordance with 
Articles 4.8 or 5.1.2. Indefiniteness may moreover be overcome by 
reference to practices established between the parties or to usages (see 
Article 1.9), as well as by reference to specific provisions to be found 
elsewhere in the Principles (e.g. Articles 5.1.6 (Determination of quality 
of performance), 5.1.7 (Price determination), 6.1.1 (Time of 
performance), 6.1.6 (Place of performance) and 6.1.10 (Currency not 
expressed)).

1. 
A has for a number of years annually renewed a contract with B 
for technical assistance for A’s computers. A opens a second office 
with the same type of computers and asks B to provide assistance 
also for the new computers. B accepts and, despite the fact that A’s 
offer does not specify all the terms of the agreement, a contract has 
been concluded since the missing terms can be taken from the 
previous contracts as constituting a practice established between the 
parties. 
2. Intention to be bound 
The second criterion for determining whether a party makes an offer 
for the conclusion of a contract, or merely opens negotiations, is that 
party’s intention to be bound in the event of acceptance. Since such an 
intention will rarely be declared expressly, it often has to be inferred 
from the circumstances of each individual case. The way in which the 
proponent presents the proposal (e.g. by expressly defining it as an 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.3 
 
37 
“offer” or as a mere “declaration of intent”) provides a first, although 
not a decisive, indication of possible intention. Of even greater 
importance are the content and the addressees of the proposal. Generally 
speaking, the more detailed and definite the proposal, the more likely it 
is to be construed as an offer. A proposal addressed to one or more 
specific persons is more likely to be intended as an offer than is one 
made to the public at large.

After lengthy negotiations the Executive Directors of two 
companies, A and B, lay down the conditions on which B will 
acquire 51% of the shares in company C which is totally owned by 
A. The “Memorandum of Agreement” signed by the negotiators 
contains a final clause stating that the agreement is not binding until 
approved by A’s Board of Directors. There is no contract before such 
approval is given by them. 
3. 
A, a Government agency, advertises for bids for the setting up 
of a new telephone network. Such an advertisement is merely an 
invitation to submit offers, which may or may not be accepted by A. 
If, however, the advertisement indicates in detail the technical 
specifications of the project and states that the contract will be 
awarded to the lowest bid conforming to the specifications, it may 
amount to an offer with the consequence that the contract will be 
concluded once the lowest bid has been identified. 
A proposal may contain all the essential terms of the contract but 
nevertheless not bind the proponent in case of acceptance if it makes the 
conclusion of the contract dependent on the reaching of agreement on 
some minor points left open in the proposal (see Article 2.1.13). 
ARTICLE  2.1.3 
(Withdrawal of offer) 
(1) An offer becomes effective when it 
reaches the offeree. 
(2) An offer, even if it is irrevocable, may 
be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the 
offeree before or at the same time as the offer. 
Art. 2.1.4

COMMENT 
1. When an offer becomes effective 
Paragraph (1) of this Article, which is taken literally from Article 15 
CISG, provides that an offer becomes effective when it reaches the 
offeree (see Article 1.10(2)). For the definition of “reaches” see Article 
1.10(3). The time at which the offer becomes effective is of importance 
as it indicates the precise moment as from which the offeree can accept 
it, thus definitely binding the offeror to the proposed contract.  
2. Withdrawal of an offer 
There is, however, a further reason why it may in practice be 
important to determine the moment at which the offer becomes 
effective. Indeed, up to that time the offeror is free to change its mind 
and to decide not to enter into the agreement at all, or to replace the 
original offer by a new one, irrespective of whether or not the original 
offer was intended to be irrevocable. The only condition is that the 
offeree is informed of the offeror’s altered intentions before or at the 
same time as the offeree is informed of the original offer. By expressly 
stating this, paragraph (2) of this Article makes it clear that a distinction 
is to be drawn between “withdrawal” and “revocation” of an offer: 
before an offer becomes effective it can always be withdrawn whereas 
the question of whether or not it may be revoked (see Article 2.1.4) 
arises only after that moment. 
ARTICLE  2.1.4 
(Revocation of offer) 
(1) Until a contract is concluded an offer 
may be revoked if the revocation reaches the 
offeree before it has dispatched an acceptance. 
(2) However, an offer cannot be revoked 
(a) if it indicates, whether by stating a 
fixed time for acceptance or otherwise, that it is 
irrevocable; or 
(b) if it was reasonable for the offeree to 
rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the 
offeree has acted in reliance on the offer.

COMMENT 
The problem of whether an offer is or is not revocable is traditionally 
one of the most controversial issues in the context of the formation of 
contracts. Since there is no prospect of reconciling the two basic 
approaches followed in this respect by the different legal systems, i.e. 
the common law approach according to which an offer is as a rule 
revocable, and the opposite approach followed by the majority of civil 
law systems, the only remaining possibility is that of selecting one 
approach as the main rule, and the other as the exception.  
1. Offers as a rule revocable 
Paragraph (1) of this Article, which is taken literally from Article 16 
CISG, states that until the contract is concluded offers are as a rule 
revocable. The same paragraph, however, subjects the revocation of an 
offer to the condition that it reach the offeree before the offeree has 
dispatched an acceptance. It is thus only when the offeree orally accepts 
the offer, or when the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act 
without giving notice to the offeror (see Article 2.1.6(3)), that the 
offeror’s right to revoke the offer continues to exist until such time as 
the contract is concluded. Where, however, the offer is accepted by a 
written indication of assent, so that the contract is concluded when the 
acceptance reaches the offeror (see Article 2.1.6(2)), the offeror’s right 
to revoke the offer terminates earlier, i.e. when the offeree dispatches 
the acceptance. Such a solution may cause some inconvenience to the 
offeror who will not always know whether or not it is still possible to 
revoke the offer. It is, however, justified in view of the legitimate 
interest of the offeree in the time available for revocation being 
shortened.  
As to the determination of the time of dispatch, see Article 2.1.8 and 
the Comment thereto. 
2. Irrevocable offers 
Paragraph (2) provides for two important exceptions to the general 
rule as to the revocability of offers: (i) where the offer contains an 
indication that it is irrevocable and (ii) where the offeree, having other 
good reasons to treat the offer as being irrevocable, has acted in reliance 
on that offer. 
a. Indication of irrevocability contained in the offer 
The indication that the offer is irrevocable may be made in different 
ways, the most direct and clear of which is an express statement to that 
Art. 2.1.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
40 
effect by the offeror (e.g. “This is a firm offer”; “We shall stand by our 
offer until we receive your answer”). It may, however, simply be 
inferred from other statements by, or conduct of, the offeror. The 
indication of a fixed time for acceptance may, but need not necessarily, 
amount by itself to an implicit indication of an irrevocable offer. The 
answer must be found in each case through a proper interpretation of the 
terms of the offer in accordance with the various criteria laid down in 
the general rules on interpretation in Chapter 4. In general, if the offeror 
operates within a legal system where the fixing of a time for acceptance 
is considered to indicate irrevocability, it may be assumed that by 
specifying such a fixed time the offeror intends to make an irrevocable 
offer. If, on the other hand, the offeror operates in a legal system where 
the fixing of a time for acceptance is not sufficient to indicate 
irrevocability, the offeror will not normally have had such an intention.

1. 
A, a travel agency, informs a client of a cruise in its brochure for 
the coming New Year holidays. It urges the client to book within the 
next three days, adding that after that date there will probably be no 
more places left. This statement by itself will not be considered to 
indicate that the offer is irrevocable during the first three days. 
2. 
A invites B to submit a written offer of the terms on which B is 
prepared to construct a building. B presents a detailed offer 
containing the statement “Price and other conditions are not good 
after 1 September”. If A and B operate within a legal system where 
such a statement is considered to be an indication that the offer is 
irrevocable until the specified date, B can expect the offer to be 
understood as being irrevocable. The same may not necessarily be 
the case if the offeree operates in a legal system where such a 
statement is not considered as being sufficient to indicate that the 
offer is irrevocable. 
b. Reliance by offeree on irrevocability of offer 
The second exception to the general rule regarding the revocability 
of offers, i.e. where “it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the 
offer as being irrevocable”, and “the offeree has acted in reliance on the 
offer”, is an application of the general principle prohibiting 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.5 
 
41 
inconsistent behaviour laid down in Article 1.8. The reasonable reliance 
of the offeree may have been induced either by the conduct of the 
offeror, or by the nature of the offer itself (e.g. an offer whose 
acceptance requires extensive and costly investigation on the part of the 
offeree or an offer made with a view to permitting the offeree in turn to 
make an offer to a third party). The acts which the offeree must have 
performed in reliance on the offer may consist in making preparations 
for production, buying or hiring of materials or equipment, incurring 
expenses etc., provided that such acts could have been regarded as 
normal in the trade concerned, or should otherwise have been foreseen 
by, or known to, the offeror.

A, an antique dealer, asks B to restore ten paintings on condition 
that the work is completed within three months and that the price does 
not exceed a specific amount. B informs A that, so as to know whether 
or not to accept the offer, B finds it necessary to begin work on one 
painting and will then give a definite answer within five days. A 
agrees, and B, relying on A’s offer, begins work immediately. A may 
not revoke the offer during those five days. 
4. 
A seeks an offer from B for incorporation in a bid on a project 
to be assigned within a stated time. B submits an offer on which A 
relies when calculating the price of the bid. Before the expiry of the 
date, but after A has made the bid, B informs A that it is no longer 
willing to stand by its offer. B’s offer is irrevocable until the stated 
date since in making its bid A relied on B’s offer. 
ARTICLE  2.1.5 
(Rejection of offer) 
An offer is terminated when a rejection 
reaches the offeror. 
COMMENT 
1. Rejection may be express or implied 
An offer may be rejected either expressly or impliedly. A frequent 
case of implied rejection is a reply to an offer which purports to be an 
acceptance but which contains additions, limitations or other modi-
fications (see Article 2.1.11(1)).  
Art. 2.1.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
42 
In the absence of an express rejection the statements by, or the conduct 
of, the offeree must in any event be such as to justify the belief of the 
offeror that the offeree has no intention of accepting the offer. A reply on 
the part of the offeree which merely asks whether there would be a 
possible alternative (e.g. “Is there any chance of the price being 
reduced?”, or “Could you deliver a couple of days earlier?”) would not 
normally be sufficient to justify such a conclusion. 
It should be recalled that a rejection will bring about the termination 
of any offer, irrespective of whether it was revocable or irrevocable 
according to Article 2.1.4. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A receives an offer from B stating that the offer will be firm for two 
weeks. A replies by return of post asking for partially different 
conditions which B does not accept. A may no longer accept the 
original offer even though there are still several days left before the 
expiry of the two week period since by making a counter-offer A 
implicitly rejected the original offer. 
2. Rejection only one cause of termination of an offer 
Rejection by the offeree is only one of the causes of termination of 
an offer. Other causes are dealt with in Articles 2.1.4(1) and 2.1.7. 
ARTICLE  2.1.6 
(Mode of acceptance) 
(1) A statement made by or other conduct 
of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an 
acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself 
amount to acceptance. 
(2) An acceptance of an offer becomes 
effective when the indication of assent reaches the 
offeror. 
(3) However, if, by virtue of the offer or as 
a result of practices which the parties have 
established between themselves or of usage, the 
offeree may indicate assent by performing an act 
without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is 
effective when the act is performed. 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.6 
 
43 
COMMENT 
1. Indication of assent to an offer 
For there to be an acceptance the offeree must in one way or another 
indicate “assent” to the offer. The mere acknowledgement of receipt of 
the offer, or an expression of interest in it, is not sufficient. Furthermore, 
the assent must be unconditional, i.e. it cannot be made dependent on 
some further step to be taken by either the offeror (e.g. “Our acceptance 
is subject to your final approval”) or the offeree (e.g. “We hereby accept 
the terms of the contract as set forth in your Memorandum and 
undertake to submit the contract to our Board for approval within the 
next two weeks”). Finally, the purported acceptance must contain no 
variation of the terms of the offer or at least none which materially alters 
them (see Article 2.1.11). 
2. Acceptance by conduct 
Provided that the offer does not impose any particular mode of 
acceptance, the indication of assent may either be made by an express 
statement or be inferred from the conduct of the offeree. Paragraph (1) 
of this Article does not specify the form such conduct should assume: 
most often it will consist in acts of performance, such as the payment of 
an advance on the price, the shipment of goods or the beginning of work 
at the site, etc. 
3. Silence or inactivity 
By stating that “[s]ilence or inactivity does not in itself amount to 
acceptance”, paragraph (1) makes it clear that as a rule mere silence or 
inactivity on the part of the offeree does not allow the inference that the 
offeree assents to the offer. The situation is different if the parties 
themselves agree that silence shall amount to acceptance, or if there 
exists a course of dealing or usage to that effect. In no event, however, 
is it sufficient for the offeror to state unilaterally in its offer that the 
offer will be deemed to have been accepted in the absence of any reply 
from the offeree. Since it is the offeror who takes the initiative by 
proposing the conclusion of the contract, the offeree is free not only to 
accept or not to accept the offer, but also simply to ignore it. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A requests B to set out the conditions for the renewal of a 
contract for the supply of wine, due to expire on 31 December. In its 
offer B includes a provision stating that “if we have not heard from 
you at the latest by the end of November, we will assume that you 
Art. 2.1.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
44 
have agreed to renew the contract on the conditions indicated 
above”. A finds the proposed conditions totally unacceptable and 
does not even reply. The former contract expires on the fixed date 
without a new contract having been agreed between the parties. 
2. 
Under a long-term contract for the supply of wine B regularly 
met A’s orders without expressly confirming its acceptance. On 15 
November A orders a large stock for New Year. B does not reply, nor 
does it deliver at the requested time. B is in breach since, in 
accordance with the practice established between the parties, B’s 
silence in regard to A’s order amounts to an acceptance. 
4. When acceptance becomes effective 
According to paragraph (2), an acceptance becomes effective at the 
moment the indication of assent reaches the offeror (see Article 
1.10(2)). For the definition of “reaches” see Article 1.10(3). The reason 
for the adoption of the “receipt” principle in preference to the “dispatch” 
principle is that the risk of transmission is better placed on the offeree 
than on the offeror, since it is the former who chooses the means of 
communication, who knows whether the chosen means of communica-
tion is subject to special risks or delay, and who is consequently best able 
to take measures to ensure that the acceptance reaches its destination. 
As a rule, an acceptance by means of mere conduct likewise becomes 
effective only when notice thereof reaches the offeror. It should be 
noted, however, that special notice to this effect by the offeree will be 
necessary only in cases where the conduct will not of itself give notice of 
acceptance to the offeror within a reasonable period of time. In all other 
cases, e.g. where the conduct consists in the payment of the price, or the 
shipment of the goods by air or by some other rapid mode of 
transportation, the same effect may well be achieved simply by the bank 
or the carrier informing the offeror of the funds transfer or of the 
consignment of the goods.  
An exception to the general rule of paragraph (2) is to be found in the 
cases envisaged in paragraph (3), i.e. where “by virtue of the offer or as 
a result of practices which the parties have established between 
themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by performing 
an act without notice to the offeror”. In such cases the acceptance is 
effective at the moment the act is performed, irrespective of whether or 
not the offeror is promptly informed thereof.

A asks B to write a special program for the setting up of a data 
bank. Without giving A notice of acceptance, B begins to write the 
program and, after its completion, insists on payment in accordance 
with the terms set out in A’s offer. B is not entitled to payment since 
B’s purported acceptance of A’s offer never became effective as B 
never notified A of it. 
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, except that in the 
offer B is informed of A’s absence for the following two weeks, and 
that if B intends to accept the offer B should begin writing the 
program immediately so as to save time. The contract is concluded 
once B begins to perform, even if B fails to inform A thereof either 
immediately or at a later stage. 
This Article corresponds to paragraphs (1), (2) first part and (3) of 
Article 18 CISG.  
ARTICLE  2.1.7 
(Time of acceptance) 
An offer must be accepted within the time 
the offeror has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a 
reasonable 
time 
having 
regard 
to 
the 
circumstances, including the rapidity of the means 
of communication employed by the offeror. An 
oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise. 
COMMENT 
With respect to the time within which an offer must be accepted, this 
Article, which corresponds to the second part of paragraph (2) of Article 
18 CISG, distinguishes between written and oral offers.  
As concerns written offers, all depends upon whether or not the offer 
indicated a specific time for acceptance: if it did, the offer must be 
accepted within that time, while in all other cases the indication of 
assent must reach the offeror “within a reasonable time having regard to 
the 
circumstances, 
including 
the 
rapidity of 
the 
means 
of 
communication employed by the offeror”.

A sends B an offer on Monday indicating that if B intends to 
accept, it must do so by Friday at the latest. B’s acceptance reaches 
A on the Monday of the following week. A may reject B’s 
acceptance as being too late.   
2. 
A sends B an offer on Monday morning by e-mail, urging B to 
reply “as soon as possible”. Although on previous occasions A and B 
had already communicated by e-mail, B accepts A’s offer by letter 
which reaches A on Thursday. B’s acceptance is too late since under 
the circumstances an acceptance by a letter which reaches A three days 
after its e-mail was not made “as soon as possible”. 
Oral offers must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances 
indicate otherwise. An offer is to be considered oral not only when 
made in the presence of the offeree, but whenever the offeree can 
respond immediately. This is the case of an offer made over the phone 
or communicated electronically in real time. 
It is important to note that the rules laid down in this Article also 
apply to situations where, in accordance with Article 2.1.6(3), the 
offeree may indicate assent by performing an act without notice to the 
offeror: in these cases it is the act of performance which has to be 
accomplished within the respective periods of time. 
For the determination of the precise starting point of the period of 
time fixed by the offeror, see Article 2.1.8; as to the calculation of 
holidays falling within that period of time, see Article 1.12; as to cases 
of late acceptance and of delay in transmission, see Article 2.1.9.  
ARTICLE  2.1.8 
(Acceptance within a fixed period of time) 
A period of acceptance fixed by the offeror 
begins to run from the time that the offer is 
dispatched. A time indicated in the offer is 
deemed to be the time of dispatch unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise. 
COMMENT 
Whenever an offeror fixes a period of time for acceptance the 
question arises of when the period begins to run. According to this 
Article it begins to run from the moment the offer is dispatched, i.e.

Art. 2.1.9

has left the sphere of control of the offeror. As to when this occurs there 
is a presumption that the time of dispatch is the time indicated in the 
offer. For instance, in the case of a letter, the date of despatch will be the 
date shown on the letter; in the case of an e-mail, it will be the time 
indicated as the sending time by the offeror’s server; etc. However, the 
presumption may be rebutted if in a given case the circumstances 
indicate otherwise. Thus, if the date shown on a fax letter is prior to the 
sending date printed by the fax machine, the latter date should prevail. 
Likewise, if the date shown on a letter is later than the delivery date of 
the letter, it is clear that the latter was written in by mistake and should 
therefore be disregarded. 
ARTICLE  2.1.9 
(Late acceptance. Delay in transmission) 
(1) A late acceptance is nevertheless 
effective as an acceptance if without undue delay 
the offeror so informs the offeree or gives notice 
to that effect. 
(2) If a communication containing a late 
acceptance shows that it has been sent in such 
circumstances that if its transmission had been 
normal it would have reached the offeror in due 
time, the late acceptance is effective as an 
acceptance unless, without undue delay, the 
offeror informs the offeree that it considers the 
offer as having lapsed. 
COMMENT 
1. Late acceptance normally ineffective 
According to the principle laid down in Article 2.1.7, for an 
acceptance to be effective it must reach the offeror within the time fixed 
by the latter or, if no time is fixed, within a reasonable time. This means 
that as a rule an acceptance which reaches the offeror thereafter is 
without effect and may be disregarded by the offeror. 
Art. 2.1.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
48 
2. Offeror may nevertheless “accept” late acceptance 
Paragraph (1) of this Article, which corresponds to Article 21 CISG, 
states that the offeror may nevertheless consider a late acceptance as 
having arrived in time and thus render it effective, provided that the 
offeror “without undue delay [...] so informs the offeree or gives notice to 
that effect”. If the offeror takes advantage of this possibility, the contract 
is to be considered as having been concluded as soon as the late 
acceptance reaches the offeror and not when the offeror informs the 
offeree of its intention to consider the late acceptance effective. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A indicates 31 March as the deadline for acceptance of its offer. 
B’s acceptance reaches A on 3 April. A, who is still interested in the 
contract, intends to “accept” B’s late acceptance, and immediately 
informs B of its intention. Notwithstanding the fact that this notice 
only reaches B on 5 April the contract is concluded on 3 April. 
3. Acceptance late because of delay in transmission 
As long as the acceptance is late because the offeree did not send it 
in time, it is natural to consider it as having no effect unless the offeror 
expressly indicates otherwise. The situation is different when the offeree 
has replied in time, but the acceptance reaches the offeror late because 
of an unexpected delay in transmission. In such a case the reliance of the 
offeree on the acceptance having arrived in time deserves protection, 
with the consequence that the late acceptance is considered to be 
effective unless the offeror objects without undue delay. The only 
condition required by paragraph (2) is that the communication 
containing the late acceptance show that it was sent in such 
circumstances that, had its transmission been normal, it would have 
reached the offeror in due time. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B, 
knowing that the normal time for transmission of letters by mail to A 
is three days, sends its letter of acceptance on 25 March. Owing to a 
strike of the postal service in A’s country the letter, which shows the 
date of its mailing on the envelope, only arrives on 3 April. B’s 
acceptance, though late, is nevertheless effective unless A objects 
without undue delay.

3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B, after 
receiving A’s offer, accepts it on 30 March by e-mail. Due to 
technical problems at A’s server, the e-mail reaches A only on 1 
April. B’s acceptance, though late, is nevertheless effective unless A 
objects without undue delay. 
ARTICLE  2.1.10 
(Withdrawal of acceptance) 
An acceptance may be withdrawn if the 
withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the 
same time as the acceptance would have become 
effective. 
COMMENT 
With respect to the withdrawal of an acceptance this Article lays 
down the same principle as that contained in Article 2.1.3 concerning 
the withdrawal of an offer, i.e. that the offeree may change its mind and 
withdraw the acceptance provided that the withdrawal reaches the 
offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance. 
It should be noted that while the offeror is bound by the offer and 
may no longer change its mind once the offeree has dispatched the 
acceptance (see Article 2.1.4(1)), the offeree looses its freedom of 
choice only at a later stage, i.e. when the notice of acceptance reaches 
the offeror. 
This Article corresponds to Article 22 CISG. 
ARTICLE  2.1.11 
(Modified acceptance) 
(1) A reply to an offer which purports to 
be 
an 
acceptance 
but 
contains 
additions, 
limitations or other modifications is a rejection of 
the offer and constitutes a counter-offer. 
Art. 2.1.11 
UNIDROIT Principles 
50 
(2) However, a reply to an offer which 
purports to be an acceptance but contains addi-
tional or different terms which do not materially 
alter the terms of the offer constitutes an 
acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue 
delay, objects to the discrepancy. If the offeror 
does not object, the terms of the contract are the 
terms of the offer with the modifications 
contained in the acceptance. 
COMMENT 
1. Acceptance with modifications normally to be considered a 
counter-offer 
In commercial dealings it often happens that the offeree, while 
signifying to the offeror its intention to accept the offer 
(“acknowledgement of order”), nevertheless includes in its declaration 
terms additional to or different from those of the offer. Paragraph (1) of 
this Article provides that such a purported acceptance is as a rule to be 
considered a rejection of the offer and that it amounts to a counter-offer 
by the offeree, which the offeror may or may not accept either expressly 
or impliedly, e.g. by an act of performance. 
2. Modifications which do not alter the nature of the acceptance  
The principle according to which the acceptance must be the mirror 
image of the offer implies that even unimportant differences between 
the offer and the acceptance permit either party at a later stage to 
question the existence of the contract. In order to avoid such a result, 
which a party may well seek merely because market conditions have 
changed unfavourably, paragraph (2) provides for an exception to the 
general rule laid down in paragraph (1) by stating that if the additional 
or modified terms contained in the acceptance do not “materially” alter 
the terms of the offer, the contract is concluded with those modifications 
unless the offeror objects without undue delay. 
What amounts to a “material” modification cannot be determined in 
the abstract but will depend on the circumstances of each case. 
Additional or different terms relating to the price or mode of payment, 
place and time of performance of a non-monetary obligation, the extent 
of one party’s liability to the other or the settlement of disputes, will 
normally, but need not necessarily, constitute a material modification 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.12 
 
51 
of the offer. An important factor to be taken into account in this respect 
is whether the additional or different terms are commonly used in the 
trade sector concerned and therefore do not come as a surprise to the 
offeror. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A orders a machine from B to be tested on A’s premises. In its 
acknowledgement of order B declares that it accepts the terms of the 
offer, but adds that it wishes to be present at the testing of the 
machine. The additional term is not a “material” modification of the 
offer and will therefore become part of the contract unless A objects 
without undue delay. 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that in its 
acknowledgement of order B adds an arbitration clause. Unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise, such a clause amounts to a 
“material” modification of the terms of the offer, with the result that 
B’s purported acceptance would constitute a counter-offer. 
3. 
A orders a stated quantity of wheat from B. In its 
acknowledgement of order B adds an arbitration clause which is 
standard practice in the commodity sector concerned. Since A cannot 
be surprised by such a clause, it is not a “material” modification of 
the terms of the offer and, unless A objects without undue delay, the 
arbitration clause becomes part of the contract. 
ARTICLE  2.1.12 
(Writings in confirmation) 
If a writing which is sent within a reasonable 
time after the conclusion of the contract and which 
purports to be a confirmation of the contract 
contains additional or different terms, such terms 
become part of the contract, unless they materially 
alter the contract or the recipient, without undue 
delay, objects to the discrepancy. 
COMMENT 
1. “Writings in confirmation” 
This Article deals with the situation where a contract has already 
been concluded either orally or by the exchange of written 
communications limited to the essential terms of the agreement, and 
Art. 2.1.12 
UNIDROIT Principles 
52 
one party subsequently sends the other a document intended simply to 
confirm what has already been agreed upon, but which in fact contains 
terms which are additional to or different from those previously agreed 
by the parties. In theory, this situation clearly differs from that 
envisaged in Article 2.1.11, where a contract has not yet been concluded 
and the modifying terms are contained in the offeree’s purported 
acceptance. Yet, since in practice it may be very difficult if not 
impossible to distinguish between the two situations, this Article adopts 
with respect to modifying terms contained in a writing in confirmation 
the same solution as that envisaged in Article 2.1.11. In other words, 
just as for the modifications contained in an acknowledgement of order, 
it is provided that terms additional to or different from those previously 
agreed by the parties contained in a writing in confirmation become part 
of the contract, provided that they do not “materially” alter the 
agreement and that the recipient of the document does not object to 
them without undue delay. 
It goes without saying that also in the context of writings in 
confirmation the question of which of the new terms “materially” alter 
the terms of the previous agreement can be answered definitely only in 
the light of the circumstances of each individual case. On the other 
hand, this Article clearly does not apply to cases where the party 
sending the writing in confirmation expressly invites the other party to 
return it duly counter-signed for acceptance. In such circumstances it is 
irrelevant whether the writing contains modifications, and if so whether 
or not these modifications are “material” since the writing must in any 
case be expressly accepted by the addressee if there is to be a contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A orders by telephone a machine from B, who accepts the 
order. The following day A receives a letter from B confirming the 
terms of their oral agreement but adding that B wishes to be present 
at the testing of the machine on A’s premises. The additional term is 
not a “material” modification of the terms previously agreed between 
the parties and will therefore become part of the contract unless A 
objects without undue delay. 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the 
modification contained in B’s writing in confirmation consists in the 
addition of an arbitration clause. Unless the circumstances indicate 
otherwise such a clause amounts to a “material” modification of the 
terms previously agreed between the parties with the result that it 
will not become part of the contract.

Art. 2.1.13

3. 
A orders by e-mail a stated quantity of wheat and B accepts 
immediately by e-mail. Later on the same day B sends a letter to A 
confirming the terms of their agreement but adding an arbitration 
clause which is standard practice in the commodity sector concerned. 
Since A cannot be surprised by such a clause, it is not a “material” 
modification of the terms previously agreed and, unless A objects 
without undue delay, the arbitration clause becomes part of the 
contract. 
2. Writing in confirmation to be sent within a reasonable time after 
conclusion of the contract 
The rule according to which silence on the part of the recipient 
amounts to acceptance of the content of the writing in confirmation, 
including any non-material modifications of the terms previously agreed, 
presupposes that the writing is sent “within a reasonable time after the 
conclusion of the contract”. Any writing of this kind sent after a period of 
time which, in the circumstances, appears to be unreasonably long, loses 
any significance, and silence on the part of the recipient may therefore no 
longer be interpreted as acceptance of its content. 
3. Invoices 
For the purposes of this Article, the term “writing in confirmation” is 
to be understood in a broad sense, i.e. as covering also those cases 
where a party uses the invoice or another similar document relating to 
performance to specify the conditions of the contract concluded either 
orally or by informal correspondence, provided that such use is 
customary in the trade sector and/or country concerned. 
ARTICLE  2.1.13 
(Conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on  
specific matters or in a particular form) 
Where in the course of negotiations one of 
the parties insists that the contract is not 
concluded until there is agreement on specific 
matters or in a particular form, no contract is 
concluded before agreement is reached on those 
matters or in that form. 
Art. 2.1.13 
UNIDROIT Principles 
54 
COMMENT 
1. Conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on specific 
matters 
As a rule, a contract is concluded if the parties reach agreement on 
the terms which are essential to the type of transaction involved, while 
minor terms which the parties have not settled may subsequently be 
implied either in fact or by law (see Comment 1 on Article 2.1.2 and 
also Articles 4.8 and 5.1.2). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A agrees with B on all the terms which are essential to their 
intended contract for the distribution of A’s goods. When the 
question subsequently arises of who should bear the costs of the 
publicity campaign, neither party may claim that no contract has 
come into existence by reason of the silence of the contract on this 
point, as the missing term is not essential to the type of transaction in 
question and will be implied in fact or by law. 
Parties may, however, in a given case consider specific matters to be 
of such importance that they do not intend to enter into a binding 
agreement unless these matters are settled in a satisfactory manner. If 
the parties, or one only of them, make such an intention explicit, the 
contract as such does not come into existence without agreement on 
those matters. By using the word “insists”, this Article makes it clear 
that it is not sufficient for the parties to manifest their intention to this 
effect simply in passing, but that it must be done unequivocally. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that during the 
negotiations B repeatedly declares that the question of who should 
bear the cost of the publicity campaign must be settled expressly. 
Notwithstanding their agreement on all the essential terms of the 
contract, no contract has come into existence between A and B since 
B had insisted that the conclusion of the contract was dependent on 
agreement regarding that specific term. 
2. Conclusion of contract dependent on agreement in a particular 
form  
In 
commercial 
practice, 
particularly 
when 
transactions 
of 
considerable complexity are involved, it is quite frequent that after 
prolonged negotiations the parties sign an informal document called 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.14 
 
55 
“Preliminary Agreement”, “Memorandum of Understanding”, “Letter of 
Intent” or the like, containing the terms of the agreement so far reached, 
but at the same time state their intention to provide for the execution of 
a formal document at a later stage (“Subject to Contract”, “Formal 
Agreement to follow”). In some cases the parties consider their contract 
as already being concluded and the execution of the formal document 
only as confirmation of the already complete agreement. If, however, 
both parties, or only one of them, make it clear that they do not intend to 
be bound unless the formal document has been drawn up, there will be 
no contract until that time even if the parties have agreed on all the 
relevant aspects of their transaction. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
3. 
After prolonged negotiations A and B sign a “Memorandum of 
Understanding” containing the terms of an agreement for a joint 
venture for the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf 
of country X. The parties agree that they will at a later stage draw up 
the agreement in formal documents to be signed and exchanged at a 
public ceremony. If the “Memorandum” already contains all the 
relevant terms of the agreement and the subsequent documents are 
intended merely to permit the agreement to be properly presented to 
the public, it may be taken that the contract was already concluded 
when the first written document was signed. 
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, except that the 
“Memorandum of Understanding” contains a clause such as “Not 
binding until final agreement is executed” or the like. Until the 
signing and the exchange of the formal documents there is no 
binding contract. 
ARTICLE  2.1.14 
(Contract with terms deliberately left open) 
(1) If the parties intend to conclude a 
contract, the fact that they intentionally leave a 
term to be agreed upon in further negotiations or 
to be determined by one of the parties or by a 
third person does not prevent a contract from 
coming into existence. 
(2) The existence of the contract is not 
affected by the fact that subsequently 
(a) the parties reach no agreement on the 
term; 
Art. 2.1.14 
UNIDROIT Principles 
56 
(b) the party who is to determine the term 
does not do so; or  
(c) the third person does not determine the 
term, 
provided that there is an alternative means of 
rendering the term definite that is reasonable in 
the circumstances, having regard to the intention 
of the parties. 
COMMENT 
1. Contract with terms deliberately left open 
A contract may be silent on one or more issues because the parties 
simply did not think of them during the negotiations. Provided that the 
parties have agreed on the terms essential to the type of transaction 
concerned, a contract will nonetheless have been concluded and the 
missing terms will be supplied on the basis of Articles 4.8 or 5.1.2 (see 
Comment 1 on Article 2.1.2). Quite different is the case dealt with in 
this Article: here the parties intentionally leave open one or more terms 
because they are unable or unwilling to determine them at the time of 
the conclusion of the contract, and refer for their determination to an 
agreement to be made by them at a later stage, or to a determination to 
be made by one of them or by a third person. 
This latter situation, which is especially frequent in, although not 
confined to, long-term contracts, gives rise in essence to two problems: 
first, whether the fact that the parties have intentionally left terms open 
prevents a contract from coming into existence and second, if this is not 
the case, what will happen to the contract if the parties subsequently fail 
to reach agreement or if the party or third person who is to make the 
determination does not do so. 
2. Open terms not in themselves an impediment to valid conclusion 
of contract 
Paragraph (1) states that if the parties intended to conclude a 
contract, the fact that they have intentionally left a term to be agreed 
upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the parties or 
by a third person does not prevent a contract from coming into 
existence. 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.14 
 
57 
In cases where it is not expressly stated, the parties’ intention to 
conclude a contract notwithstanding the terms left open may be inferred 
from other circumstances, such as the non-essential character of the 
terms in question, the degree of definiteness of the agreement as a 
whole, the fact that the open terms relate to items which by their very 
nature can be determined only at a later stage, the fact that the 
agreement has already been partially executed, etc. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a shipping line, enters into a detailed agreement with B, a 
terminal operator, for the use of B’s container terminal. The 
agreement fixes the minimum volume of containers to be discharged 
or loaded annually and the fees payable, while the fees for additional 
containers are left to be determined if and when the minimum 
volume is reached. Two months later A learns that B’s competitor 
would offer better conditions and refuses to perform, claiming that 
the agreement with B never resulted in a binding contract because 
the question of the fees had not been settled. A is liable for non-
performance because the detailed character of the agreement as well 
as the fact that both A and B began performance immediately 
indicate clearly that their intention was to enter into a binding 
agreement. 
3. Failure of mechanism provided for by parties for determination 
of open terms 
If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the open terms or if 
the party or the third person who is to make the determination does not 
do so, the question arises as to whether or not the contract comes to an 
end. According to paragraph (2) of this Article the existence of the 
contract is not affected “provided that there is an alternative means of 
rendering the term definite that is reasonable in the circumstances, 
having regard to the intention of the parties”.  
The alternative means of supplying the missing term will generally 
be application of the “gap-filling” provisions in Section 1 of Chapter 5 
and Section 1 of Chapter 6, for example, by determining the price under 
Article 5.1.7(1) or by fixing the time for performance under Article 
6.1.1 where those provisions can appropriately supply the relevant term. 
There may be situations, particularly in respect of long-term contracts, 
where those provisions may not be appropriate even where they cover 
the subject-matter of the missing term. In such situations, the term will 
be supplied by Article 4.8 or Article 5.1.2.  
Art. 2.1.14 
UNIDROIT Principles 
58 
Where the parties have deferred the determination of the missing 
term to a third person to be nominated by a named institution or person 
such as the President of a Tribunal, or a Chamber of Commerce, etc., if 
the nominated third person does not determine the term, a new third 
person may be nominated. The cases in which it will be necessary to 
nominate a new third person are likely to be quite rare in practice. Few 
problems should arise as long as the term to be implemented is of minor 
importance. If, on the other hand, the term in question is essential to the 
type of transaction concerned, there must be clear evidence of the 
intention of the parties to uphold the contract: among the factors to be 
taken into account in this connection are whether the term in question 
relates to items which by their very nature can be determined only at a 
later stage, whether the agreement has already been partially executed, 
etc. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that when the 
minimum volume of containers to be loaded or unloaded is reached 
the parties fail to agree on the fees payable in respect of the 
additional containers. A stops performing, claiming that the contract 
has come to an end. A is liable for non-performance, since the fact 
that the parties have started performing without making future 
agreement on the missing term a condition for the continuation of 
their business relationship is sufficient evidence of their intention to 
uphold the contract even in the absence of such agreement. The fees 
for the additional containers will then generally be determined 
according to the criteria laid down in Article 5.1.7. 
4. Open terms in long-term contracts 
As stated above and particularly in the case of long-term contracts, 
the parties may leave a term to be agreed when that term applies only to 
obligations at a later stage of the contract. For example, the parties may 
agree a price which is only to apply during the first year of the contract, 
leaving open the price to apply for the second or subsequent years. 
Equally, the parties may leave open the date for delivery because, for 
instance, the delivery of a piece of machinery may depend on the 
completion of a building before it is delivered. In such circumstances 
the term as to price may not be appropriately supplied by reference to 
Article 5.1.7 nor may time of performance be appropriately supplied by 
reference to Article 6.1.1. The appropriate term would then be supplied 
by Article 4.8 or Article 5.1.2.

The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the fees 
payable in respect of the additional containers are fixed for the first 
year but there is no provision as to the fees to be charged for the 
second or subsequent years. In such a case it may not be appropriate 
to determine the fees in accordance with Article 5.1.7 by reference to 
a price “at the time of the conclusion of the contract”. Instead, it may 
be appropriate to fix a fee by reference to the date at the end of the 
first year. A term to that effect could be supplied under Article 4.8 or 
Article 5.1.2. 
 
4. 
X is a power company and has decided to construct a new 
power station. X is purchasing a generator from Y. The generator 
will be installed directly onto the foundations in the generator 
building at the power station after that building has been completed. 
A generator can be delivered no earlier than 3 years after it is 
ordered. X has not yet entered into a construction contract for the 
power station but the generator building will only take 6 months to 
complete once the construction contract starts. X places a contract 
now for the generator so that it will be ready in time but cannot yet 
fix a time for delivery. The parties leave the date of delivery as “to 
be agreed”. If they do not agree a date for delivery, it may not be 
appropriate to determine the time for delivery as being “within a 
reasonable time after conclusion of the contract” between X and Y, 
in accordance with the provisions of Article 6.1.1. It may be 
appropriate to fix a term by reference to the completion of the 
generator building. A term to that effect could be supplied under 
Article 4.8 or Article 5.1.2.  
ARTICLE  2.1.15 
(Negotiations in bad faith)

liable for failure to reach an agreement.

(3) It is bad faith, in particular, for a party

intending not to reach an agreement with the

COMMENT 
1. Freedom of negotiation 
As a rule, parties are not only free to decide when and with whom to 
enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a contract, but also if, 
how and for how long to proceed with their efforts to reach an 
agreement. This follows from the basic principle of freedom of contract 
enunciated in Article 1.1, and is essential in order to guarantee healthy 
competition among business people engaged in international trade. 
2. Liability for negotiating in bad faith 
A party’s right freely to enter into negotiations and to decide on the 
terms to be negotiated is, however, not unlimited, and must not conflict 
with the principle of good faith and fair dealing laid down in Article 1.7. 
One particular instance of negotiating in bad faith which is expressly 
indicated in paragraph (3) of this Article is that where a party enters into 
negotiations or continues to negotiate without any intention of 
concluding an agreement with the other party. Other instances are where 
one party has deliberately or by negligence misled the other party as to 
the nature or terms of the proposed contract, either by actually 
misrepresenting facts, or by not disclosing facts which, given the nature 
of the parties and/or the contract, should have been disclosed. As to the 
duty of confidentiality, see Article 2.1.16. 
A party’s liability for negotiating in bad faith is limited to the losses 
caused to the other party (paragraph (2)). In other words, the aggrieved 
party may recover the expenses incurred in the negotiations and may 
also be compensated for the lost opportunity to conclude another 
contract with a third person (so-called reliance or negative interest), but 
may generally not recover the profit which would have resulted had the 
original contract been concluded (so-called expectation or positive 
interest).

A learns of B’s intention to sell its restaurant. A, who has no 
intention whatsoever of buying the restaurant, nevertheless enters 
into lengthy negotiations with B for the sole purpose of preventing B 
from selling the restaurant to C, a competitor of A’s. A, who breaks 
off negotiations when C has bought another restaurant, is liable to B 
for B’s losses. These losses may include the difference in price and 
whatever other losses may be established. 
2. 
A, who is negotiating with B for the promotion of the purchase 
of military equipment by the armed forces of B’s country, learns that 
B will not receive the necessary import licence from its own 
governmental authorities, a pre-requisite for permission to pay B’s 
fees. A does not reveal this fact to B and finally concludes the 
contract, which, however, cannot be enforced by reason of the 
missing licence. A is liable to B for the costs incurred after A had 
learned of the impossibility of obtaining the required licence. 
3. 
A enters into lengthy negotiations for a bank loan from B’s 
branch office. At the last minute the branch office discloses that it 
had no authority to sign and that its head office has decided not to 
approve the draft agreement. A, who could in the meantime have 
obtained the loan from another bank, is entitled to recover the 
expenses entailed by the negotiations and the profits it would have 
made during the delay before obtaining the loan from the other bank. 
 
3. Agreement to negotiate in good faith 
By contrast, if the parties have specifically agreed on a duty to 
negotiate in good faith, all appropriate remedies for non-performance 
will be available, including the right to performance (such as by 
directing the parties to negotiate) and other remedies reflecting the 
expectation or positive interest (to the extent that the requirements for 
such remedies can be demonstrated). 
An agreed-upon duty to negotiate in good faith means, at the least, a 
duty to negotiate (or re-negotiate) seriously with an intent to conclude 
an agreement, but not that an agreement must be reached. Of course, 
this duty does not displace other duties under the Principles (e.g. 
Articles 1.8 and 2.1.16). In the case of a complex long-term contract, 
parties who agree on a duty to negotiate in good faith may wish to 
define further that duty in light of the nature of the contract and its 
commercial context. For example, they may set standards of 
confidentiality, agree on a timetable for the negotiation, etc.

Contractor A and supplier B enter into a pre-bid agreement 
whereby they undertake to negotiate in good faith for the supply of 
equipment in the event that A succeeds in becoming prime contractor 
for a major construction project. A is awarded the construction 
contract, but after preliminary contacts with B refuses to continue the 
negotiations. B may request enforcement of the duty to negotiate in 
good faith.  
4. Liability for breaking off negotiations in bad faith 
The right to break off negotiations also is subject to the principle of 
good faith and fair dealing. Once an offer has been made, it may be 
revoked only within the limits provided for in Article 2.1.4. Yet even 
before this stage is reached, or in a negotiation process with no 
ascertainable sequence of offer and acceptance, a party may no longer 
be free to break off negotiations abruptly and without justification. 
When such a point of no return is reached depends on the circumstances 
of the case, in particular the extent to which the other party, as a result 
of the conduct of the first party, had reason to rely on the positive 
outcome of the negotiations, and on the number of issues relating to the 
future contract on which the parties have already reached agreement.

franchise. When all is ready for the signing of the agreement, A 
informs B that the latter must invest a substantially higher sum. B, 
who refuses, is entitled to recover from A the expenses incurred with 
a view to the conclusion of the contract.

(Duty of confidentiality) 
Where information is given as confidential 
by one party in the course of negotiations, the 
other party is under a duty not to disclose that 
information or to use it improperly for its own 
purposes,

COMMENT 
1. Parties in general not under a duty of confidentiality 
Just as there exists no general duty of disclosure, so parties, when 
entering into negotiations for the conclusion of a contract, are normally 
under no obligation to treat the information they have exchanged as 
confidential. In other words, since a party is normally free to decide 
which facts relevant to the transaction under negotiation to disclose, 
such information is as a rule to be considered non-confidential, i.e. 
information which the other party may either disclose to third persons or 
use for purposes of its own should no contract be concluded. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A invites B and C, producers of air-conditioning systems, to 
submit offers for the installation of such a system. In their offers B 
and C also provide some technical details regarding the functioning 
of their respective systems, with a view to enhancing the merits of 
their products. A decides to reject B’s offer and to continue 
negotiations only with C. A is free to use the information contained 
in B’s offer in order to induce C to propose more favourable 
conditions. 
2. Confidential information 
A party may have an interest in certain information given to the other 
party not being divulged or used for purposes other than those for which 
it was given. As long as that party expressly declares that such 
information is to be considered confidential, the situation is clear, 
Art. 2.1.16 
UNIDROIT Principles 
64 
for by receiving the information the other party implicitly agrees to treat 
it as confidential. The only problem which may arise is that if the period 
during which the other party is not to disclose the information is too 
long, this might contravene the applicable laws prohibiting restrictive 
trade practices. Yet even in the absence of such an express declaration 
the receiving party may be under a duty of confidentiality. This is the 
case where, in view of the particular nature of the information or the 
professional qualifications of the parties, it would be contrary to the 
general principle of good faith and fair dealing for the receiving party to 
disclose it, or to use it for its own purposes after the breaking off of 
negotiations.

disclose it to C, nor is A allowed to use those plans for its own

The breach of confidentiality implies first liability in damages. The 
amount of damages recoverable may vary, depending on whether or not 
the parties entered into a special agreement for the non-disclosure of the 
information. Even if the injured party has not suffered any loss, it may 
be entitled to recover from the non-performing party the benefit the 
latter received by disclosing the information to third persons or by using 
it for its own purposes. If necessary, for example when the information 
has not yet been disclosed or has been disclosed only partially, the 
injured party may also seek an injunction in accordance with the 
applicable law.

Art. 2.1.18

ARTICLE  2.1.17 
(Merger clauses) 
A contract in writing which contains a 
clause indicating that the writing completely 
embodies the terms on which the parties have 
agreed cannot be contradicted or supplemented 
by evidence of prior statements or agreements. 
However, such statements or agreements may be 
used to interpret the writing. 
COMMENT 
If the conclusion of a contract is preceded by more or less extended 
negotiations, the parties may wish to put their agreement in writing and 
declare that document to constitute their final agreement. This can be 
achieved by an appropriately drafted “merger” or “integration” clause 
(e.g. “This contract contains the entire agreement between the parties”). 
However, the effect of such a clause is not to deprive prior statements or 
agreements of any relevance: they may still be used as a means of 
interpreting the written document (see also Article 4.3(a)). 
A merger clause of course covers only prior statements or 
agreements between the parties and does not preclude subsequent 
informal agreements between them. The parties are, however, free to 
extend an agreed form even to future amendments (see Article 2.1.18). 
This Article indirectly confirms the principle set out in Article 1.2 in 
the sense that, in the absence of a merger clause, extrinsic evidence 
supplementing or contradicting a written contract is admissible. 
ARTICLE  2.1.18 
(Modification in a particular form) 
A contract in writing which contains a 
clause requiring any modification or termination 
by agreement to be in a particular form may not 
be otherwise modified or terminated. However, a 
party may be precluded by its conduct from 
asserting such a clause to the extent that the other 
party has reasonably acted in reliance on that 
conduct. 
Art. 2.1.18 
UNIDROIT Principles 
66 
COMMENT 
Parties concluding a written contract may wish to ensure that any 
modification or termination by agreement will also be in writing or 
otherwise in a particular form and to this end include a special clause in 
the contract (e.g. “Any modification of this Contract may be made only 
by a writing signed by both Parties"; "Alterations to the above-indicated 
Time-schedule must be confirmed in writing by the Engineer’s 
representative on site”).  
This Article states that as a rule such a clause renders ineffective any 
modification or termination by agreement not in the particular form 
required. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Contractor A contracts with purchaser B for the construction of 
a building. The contract provides that any modification to the work 
schedule must be in writing and the document must be signed by 
both parties. In the course of construction, A sends B an e-mail 
asking B to agree to the extension of a particular deadline. B accepts 
by return of e-mail. The modification is ineffective since there is no 
single document bearing both parties’ signature. 
Yet there is an exception to the general rule. In application of the 
general principle prohibiting inconsistent behaviour (see Article 1.8), 
this Article specifies that a party may be precluded by its conduct from 
invoking the clause requiring any modification or termination to be in a 
particular form to the extent that the other party has reasonably acted in 
reliance on that conduct. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A, a contractor, contracts with B, a school board, for the 
construction of a new school building. The contract provides that the 
second floor of the building is to have sufficient bearing capacity to 
support the school library. Notwithstanding a “no oral modification” 
clause in the same contract, the parties orally agree that the second 
floor of the building should be of non-bearing construction. A 
completes construction according to the modification and B, who has 
observed the progress of the construction without making any 
objections, only at this point objects to how the second floor has 
been constructed. A court may decide that B is not entitled to invoke 
the “no oral modification” clause as A reasonably relied on the oral 
modification, and is therefore not liable for non-performance.

ARTICLE  2.1.19 
(Contracting under standard terms) 
(1) Where one party or both parties use 
standard terms in concluding a contract, the 
general rules on formation apply, subject to 
Articles 2.1.20 – 2.1.22. 
(2) Standard terms are provisions which 
are prepared in advance for general and repeated 
use by one party and which are actually used 
without negotiation with the other party. 
COMMENT 
1. Contracting under standard terms 
This Article is the first of four articles (Articles 2.1.19 – 2.1.22) 
which deal with the special situation where one or both parties use 
standard terms in concluding a contract. 
2. Notion of “standard terms” 
“Standard terms” are to be understood as those contract provisions 
which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one party 
and which are actually used without negotiation with the other party 
(paragraph (2)). What is decisive is not their formal presentation (e.g. 
whether they are contained in a separate document or in the contract 
document itself; whether they have been issued on pre-printed forms or 
are only contained in an electronic file, etc.), nor who prepared them 
(the party itself, a trade or professional association, etc.), nor their 
volume (whether they consist of a comprehensive set of provisions 
covering almost all the relevant aspects of the contract, or of only one or 
two provisions regarding, for instance, exclusion of liability and 
arbitration). What is decisive is the fact that they are drafted in advance 
for general and repeated use and that they are actually used in a given 
case by one of the parties without negotiation with the other party. This 
latter requirement obviously relates only to the standard terms as such, 
which the other party must accept as a whole, while the other terms of 
the same contract may well be the subject of negotiation between the 
parties. 
Art. 2.1.19 
UNIDROIT Principles 
68 
3. General rules on formation apply 
Usually, the general rules on formation apply irrespective of whether 
or not one or both parties use standard terms (paragraph (1)). It follows 
that standard terms proposed by one party bind the other party only on 
acceptance, and that it depends upon the circumstances of the case 
whether the two parties must refer to the standard terms expressly or 
whether the incorporation of such terms may be implied. Thus, standard 
terms contained in the contract document itself will normally be binding 
upon the mere signature of the contract document as a whole, at least as 
long as they are reproduced above that signature and not, for instance, 
on the reverse side of the document. On the other hand, standard terms 
contained in a separate document or electronic file will normally have to 
be referred to expressly by the party intending to use them. Implied 
incorporation may be admitted only if there exists a practice established 
between the parties or usage to that effect (see Article 1.9). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A intends to conclude an insurance contract with B covering 
the risk of liability for accidents of A’s employees at work. The 
parties sign a model contract form presented by B after filling in the 
blank spaces relating, among other matters, to the premium and to 
the maximum amount insured. By virtue of its signature, A is bound 
not only by the terms which it has individually negotiated with B, 
but also by the General Conditions of the National Insurers’ 
Association, which are printed on the form.  
2. 
A normally concludes contracts with its customers on the basis 
of its own standard terms which are printed as a separate document. 
When making an offer to B, a new customer, A fails to make an 
express reference to the standard terms. B accepts the offer. The 
standard terms are not incorporated in the contract unless A can 
prove that B knew or ought to have known of A’s intention to 
conclude the contract only on the basis of its own standard terms, 
e.g. because the same standard terms had regularly been adopted in 
previous transactions.  
3. 
A intends to buy grain on the commodity exchange in London. 
In the contract concluded between A and B, a broker on that 
exchange, no express reference is made to the standard terms which 
normally govern brokerage contracts concluded at the exchange in 
question. The standard terms are nevertheless incorporated in the 
contract because their application to the kind of contract in question 
amounts to a usage.

ARTICLE  2.1.20 
(Surprising terms) 
(1) No term contained in standard terms 
which is of such a character that the other party 
could not reasonably have expected it, is effective 
unless it has been expressly accepted by that 
party. 
(2) In determining whether a term is of 
such a character regard shall be had to its 
content, language and presentation. 
COMMENT 
1. Surprising terms in standard terms not effective  
A party which accepts the other party’s standard terms is in principle 
bound by them irrespective of whether or not it actually knows their 
content in detail or fully understands their implications. An important 
exception to this rule is, however, laid down in this Article which states 
that, notwithstanding its acceptance of the standard terms as a whole, 
the adhering party is not bound by those terms which by virtue of their 
content, language or presentation are of such a character that it could not 
reasonably have expected them. The reason for this exception is the 
desire to avoid a party which uses standard terms taking undue 
advantage of its position by surreptitiously attempting to impose terms 
on the other party which that party would scarcely have accepted had it 
been aware of them. For other articles intended to protect the 
economically weaker or less experienced party, see Articles 3.2.7 and 
4.6. 
2. Terms “surprising” by virtue of their content 
A particular term contained in standard terms may come as a surprise 
to the adhering party first by reason of its content. This is the case 
whenever the content of the term in question is such that a reasonable 
person of the same kind as the adhering party would not have expected 
it in the type of standard terms involved. In determining whether or not 
a term is unusual, regard must be had on the one hand to the terms 
which are commonly to be found in standard terms generally used in the 
trade sector concerned, and on the other to the individual negotiations 
between the parties. Thus, for example, a term excluding or limiting the 
contractual liability of the proponent may or may not be considered
Art. 2.1.20 
UNIDROIT Principles 
70 
to be “surprising”, and in consequence ineffective in a particular case, 
its effectiveness depending on whether or not terms of that kind are 
common in the trade sector concerned, and are consistent with the way 
in which the parties conducted their negotiations. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a travel agency, offers package tours for business trips. The 
terms of the advertisement give the impression that A is acting as a 
tour operator who undertakes full responsibility for the various 
services comprising the package. B books a tour on the basis of A’s 
standard terms. Notwithstanding B’s acceptance of the terms as a 
whole, A may not rely on a term stating that, with respect to the hotel 
accommodation, it is acting merely as an agent for the hotelkeeper, 
and therefore declines any liability. 
3. Terms “surprising” by virtue of their language or presentation 
Other reasons for a particular term contained in standard terms being 
surprising to the adhering party may be the language in which it is 
couched, which may be obscure, or the way in which it is presented 
typographically, for instance in minute print. In order to determine 
whether or not this is the case, regard is to be had not so much to the 
formulation and presentation commonly used in the type of standard 
terms involved, but more to the professional skill and experience of 
persons of the same kind as the adhering party. Thus, a particular 
wording may be both obscure and clear at the same time, depending on 
whether or not the adhering party belongs to the same professional 
category as the party using the standard terms. 
The language factor may also play an important role in the context of 
international transactions. If the standard terms are drafted in a foreign 
language it cannot be excluded that some of its terms, although fairly 
clear in themselves, will turn out to be surprising for the adhering party 
who could not reasonably have been expected fully to appreciate all 
their implications. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2. 
A, an insurance company operating in country X, is an affiliate 
of B, a company incorporated in country Y. A’s standard terms 
comprise some 50 terms printed in small type. One of the terms 
designates the law of country Y as the applicable law. Unless this 
term is presented in bold letters or in any other way apt to 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.21 
 
71 
attract the attention of the adhering party, it will be without effect 
since customers in country X would not reasonably expect to find a 
choice-of-law clause designating a foreign law as the law governing 
their contracts in the standard terms of a company operating in their 
own country. 
3. 
A, a commodity dealer operating in Hamburg, uses in its contracts 
with its customers standard terms containing, among others, a 
provision stating “Hamburg – Freundschaftliche Arbitrage”. In local 
business circles this clause is normally understood as meaning that 
possible disputes are to be submitted to a special arbitration governed 
by particular rules of procedure of local origin. In contracts with 
foreign customers this clause may be held to be ineffective, 
notwithstanding the acceptance of the standard terms as a whole, since 
a foreign customer cannot reasonably be expected to understand its 
exact implications, and this irrespective of whether or not the clause 
has been translated into the foreign customer’s own language. 
4. Express acceptance of “surprising” terms 
The risk of the adhering party being taken by surprise by the kind of 
terms so far discussed clearly no longer exists if in a given case the 
other party draws the adhering party’s attention to them and the 
adhering party accepts them. This Article therefore provides that a party 
may no longer rely on the “surprising” nature of a term in order to 
challenge its effectiveness, once it has expressly accepted the term. 
ARTICLE  2.1.21 
(Conflict between standard terms  
and non-standard terms) 
In case of conflict between a standard term 
and a term which is not a standard term the latter 
prevails. 
COMMENT 
Standard terms are by definition prepared in advance by one party or 
a third person and incorporated in an individual contract without their 
content being discussed by the parties (see Article 2.1.19(2)). It is 
therefore logical that whenever the parties specifically negotiate and 
agree on particular provisions of their contract, such provisions will 
prevail over conflicting provisions contained in the standard terms 
Art. 2.1.22 
UNIDROIT Principles 
72 
since they are more likely to reflect the intention of the parties in the 
given case. 
The individually agreed provisions may appear in the same 
document as the standard terms, but may also be contained in a separate 
document. In the first case they may easily be recognised on account of 
their being written in characters different from those of the standard 
terms. In the second case it may be more difficult to distinguish between 
the provisions which are standard terms and those which are not, and to 
determine their exact position in the hierarchy of the different 
documents. To this effect the parties often include a contract provision 
expressly indicating the documents which form part of their contract and 
their respective weight. Special problems may however arise when the 
modifications to the standard terms have only been agreed upon orally, 
without the conflicting provisions contained in the standard terms being 
struck out, and those standard terms contain a provision stating the 
exclusive character of the writing signed by the parties, or that any 
addition to or modification of their content must be in writing. For these 
cases see Articles 2.1.17 and 2.1.18. 
ARTICLE  2.1.22 
(Battle of forms) 
Where both parties use standard terms and 
reach agreement except on those terms, a contract 
is concluded on the basis of the agreed terms and 
of any standard terms which are common in 
substance unless one party clearly indicates in 
advance, or later and without undue delay 
informs the other party, that it does not intend to 
be bound by such a contract. 
COMMENT 
1. Parties using different standard terms 
It is quite frequent in commercial transactions for both the offeror 
when making the offer, and the offeree when accepting it, each to refer 
to its own standard terms. In the absence of express acceptance by the 
offeror of the offeree’s standard terms, the problem arises as to whether 
a contract is concluded at all and if so, which, if either, of the two 
conflicting sets of standard terms should prevail. 
 
Formation 
Art. 2.1.22 
 
73 
2. “Battle of forms” and general rules on offer and acceptance 
If the general rules on offer and acceptance were to be applied, there 
would either be no contract at all since the purported acceptance by the 
offeree would, subject to the exception provided for in Article 2.1.11(2), 
amount to a counter-offer, or if the two parties have started to perform 
without objecting to each other’s standard terms, a contract would be 
considered to have been concluded on the basis of those terms which 
were the last to be sent or to be referred to (the “last shot”). 
3. The “knock-out” doctrine 
The “last shot” doctrine may be appropriate if the parties clearly 
indicate that the adoption of their standard terms is an essential 
condition for the conclusion of the contract. Where, on the other hand, 
the parties, as is very often the case in practice, refer to their standard 
terms more or less automatically, for example by exchanging printed 
order and acknowledgement of order forms with the respective terms on 
the reverse side, they will normally not even be aware of the conflict 
between their respective standard terms. There is in such cases no 
reason to allow the parties subsequently to question the very existence 
of the contract or, if performance has commenced, to insist on the 
application of the terms last sent or referred to. 
It is for this reason that this Article provides, notwithstanding the 
general rules on offer and acceptance, that if the parties reach an 
agreement except on their standard terms, a contract is concluded on the 
basis of the agreed terms and of any standard terms which are common 
in substance (“knock-out” doctrine). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A orders a machine from B indicating the type of machine, the 
price and terms of payment, and the date and place of delivery. A 
uses an order form with its “General Conditions for Purchase” 
printed on the reverse side. B accepts by sending an acknow-
ledgement of order form on the reverse side of which appear its own 
“General Conditions for Sale”. When A subsequently seeks to 
withdraw from the deal it claims that no contract was ever concluded 
as there was no agreement as to which set of standard terms should 
apply. Since, however, the parties have agreed on the essential terms 
of the contract, a contract has been concluded on those terms and on 
any standard terms which are common in substance. 
A party may, however, always exclude the operation of the “knock-
out” doctrine by clearly indicating in advance, or by later and without 
undue delay informing the other, that it does not intend to be bound by a 
Art. 2.1.22 
UNIDROIT Principles 
74 
contract which is not based on its own standard terms. What will in 
practice amount to such a “clear” indication cannot be stated in absolute 
terms but the inclusion of a clause of this kind in the standard terms 
themselves will not normally be sufficient since what is necessary is a 
specific declaration by the party concerned in its offer or acceptance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that A claims 
that the contract was concluded on the basis of its standard terms 
since they contain a clause which states that “Deviating standard 
terms of the party accepting the order are not valid if they have not 
been confirmed in writing by us”. The result will be the same as in 
Illustration 1, since merely by including such a clause in its standard 
terms A does not indicate with sufficient clarity its determination to 
conclude the contract only on its own terms. 
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the non-
standard terms of A’s offer contain a statement to the effect that A 
intends to contract only on its own standard terms. The mere fact that 
B attaches its own standard terms to its acceptance does not prevent 
the contract from being concluded on the basis of A’s standard 
terms.

SECTION  2: AUTHORITY OF AGENTS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  2.2.1 
(Scope of the Section) 
(1) This Section governs the authority of a 
person (“the agent”) to affect the legal relations of 
another person (“the principal”) by or with 
respect to a contract with a third party, whether 
the agent acts in its own name or in that of the 
principal. 
(2) It governs only the relations between 
the principal or the agent on the one hand, and 
the third party on the other. 
(3) It does not govern an agent’s authority 
conferred by law or the authority of an agent 
appointed by a public or judicial authority. 
COMMENT 
1.  Scope of the Section  
This Section governs the authority of an agent to affect the legal 
relations between its principal and a third party. In other words, it 
focuses on the external relations between the principal or the agent on 
the one hand and the third party on the other and is not concerned with 
the internal relations between the principal and the agent. Even those 
provisions which deal with issues affecting both the internal and the 
external relations (see, e.g., Articles 2.2.2 and 2.2.10 on the establish-
ment and termination of the agent’s authority, Article 2.2.7 on conflict 
of interests and Article 2.2.8 on sub-agency), consider those issues only 
with respect to their effects on the third party.  
The rights and duties as between principal and agent are governed by 
their agreement and the applicable law which, with respect to specific 
types of agency relationships such as those concerning so-called 
“commercial agents”, may provide mandatory rules for the protection of 
the agent. 
2. Authority to contract  
The Section deals only with agents who have authority to conclude 
contracts on behalf of their principals. Intermediaries whose task it is 
Art. 2.2.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
76 
merely to introduce two parties to one another with a view to their 
concluding a contract (e.g. real estate agents), or to negotiate contracts 
on behalf of a principal but who have no authority to bind the principal 
(as may be the case of commercial agents) are outside the scope of the 
Section. 
On the other hand, the wording “the authority […] to affect the legal 
relations of […] the principal by or with respect to a contract with a 
third party” used in paragraph (1) is to be understood in a broad sense, 
so as to comprise any act by the agent aimed at concluding a contract or 
which relates to its performance, including giving a notice to, or 
receiving it from, the third party.  
3. Irrelevant whether agent acts in its own name or in that of its 
principal  
Contrary to a number of legal systems that distinguish between 
“direct representation” and “indirect representation” depending on 
whether the agent acts in the principal’s name or in its own name, no 
such distinction is made in this Section. As to the distinction between 
“disclosed” and “undisclosed” agency, see Articles 2.2.3 and 2.2.4.  
4.  Voluntary nature of the relationship between principal and 
agent 
A further condition for the application of this Section is the voluntary 
nature of the relationship between principal and agent. Cases where the 
agent’s authority is conferred by law (e.g. in the field of family law, 
matrimonial property and succession), or is derived from judicial 
authorisation (e.g. acting for a person without capacity to act), are 
outside the scope of this Section. 
5. Agents of companies  
The authority of organs, officers or partners of a corporation, 
partnership or other entity, with or without legal personality, is tradi-
tionally governed by special rules, sometimes even of a mandatory 
character, which by virtue of their specific scope necessarily prevail 
over the general rules on the authority of agents laid down in this 
Section. Thus, for instance, if under the special rules governing the 
authority of its organs or officers a corporation is prevented from 
invoking any limitation to their authority against third parties, that 
corporation may not rely on Article 2.2.5(1) to claim that it is not bound 
by an act of its organs or officers that falls outside the scope of their 
authority.  
 
Authority of Agents 
Art. 2.2.1 
 
77 
On the other hand, as long as the general rules laid down in this 
Section do not conflict with the above-mentioned special rules on the 
authority of organs, officers or partners, they may well be applied in lieu 
of the latter. Thus, for instance, a third party seeking to demonstrate that 
the contract it has concluded with an officer of a corporation binds that 
corporation, may invoke either the special rules governing the authority of 
that corporation’s organs or officers or, as the case may be, the general 
rules on apparent authority laid down in Article 2.2.5(2). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, a Chief Executive Officer of company B incorporated in 
country X, has under the company’s articles authority to carry out all 
transactions falling within the company’s ordinary course of 
business. A enters into a contract with C that clearly falls outside the 
scope of B’s ordinary business. According to Section 35A of the 
Companies Act of country X, “[i]n favour of a person dealing with a 
company in good faith, the power of the Board of Directors to bind 
the company, or authorise others to do so, shall be deemed to be free 
of any limitation under the company’s constitution” and “[...] a 
person shall not be regarded as acting in bad faith by reason only of 
that person’s knowing that an act is beyond the powers of the 
directors under the company’s constitution [...]”. B is bound by the 
contract between A and C even if C knew or ought to have known of 
the limitations to A’s authority, and B may not rely on Article 
2.2.5(1) to claim the contrary. 
2.  
A, Managing Director of company B incorporated in country X, 
has been given by the Board of Directors of the company the 
authority to carry out all transactions falling within the company’s 
ordinary course of business except the hiring and dismissal of 
employees. A hires C as the new accountant of B’s branch in country 
Y. B refuses to be bound by this appointment on account of A’s lack 
of authority to hire employees. C may overcome B’s objection by 
invoking Section 35A of the Companies Act of country X. Yet C, 
who as a national of country Y may not be familiar with that special 
provision of the Companies Act of country X, may equally rely on 
the general rule on apparent authority laid down in Article 2.2.5(2) 
and claim that, in view of A’s position as Managing Director of B, it 
was reasonable for C to believe that A had the authority to hire 
employees.

ARTICLE  2.2.2 
(Establishment and scope of the  
authority of the agent) 
(1) The principal’s grant of authority to an 
agent may be express or implied. 
(2) The agent has authority to perform all 
acts necessary in the circumstances to achieve the 
purposes for which the authority was granted. 
COMMENT 
1. Express or implied grant of authority 
Paragraph (1) makes it clear that the granting of authority to the 
agent by the principal is not subject to any particular requirement of 
form and that it may be either express or implied. 
The most common case of express authority is a power of attorney, 
but the principal may also confer authority on the agent in an oral 
statement or written communication or, in the case of a corporate entity, 
in a resolution by its board of directors. The granting of express 
authority in writing has the obvious advantage of providing clear 
evidence of the existence and precise scope of the agent’s authority to 
all parties concerned (principal, agent and third parties). 
An implied authority exists whenever the principal’s intention to 
confer authority on an agent can be inferred from the principal’s 
conduct (e.g. the assigning of a particular task to the agent) or other 
circumstances of the case (e.g. the terms of the express authorisation, a 
particular course of dealing between the two parties or a general trade 
usage).

B appoints A as Manager of B’s apartment building. A has 
implied authority to conclude short term lease contracts relating to

2. Scope of the authority  
The broader the mandate conferred on the agent, the broader the 
scope of its authority. Accordingly, paragraph (2) makes it clear that the 
agent’s authority, unless otherwise provided by the principal in its 
authorisation, is not limited to its express terms, but extends to all acts

ARTICLE  2.2.3 
(Agency disclosed) 
(1) Where an agent acts within the scope 
of its authority and the third party knew or ought 
to have known that the agent was acting as an 
agent, the acts of the agent shall directly affect the 
legal relations between the principal and the third 
party and no legal relation is created between the 
agent and the third party.  
(2) However, the acts of the agent shall 
affect only the relations between the agent and the 
third party, where the agent with the consent of 
the principal undertakes to become the party to 
the contract. 
COMMENT 
1.  “Disclosed” agency 
With respect to the effects of the acts of the agent, this Section 
distinguishes between two basic situations: one in which the agent acts 
on behalf of a principal and within the scope of its authority and the 
third party knows or ought to know that the agent is acting as an agent, 
and the other in which the agent acts on behalf of a principal within the 
scope of its authority but the third party neither knows nor ought to 
know that the agent is acting as an agent. The first situation, which is the 
normal one, may be referred to as “disclosed” agency and is dealt with 
in this Article. 
Art. 2.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
80 
2.  Agent’s acts directly affect legal relations between principal and 
third party 
In the case of a “disclosed” agency, the rule is that the agent’s acts 
directly affect the principal’s legal position vis-à-vis the third party 
(paragraph (1)). Thus, a contract made by the agent directly binds the 
principal and the third party to each other. Likewise, any commu-
nication of intention that the agent makes to, or receives from, the third 
party affects the principal’s legal position as if the principal itself had 
made or received it.   
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, a sales representative for computer manufacturer B, accepts 
the order placed by university C for the purchase of a certain number 
of computers. The sales contract directly binds B vis-à-vis C with the 
result that it is B, and not A, who is under an obligation to deliver the 
goods to C and who is entitled to payment by C. 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that one of the 
computers delivered is defective. The notice of such defects given by 
C to A directly affects B. 
3. Acting in the principal’s name not necessary 
For the establishment of a direct relationship between the principal 
and the third party it is sufficient that the agent acts within the scope of 
its authority and that the third party knows or ought to know that the 
latter acts on behalf of another person. By contrast, it is as a rule not 
necessary for the agent to act in the principal’s name (see also Article 
2.2.1(1)). 
In practice, however, there might be cases in which it is in the 
agent’s own interest to indicate expressly the identity of the person on 
whose behalf it is acting. Thus, whenever the contract requires the 
signature of the parties, the agent is well advised not simply to sign in 
its own name, but to add language such as “for and on behalf of” 
followed by the principal’s name, so as to avoid any risk of being held 
personally liable under the contract.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. For the sales contract 
to directly bind B vis-à-vis C it is irrelevant whether A, when 
accepting C’s order over the telephone, acts in its own name or 
expressly states that it is accepting in the name of B.

Computer specialist A is contacted by research centre C with a 
view to creating a computer programme for a special database on 
 
Authority of Agents 
Art. 2.2.3 
 
81 
international case law. A, when signing the contract in its capacity as 
employee of software company B, should expressly state that it is 
acting on behalf of B. If A merely signs the contract without 
indicating B, C may hold A personally liable under the contract  
4. Agent undertakes to become party to the contract 
An agent, though openly acting on behalf of a principal, may 
exceptionally itself become party to the contract with the third party 
(paragraph (2)). This is the case, in particular, where a principal, who 
wants to remain anonymous, instructs the agent to act as a so-called 
“commission agent”, i.e. to deal with the third party in its own name 
without establishing any direct relation between the principal and the 
third party. This is also the case where the third party makes it clear that 
it does not intend to contract with anyone other than the agent and the 
agent, with the consent of the principal, agrees that it alone and not the 
principal will be bound by the contract. In both cases it will follow from 
the terms of the agreement between the principal and the agent that, 
once the agent has acquired its rights under the contract with the third 
party, it will transfer them to the principal. 
Entirely different is the case where the agent steps in and, in 
violation of its agreement with the principal, decides to become party to 
the contract with the third party. In so doing the agent no longer acts as 
an agent, and this case therefore falls outside the scope of this Section.

Dealer B, expecting a substantial increase in the price of wheat, 
decides to purchase a large quantity of wheat. B, wishing to remain 
anonymous, entrusts commission agent A with this task. Even 
though supplier C knows that A is purchasing on behalf of a 
principal, the purchase contract is binding on A and C and does not 
directly affect B’s legal position.  
6. 
Confirming house A, acting on behalf of overseas buyer B, 
places an order with supplier C for the purchase of certain goods. 
Since C, who does not know B, insists on A’s confirmation of B’s 
order, A accepts to be held liable itself vis-à-vis C. Even though C 
knows that A is purchasing on behalf of B, the purchase contract is 
binding on A and C and does not directly affect B’s legal position.

Dealer B instructs agent A to purchase a certain quantity of oil 
on its behalf. When A is about to conclude the contract with supplier 
C, the news arrives that the oil producing countries intend to reduce 
production substantially. A, expecting a rise in oil prices, decides to 
purchase the oil on its own behalf and enters into the contract with C 
as the only other party. In so doing A has ceased to act as agent for 
the principal and the consequences of its acts are no longer governed 
by this Section. 
ARTICLE  2.2.4 
(Agency undisclosed) 
(1) Where an agent acts within the scope 
of its authority and the third party neither knew 
nor ought to have known that the agent was 
acting as an agent, the acts of the agent shall 
affect only the relations between the agent and the 
third party. 
(2) However, where such an agent, when 
contracting with the third party on behalf of a 
business, represents itself to be the owner of that 
business, the third party, upon discovery of the 
real owner of the business, may exercise also 
against the latter the rights it has against the 
agent.  
COMMENT 
1. “Undisclosed” agency 
This Article deals with what may be referred to as “undisclosed” 
agency, i.e. the situation where an agent acts within the scope of its 
authority on behalf of a principal but the third party neither knows nor 
ought to know that the agent is acting as an agent.  
2. Agent’s acts directly affect only the relations between agent and 
third party 
Paragraph (1) provides that in the case of an “undisclosed” agency 
the agent’s acts affect only the relations between the agent and the third 
party and do not directly bind the principal vis-à-vis the third party.

Art dealer A purchases a painting from artist C. When entering 
into the contract A does not disclose the fact that it is acting on behalf 
of client B, nor has C any reason to believe that A is not acting on its 
own behalf. The contract is binding on A and C only, and does not 
give rise to a direct relationship between B and C. 
3. Third party’s right of action against principal 
Notwithstanding the rule laid down in paragraph (1), the third party 
may exceptionally have a right of direct action also against the principal. 
More precisely, according to paragraph (2), if the third party believes 
that it is dealing with the owner of a business while in fact it is dealing 
with the owner’s agent, it may, upon discovery of the real owner, 
exercise also against the owner the rights it has against the agent.

action also against that company. 
ARTICLE  2.2.5 
(Agent acting without or exceeding its authority) 
(1) Where an agent acts without authority 
or exceeds its authority, its acts do not affect the 
legal relations between the principal and the third 
party. 
(2) However, where the principal causes 
the third party reasonably to believe that the 
agent has authority to act on behalf of the 
principal and that the agent is acting within the 
scope of that authority, the principal may not 
invoke against the third party the lack of 
authority of the agent. 
Art. 2.2.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
84 
COMMENT 
1. Lack of authority 
Paragraph (1) expressly states that where an agent acts without 
authority, its acts do not bind the principal and the third party to each 
other. The same applies to the case where the agent has been granted 
authority of limited scope and acts exceeding its authority. 
As to the liability of the false agent vis-à-vis the third party, see 
Article 2.2.6. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
1. 
Principal B authorises agent A to buy on its behalf a specific 
quantity of grain but without exceeding a certain price. A enters into 
a contract with seller C for the purchase of a greater quantity of grain 
and at a higher price than that authorised by B. On account of A’s 
lack of authority, the contract between A and C does not bind B, nor 
does it become effective between A and C. 
2. Apparent authority 
There are two cases in which an agent, though acting without 
authority or exceeding its authority, may bind the principal and the third 
party to each other.  
The first case occurs whenever the principal ratifies the agent’s act 
and is dealt with in Article 2.2.9. 
The second case is that of so-called “apparent authority” and is dealt 
with in paragraph (2) of this Article. According to this provision a 
principal, whose conduct leads a third party reasonably to believe that 
the agent has authority to act on its behalf, is prevented from invoking 
against the third party the lack of authority of the agent and is therefore 
bound by the latter’s act.  
Apparent authority, which is an application of the general principle 
of good faith (see Article 1.7) and of the prohibition of inconsistent 
behaviour (see Article 1.8), is especially important if the principal is not 
an individual but an organisation. In dealing with a corporation, 
partnership or other business association a third party may find it 
difficult to determine whether the persons acting for the organisation 
have actual authority to do so and may therefore prefer, whenever 
possible, to rely on their apparent authority. For this purpose the third 
party only has to demonstrate that it was reasonable for it to believe that 
the person purporting to represent the organisation was authorised 
 
Authority of Agents 
Art. 2.2.6 
 
85 
to do so, and that this belief was caused by the conduct of those actually 
authorised to represent the organisation (Board of Directors, executive 
officers, partners, etc.). Whether or not the third party’s belief was 
reasonable will depend on the circumstances of the case (position 
occupied by the apparent agent in the organisation’s hierarchy, type of 
transaction involved, acquiescence of the organisation’s representatives 
in the past, etc.). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
2. 
A, a manager of one of company B’s branch offices, though 
lacking actual authority to do so, engages construction company C to 
redecorate the branch’s premises. In view of the fact that a branch 
manager normally would have authority to enter into such a contract, 
B is bound by the contract with C since it was reasonable for C to 
believe that A had actual authority to enter into the contract.  
3. 
A, Chief Financial Officer of company B, though lacking 
authority to do so, has, with the acquiescence of the Board of 
Directors, repeatedly entered into financial transactions with bank C 
on behalf of B. On the occasion of a new transaction which proves to 
be disadvantageous to B, B’s Board of Directors raises against C the 
objection of A’s lack of authority. C may defeat this objection by 
claiming that B is bound by A’s apparent authority to enter into the 
financial transaction on B’s behalf. 
ARTICLE  2.2.6 
(Liability of agent acting without or  
exceeding its authority) 
(1) An agent that acts without authority or 
exceeds its authority is, failing ratification by the 
principal, liable for damages that will place the 
third party in the same position as if the agent 
had acted with authority and not exceeded its 
authority.  
(2) However, the agent is not liable if the 
third party knew or ought to have known that the 
agent had no authority or was exceeding its 
authority.

COMMENT 
1. Liability of false agent 
It is generally recognised that an agent acting without authority or 
exceeding its authority shall, failing ratification by the principal, be 
liable for damages to the third party. Paragraph (1), in stating that the 
false agent shall be liable to pay the third party such compensation as 
will place the third party in the same position as it would have been in 
if the agent had acted with authority, makes it clear that the liability of 
the false agent is not limited to the so-called reliance or negative 
interest, but extends to the so-called expectation or positive interest. In 
other words, the third party may recover the profit that would have 
resulted if the contract concluded with the false agent had been a valid 
one.

Agent A, without being authorised by principal B, enters into a 
contract with third party C for the sale of a cargo of oil belonging to 
B. Failing B’s ratification of the contract, C may recover from A the 
difference between the contract price and the current market price. 
2.  Third party’s knowledge of agent’s lack of authority 
The false agent is liable to the third party only to the extent that the 
third party, when entering into the contract with the false agent, neither 
knew nor ought to have known that the latter was acting without 
authority or exceeding its authority. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
2. 
A, a junior employee of company B, without having authority 
to do so engages construction company C to redecorate B’s

request damages from A since it should have known that an 
employee of A’s rank normally has no authority to enter into such a 
contract.

ARTICLE  2.2.7 
(Conflict of interests) 
(1) If a contract concluded by an agent 
involves the agent in a conflict of interests with 
the principal of which the third party knew or 
ought to have known, the principal may avoid the 
contract. The right to avoid is subject to Articles 
3.2.9 and 3.2.11 to 3.2.15. 
(2) However, the principal may not avoid 
the contract 
(a) if the principal had consented to, or 
knew or ought to have known of, the agent’s 
involvement in the conflict of interests; or 
(b) if the agent had disclosed the conflict of 
interests to the principal and the latter had not 
objected within a reasonable time.  
COMMENT 
1. Conflict of interests between agent and principal 
It is inherent in any agency relationship that the agent, in fulfilling its 
mandate, will act in the interest of the principal and not in its own 
interest or in that of anyone else if there is a conflict between such an 
interest and that of the principal. 
The most frequent cases of potential conflict of interests are those 
where the agent acts for two principals and those where the agent 
concludes the contract with itself or with a firm in which it has an 
interest. However, in practice even in such cases a real conflict of 
interests may not exist. Thus, for instance, the agent’s acting for two 
principals may be in conformity with the usages of the trade sector 
concerned, or the principal may have conferred on the agent a mandate 
which is so stringent as to leave it no margin for manoeuvre.  
2. Conflict of interests as grounds for avoidance of the contract 
Paragraph (1) of this Article lays down the rule that a contract 
concluded by an agent acting in a situation of real conflict of interests 
may be avoided by the principal, provided that the third party knew or 
ought to have known of the conflict of interests.   
The requirement of the actual or constructive knowledge of the third 
party is intended to protect the innocent third party’s interest in 
Art. 2.2.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
88 
preserving the contract. This requirement is obviously no longer 
relevant where the agent concludes the contract with itself and is 
therefore at one and the same time agent and third party.   
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Solicitor A is requested by foreign client B to purchase on its 
behalf an apartment in A’s city. A buys an apartment client C has 
requested A to sell on its behalf. B may avoid the contract if it can 
prove that C knew or ought to have known of A’s conflict of 
interests. Likewise, C may avoid the contract if it can prove that B 
knew or ought to have known of A’s conflict of interests. 
2. 
Sales agent A, requested by retailer B to purchase certain goods 
on its behalf, purchases the goods from company C in which A is a 
majority shareholder. B may avoid the contract if it can prove that C 
knew or ought to have known of A’s conflict of interests.  
3. 
Client B instructs bank A to buy on its behalf one thousand 
shares of company C at the closing price of day M on the stock 
exchange of city Y. Even if A sells B the requested shares from out 
of those it has in its own portfolio, there can be no conflict of 
interests because B’s mandate leaves A no margin for manoeuvre. 
4. 
A, Chief Executive Officer of company B, has authority to 
appoint the company’s counsel in the event of a law suit being 
brought by or against B. A appoints itself as B’s counsel. B may 
avoid the contract. 
3. Procedure for avoidance 
As to the procedure for avoidance, the provisions laid down in 
Articles 3.2.9 (Confirmation), 3.2.11 (Notice of avoidance), 3.2.12 
(Time limits), 3.2.13 (Partial avoidance), 3.2.14 (Retroactive effect of 
avoidance) and 3.2.15 (Restitution) apply. 
4. Avoidance excluded 
According to paragraph (2), the principal loses its right to avoid the 
contract if it has given its prior consent to the agent’s acting in a 
situation of conflict of interests, or at any rate knew or ought to have 
known that the agent would do so. The right of avoidance is likewise 
excluded if the principal, having been informed by the agent of the 
contract it has concluded in a situation of conflict of interests, raises no 
objection.

The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that before 
concluding the contract A duly informs B that it is acting as agent also

Likewise, if A duly informs C that it is acting as agent also for B and 
C does not object, C loses its right to avoid the contract.  
5.  Issues not covered by this Article  
In conformity with the scope of this Section set out in Article 2.2.1, 
this Article addresses only the impact that the agent’s involvement in a 
conflict of interests situation may have on the external relationship. 
Issues such as the agent’s duty of full disclosure vis-à-vis the principal 
and the principal’s right to damages from the agent may be settled on 
the basis of other provisions of the Principles (see Articles 1.7, 3.2.16, 
7.4.1 et seq.) or are otherwise governed by the law applicable to the 
internal relationship between principal and agent. 
ARTICLE  2.2.8 
(Sub-agency) 
An agent has implied authority to appoint a 
sub-agent to perform acts which it is not 
reasonable to expect the agent to perform itself. 
The rules of this Section apply to the sub-agency. 
COMMENT 
1. Role of sub-agents 
In carrying out the mandate conferred on it by the principal, an agent 
may find it convenient or even necessary to avail itself of the services of 
other persons. This is the case, for instance, where certain tasks are to be 
performed in a place distant from the agent’s place of business, or if a 
more efficient performance of the agent’s mandate requires distribution 
of work. 
2. Implied authority to appoint sub-agents 
Whether or not the agent is authorised to appoint one or more sub-
agents depends on the terms of the authority granted by the principal. 
Art. 2.2.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
90 
Thus, the principal may expressly exclude the appointment of sub-
agents or make it conditional upon its prior approval. If nothing is said 
in the authorisation as to the possibility of appointing sub-agents and the 
terms of the authority granted are not otherwise inconsistent with such a 
possibility, the agent has the right under this Article to appoint sub-
agents. The only limitation is that the agent may not entrust the sub-
agent(s) with tasks that it is reasonable to expect the agent itself to 
perform. This is the case in particular of acts requiring the agent’s 
personal expertise. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Chinese museum B instructs a London-based art dealer A to 
buy a particular piece of Greek pottery on sale at a private auction in 
Germany. A has implied authority to appoint German sub-agent S to 
purchase that piece of pottery at the auction in Germany and to send 
it to B.  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B does 
not specify the particular piece of Greek pottery to be acquired at the 
auction in Germany as it relies on A’s expertise to choose the most 
suitable item offered for sale. A is expected to make the purchase at 
the auction itself, but once it has purchased the piece of pottery, it 
may appoint sub-agent S to send it to B.   
3. Effects of a sub-agent’s acts 
This Article expressly states that the rules of this Section apply to the 
sub-agency. In other words, the acts of a sub-agent legitimately 
appointed by the agent bind the principal and the third party to each 
other, provided that those acts are within both the agent’s authority and 
the authority conferred on the sub-agent by the agent, which may be 
more limited. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. The purchase of the 
piece of Greek pottery by S directly binds B provided that it is within 
both the authority that B has granted to A and the authority that A 
has granted to S. 
 
Authority of Agents 
Art. 2.2.9 
 
91 
ARTICLE  2.2.9 
(Ratification) 
(1) An act by an agent that acts without 
authority or exceeds its authority may be ratified 
by the principal. On ratification the act produces 
the same effects as if it had initially been carried 
out with authority. 
(2) The third party may by notice to the 
principal specify a reasonable period of time for 
ratification. If the principal does not ratify within 
that period of time it can no longer do so. 
(3) If, at the time of the agent’s act, the 
third party neither knew nor ought to have 
known of the lack of authority, it may, at any 
time before ratification, by notice to the principal 
indicate its refusal to become bound by a 
ratification.  
COMMENT 
1. Notion of ratification 
This Article lays down the generally accepted principle whereby acts 
which have no effect on the principal because they have been carried out 
by an agent holding itself out to have authority but actually without 
authority or exceeding its authority, may be authorised by the principal 
at a later stage. Such subsequent authorisation is known as 
“ratification”.  
Like the original authorisation, ratification is not subject to any 
requirement as to form. As it is a unilateral manifestation of intent, it 
may be either express or implied from words or conduct and, though 
normally communicated to the agent, to the third party, or to both, it 
need not be communicated to anyone, provided that it is manifested in 
some way and can therefore be ascertained by probative material. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
Agent A purchases on behalf of principal B goods from third party C 
at a price higher than that which A is authorised to pay. Upon receipt 
of C’s bill, B makes no objection and pays it by bank transfer. The 
payment amounts to ratification of A’s act even if B does not 
expressly declare its intention to ratify, fails to inform 
Art. 2.2.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
92 
both A and C of the payment and C is only subsequently informed of 
the payment by its bank. 
2. Effects of ratification 
On ratification the agent’s acts produce the same effects as if they 
had been carried out with authority from the outset (paragraph (1)). It 
follows that the third party may refuse partial ratification of the agent’s 
acts by the principal as it would amount to a proposal by the principal to 
modify the contract that the third party has concluded with the agent. In 
turn, the principal may not revoke ratification after it has been brought 
to the attention of the third party. Otherwise the principal would be in a 
position to withdraw unilaterally from the contract with the third party. 
3. Time of ratification 
The principal may in principle ratify at any time. The reason for this 
is that normally the third party does not even know that it has contracted 
with an agent who did not have authority or who exceeded its authority. 
However, even if the third party knows from the outset, or subsequently 
becomes aware, that the agent was a false agent, it will have a legitimate 
interest not to be left in doubt indefinitely as to the ultimate fate of the 
contract concluded with the false agent. Accordingly, paragraph (2) 
grants the third party the right to set a reasonable time limit within 
which the principal must ratify if it intends to do so. It goes without 
saying that in such a case ratification must be notified to the third party. 
4.  Ratification excluded by third party 
A third party, who when dealing with the agent neither knew nor 
ought to have known of that agent’s lack of authority, may exclude 
ratification by giving the principal notice to this effect any time before 
ratification by the latter. The reason for granting the innocent third party 
such a right is to avoid that the principal is the only one in a position to 
speculate and to decide whether or not to ratify depending on market 
developments. 
5. Third persons’ rights not affected 
This Article deals only with the effects of ratification on the three 
parties directly involved in the agency relationship, i.e. the principal, the 
agent and the third party. In accordance with the scope of this 
 
Authority of Agents 
Art. 2.2.10 
 
93 
Section as defined in Article 2.2.1, the rights of other third persons are 
not affected. For instance, if the same goods have been sold first by the 
false agent to C, and subsequently by the principal to another person D, 
the conflict between C and D as a result of the principal’s subsequent 
ratification of the first sale will have to be solved by the applicable law. 
ARTICLE  2.2.10 
(Termination of authority) 
(1) Termination 
of 
authority 
is 
not 
effective in relation to the third party unless the 
third party knew or ought to have known of it. 
(2) Notwithstanding the termination of its 
authority, an agent remains authorised to 
perform the acts that are necessary to prevent 
harm to the principal’s interests. 
COMMENT 
1.  Grounds for termination not covered by this Article 
There are several grounds on which the agent’s authority may be 
terminated: revocation by the principal, renunciation by the agent, 
completion of the act(s) for which authority had been granted, loss of 
capacity, bankruptcy, death or cessation of the existence of the principal 
or the agent, etc. What exactly constitutes a ground for termination and 
the way it operates as between the principal and the agent falls outside 
the scope of this Article and is to be determined in accordance with the 
applicable laws (e.g. the law governing the internal relations between 
principal and agent, the law governing their legal status or personality, 
the law governing bankruptcy, etc.) which may vary considerably from 
one country to another. 
2. Termination effective vis-à-vis third party 
Whatever the grounds for termination of the agent’s authority, in 
relation to the third party termination is not effective unless the third 
party knew or ought to have known of it (paragraph (1)). In other words, 
even if the agent’s authority has been terminated for one reason or 
another, the agent’s acts continue to affect the legal relationship 
Art. 2.2.10 
UNIDROIT Principles 
94 
between the principal and the third party as long as the third party is 
neither aware of nor ought to know that the agent no longer has 
authority. 
Obviously the situation is clear whenever either the principal or the 
agent gives the third party notice of the termination. In the absence of 
such notice it will depend on the circumstances of the case whether the 
third party ought to have known of the termination. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Principal B opens a branch office in city X. An advertisement 
published in the local newspaper indicates Managing Director A as 
having full authority to act on behalf of B. When B subsequently 
revokes A’s authority, a similar notice thereof in the same newspaper 
is sufficient to make the termination effective vis-à-vis B’s 
customers in city X.  
2. 
Retailer C has repeatedly placed orders with sales represent-
ative A for the purchase of goods sold by principal B. A continues to 
accept orders from C even after its authority has been terminated on 
account of B’s bankruptcy. The mere fact that the bankruptcy 
proceedings were given the publicity required by the applicable law 
is not sufficient to make the termination effective vis-à-vis C. 
3. Authority of necessity 
Even after termination of the agent’s authority the circumstances of 
the case may make it necessary for the agent to perform additional acts 
in order to prevent the principal’s interests from being harmed.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Agent A has authority to purchase a certain quantity of 
perishable goods on behalf of principal B. After the purchase of the 
goods A is informed of B’s death. Notwithstanding the termination 
of its authority, A continues to be authorised either to resell the 
goods or to store them in a suitable warehouse. 
4. Restriction of authority also covered  
The rules of this Article apply not only to termination but, with 
appropriate modifications, also to subsequent restrictions of an agent’s 
authority.

VALIDITY 
 
 
 
SECTION  1: GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  3.1.1 
(Matters not covered) 
This Chapter does not deal with lack of 
capacity. 
COMMENT 
This Article makes it clear that not all the grounds of invalidity of a 
contract to be found in the various national legal systems fall within the 
scope of the Principles. This is in particular the case of lack of capacity. 
The reason for its exclusion lies in both the inherent complexity of 
questions of status and the extremely diverse manner in which these 
questions are treated in domestic law. In consequence, matters such as 
ultra vires will continue to be governed by the applicable law.  
As to the authority of organs, officers or partners of a corporation, 
partnership or other entities to bind their respective entities, see 
Comment 5 on Article 2.2.1. 
ARTICLE  3.1.2 
(Validity of mere agreement) 
A contract is concluded, modified or ter-
minated by the mere agreement of the parties, 
without any further requirement. 
Art. 3.1.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
96 
COMMENT 
The purpose of this Article is to make it clear that the mere 
agreement of the parties is sufficient for the valid conclusion, 
modification or termination by agreement of a contract, without any of 
the further requirements which are to be found in some domestic laws. 
1. No need for consideration 
In common law systems, “consideration” is traditionally seen as a 
prerequisite for the validity or enforceability of a contract, as well as for 
the modification or termination of a contract by the parties. 
However, in commercial dealings this requirement is of minimal 
practical importance since in that context obligations are almost always 
undertaken by both parties. It is for this reason that Article 29(1) CISG 
dispenses with the requirement of consideration in relation to the 
modification and termination by the parties of contracts for the 
international sale of goods. The fact that this Article extends this 
approach to the conclusion, modification and termination by the parties 
of international commercial contracts in general can only bring about 
greater certainty and reduce litigation. 
2. No need for cause 
This Article also excludes the requirement of “cause” which exists in 
some civil law systems and is in certain respects functionally similar to 
the common law “consideration”.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
At the request of its French customer A, bank B in Paris issues 
a guarantee on first demand in favour of C, a business partner of A in 
England. Neither B nor A can invoke the possible absence of 
consideration or cause for the guarantee. 
It should be noted, however, that this Article is not concerned with 
the effects which may derive from other aspects of cause, such as its 
illegality (see Comment 2 on Article 3.3.1). 
3. All contracts consensual 
Some civil law systems have retained certain types of “real” contract, 
i.e. contracts concluded only upon the actual handing over of the goods 
concerned. These rules are not easily compatible with modern
 
Validity 
Art. 3.1.3 
 
97 
business perceptions and practice and are therefore excluded by this 
Article. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
Two French businessmen, A and B, agree with C, a real estate 
developer, to lend C EUR 300,000 on 2 July. On 25 June, A and B 
inform C that, unexpectedly, they need the money for their own 
business. C is entitled to receive the loan, although the loan is 
generally considered a “real” contract in France.  
ARTICLE  3.1.3 
(Initial impossibility) 
(1) The mere fact that at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract the performance of the 
obligation assumed was impossible does not affect 
the validity of the contract. 
(2) The mere fact that at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract a party was not entitled 
to dispose of the assets to which the contract 
relates does not affect the validity of the contract. 
COMMENT 
1. Performance impossible from the outset 
Contrary to a number of legal systems which consider a contract of 
sale void if the specific goods sold have already perished at the time of 
conclusion of the contract, paragraph (1) of this Article, in conformity 
with the most modern trends, states in general terms that the mere fact 
that at the time of the conclusion of the contract the performance of the 
obligation assumed was impossible does not affect the validity of the 
contract. 
A contract is valid even if the assets to which it relates have already 
perished at the time of contracting, with the consequence that initial 
impossibility of performance is equated with impossibility occurring after 
the conclusion of the contract. The rights and duties of the parties arising 
from one party’s (or possibly even both parties’) inability to perform are 
to be determined according to the rules on non-performance. Under these 
rules appropriate weight may be attached, for example, to the fact that the 
obligor (or the obligee) already knew of the impossibility of performance 
at the time of contracting. The rule laid down in paragraph (1) also 
Art. 3.1.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
98 
removes possible doubts as to the validity of contracts for the delivery of 
future goods.  
If an initial impossibility of performance is due to a legal prohibition 
(e.g. an export or import embargo), the validity of the contract depends 
upon whether under the law enacting the prohibition the latter is 
intended to invalidate the contract or merely to prohibit its performance. 
Paragraph (1) moreover departs from the rule to be found in some 
civil law systems according to which the object (objet) of a contract 
must be possible. 
The paragraph also deviates from the rule of the same systems which 
requires the existence of a cause, since, in a case of initial impossibility, 
the cause for a counter-performance is lacking (see Article 3.1.2). 
2. Lack of legal title or power 
Paragraph (2) of this Article deals with cases where the party 
promising to transfer or deliver assets was not entitled to dispose of the 
assets because it lacked legal title or the right of disposition at the time 
of the conclusion of the contract.  
Some legal systems declare a contract of sale concluded in such 
circumstances to be void. Yet, as in the case with initial impossibility, 
and for even more cogent reasons, paragraph (2) of this Article 
considers such a contract to be valid. Indeed, a contracting party may, 
and often does, acquire legal title to, or the power of disposition over, 
the assets in question after the conclusion of the contract. Should this 
not occur, the rules on non-performance will apply.  
Cases where the power of disposition is lacking must be 
distinguished from those of lack of capacity. The latter relate to certain 
disabilities of a person which may affect all or at least some types of 
contract concluded by it, and falls outside the scope of the Principles 
(see Article 3.1.1). 
 
Validity 
Art. 3.1.4 
 
99 
ARTICLE  3.1.4 
(Mandatory character of the provisions) 
The provisions on fraud, threat, gross 
disparity and illegality contained in this Chapter 
are mandatory. 
COMMENT 
The provisions of this Chapter relating to fraud, threat, gross 
disparity and illegality are of a mandatory character. It would be 
contrary to good faith for the parties to exclude or modify these 
provisions when concluding their contract. However, nothing prevents 
the party entitled to avoidance for fraud, threat and gross disparity to 
waive that right once that party learns of the true facts or is able to act 
freely. 
On the other hand, the provisions of this Chapter relating to the 
binding force of a mere agreement, to initial impossibility or to mistake 
are not mandatory. Thus the parties may reintroduce special 
requirements of domestic law, such as consideration or cause. They may 
likewise agree that their contract shall be invalid in case of initial 
impossibility, or that mistake by one of the parties is not a ground for 
avoidance. 
 
100 
SECTION  2: GROUNDS FOR AVOIDANCE 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  3.2.1 
(Definition of mistake) 
Mistake 
is 
an 
erroneous 
assumption 
relating to facts or to law existing when the 
contract was concluded. 
COMMENT 
1. Mistake of fact and mistake of law 
This Article equates a mistake relating to facts with a mistake 
relating to law. Identical legal treatment of the two types of mistake 
seems justified in view of the increasing complexity of modern legal 
systems. For cross-border trade the difficulties caused by this 
complexity are exacerbated by the fact that an individual transaction 
may be affected by foreign and therefore unfamiliar legal systems. 
2. Decisive time 
This Article indicates that a mistake must involve an erroneous 
assumption relating to the factual or legal circumstances that exist at the 
time of the conclusion of the contract.  
The purpose of fixing this time element is to distinguish cases where 
the rules on mistake with their particular remedies apply from those 
relating to non-performance. Indeed, a typical case of mistake may, 
depending on the point of view taken, often just as well be seen as one 
involving an obstacle which prevents or impedes the performance of the 
contract. If a party has entered into a contract under a misconception as 
to the factual or legal context and therefore misjudged its prospects 
under that contract, the rules on mistake will apply. If, on the other 
hand, a party has a correct understanding of the surrounding 
circumstances but makes an error of judgment as to its prospects under 
the contract, and later refuses to perform, then the case is one of non-
performance rather than mistake. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.2 
 
101 
ARTICLE  3.2.2 
(Relevant mistake) 
(1) A party may only avoid the contract 
for mistake if, when the contract was concluded, 
the mistake was of such importance that a 
reasonable person in the same situation as the 
party in error would only have concluded the 
contract on materially different terms or would 
not have concluded it at all if the true state of 
affairs had been known, and 
(a) the other party made the same mistake, 
or caused the mistake, or knew or ought to have 
known of the mistake and it was contrary to 
reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing 
to leave the mistaken party in error; or 
(b) the other party had not at the time of 
avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on the 
contract. 
(2) However, a party may not avoid the 
contract if  
(a) it was grossly negligent in committing 
the mistake; or 
(b) the mistake relates to a matter in 
regard to which the risk of mistake was assumed 
or, having regard to the circumstances, should be 
borne by the mistaken party. 
COMMENT 
This Article states the conditions necessary for a mistake to be 
relevant with a view to avoidance of the contract. The introductory part 
of paragraph (1) determines the conditions under which a mistake is 
sufficiently serious to be taken into account; sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of paragraph (1) add the conditions regarding the party other than the 
mistaken party; paragraph (2) deals with the conditions regarding the 
mistaken party. 
1. Serious mistake 
To be relevant, a mistake must be serious. Its weight and importance 
are to be assessed by reference to a combined objective/subjective 
standard, namely what “a reasonable person in the same situation as 
Art. 3.2.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
102 
the party in error” would have done if it had known the true 
circumstances at the time of the conclusion of the contract. If it would 
not have contracted at all, or would have done so only on materially 
different terms, then, and only then, is the mistake considered to be 
serious. 
In this context the introductory part of paragraph (1) relies on an 
open-ended formula, rather than indicating specific essential elements of 
the contract to which the mistake must relate. This flexible approach 
allows full account to be taken of the intentions of the parties and the 
circumstances of the case. In ascertaining the parties’ intentions, the 
rules of interpretation laid down in Chapter 4 must be applied. General 
commercial standards and relevant usages will be particularly important. 
Normally in commercial transactions certain mistakes, such as those 
concerning the value of goods or services or mere expectations or 
motivations of the mistaken party, are not considered to be relevant. The 
same is true of mistakes as to the identity of the other party or its 
personal qualities, although special circumstances may sometimes 
render such mistakes relevant (e.g. when services to be rendered require 
certain personal qualifications or when a loan is based upon the credit-
worthiness of the borrower).  
The fact that a reasonable person would consider the circumstances 
erroneously assumed to be essential is however not sufficient, since 
additional requirements concerning both the mistaken and the other 
party must be met if a mistake is to become relevant. 
2. Conditions concerning the party other than the mistaken party 
A mistaken party may avoid the contract only if the other party 
satisfies one of four conditions laid down in paragraph (1).  
The first three conditions indicated in sub-paragraph (a) have in 
common the fact that the other party does not deserve protection 
because of its involvement in one way or another with the mistaken 
party’s error.  
The first condition is that both parties laboured under the same 
mistake.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A and B, when concluding a contract for the sale of a sports 
car, were not and could not have been aware of the fact that the car 
had in the meantime been stolen. Avoidance of the contract is 
admissible. 
However, if the parties erroneously believe the object of the contract 
to be in existence at the time of the conclusion of the contract, while in 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.2 
 
103 
reality it had already been destroyed, Article 3.1.3 has to be taken into 
account. 
The second condition is that the error of the mistaken party is caused 
by the other party. This is the case whenever the error can be traced to 
specific representations made by the latter party, be they express or 
implied, negligent or innocent, or to conduct which in the circumstances 
amounts to a representation. Even silence may cause an error. A mere 
“puff” in advertising or in negotiations will normally be tolerated. 
If the error was caused intentionally, Article 3.2.5 applies. 
The third condition is that the other party knew or ought to have 
known of the error of the mistaken party and that it was contrary to 
reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing to leave the mistaken 
party in error. What the other party ought to have known is what should 
have been known to a reasonable person in the same situation as that 
party. In order to avoid the contract the mistaken party must also show 
that the other party was under a duty to inform it of its error. 
The fourth condition is laid down in sub-paragraph (b) and is that the 
party other than the mistaken party had not, up to the time of avoidance, 
reasonably acted in reliance on the contract. For the time of avoidance, 
see Articles 3.2.12 and 1.10. 
3. Conditions concerning the mistaken party 
Paragraph (2) of this Article mentions two cases in which the 
mistaken party may not avoid the contract. 
The first of these, dealt with in sub-paragraph (a), is that the error is 
due to the gross negligence of the mistaken party. In such a situation it 
would be unfair to the other party to allow the mistaken party to avoid 
the contract. 
Sub-paragraph (b) contemplates the situation where the mistaken 
party either has assumed the risk of mistake or where this risk should in 
the circumstances be borne by it. An assumption of the risk of mistake is 
a frequent feature of speculative contracts. A party may conclude a 
contract in the hope that its assumption of the existence of certain facts 
will prove to be correct, but may nevertheless undertake to assume the 
risk of this not being so. In such circumstances it will not be entitled to 
avoid the contract for its mistake.  
Art. 3.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
104 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A sells to B a picture “attributed” to the relatively unknown 
painter C at a fair price for such paintings. It is subsequently 
discovered that the work was painted by the famous artist D. A 
cannot avoid its contract with B on the ground of its mistake, since 
the fact that the picture was only “attributed” to C implied the risk 
that it might have been painted by a more famous artist. 
Sometimes both parties assume a risk. However, speculative 
contracts involving conflicting expectations of future developments, e.g. 
those concerning prices and exchange rates, may not be avoided on the 
ground of mistake, since the mistake would not be one as to facts 
existing at the time of the conclusion of the contract.  
ARTICLE  3.2.3 
(Error in expression or transmission) 
An error occurring in the expression or 
transmission of a declaration is considered to be a 
mistake of the person from whom the declaration 
emanated. 
COMMENT 
This Article equates an error in the expression or transmission of a 
declaration with an ordinary mistake of the person making the 
declaration or sending it and thus the rules of Article 3.1.4, Article 3.2.2 
and Articles 3.2.9 to 3.2.16 apply also to these kinds of error. 
1. Relevant mistake 
If an error in expression or transmission is of sufficient magnitude 
(especially if it has resulted in the misstatement of figures), the receiver 
will be, or ought to be, aware of the error. Since nothing in the 
Principles prevents the receiver/offeree from accepting the erroneously 
expressed or transmitted offer, it is for the sender/offeror to invoke the 
error and to avoid the contract provided that the conditions of Article 
3.2.2 are met, in particular that it was contrary to reasonable commercial 
standards of fair dealing for the receiver/offeree not to inform the 
sender/offeror of the error. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.4 
 
105 
In some cases the risk of the error may have been assumed by, or 
may have to be imposed upon, the sender if it uses a method of 
transmission which it knows or ought to know to be unsafe either in 
general or in the special circumstances of the case. 
2. Mistakes on the part of the receiver 
Transmission ends as soon as the message reaches the receiver (see 
Article 1.10). 
If the message is correctly transmitted, but the receiver misunder-
stands its content, the case falls outside the scope of this Article. 
If the message is correctly transmitted to the receiver’s machine 
which, however, due to a technical fault, prints out a mutilated text, the 
case is again outside the scope of this Article. The same is true if, at the 
receiver’s request, a message is given orally to the receiver’s messenger 
who misunderstands it or transmits it wrongly. 
In the two above-mentioned situations the receiver may however be 
entitled to invoke its own mistake in accordance with Article 3.2.2, if it 
replies to the sender and bases its reply upon its own misunderstanding 
of the sender’s message and if all the conditions of Article 3.2.2 are met. 
ARTICLE  3.2.4 
(Remedies for non-performance) 
A party is not entitled to avoid the contract 
on the ground of mistake if the circumstances on 
which that party relies afford, or could have 
afforded, a remedy for non-performance. 
COMMENT 
1. Remedies for non-performance preferred 
This Article is intended to resolve the conflict which may arise 
between the remedy of avoidance for mistake and the remedies for non-
performance. In the event of such a conflict, preference is given to the 
remedies for non-performance since they seem to be better suited and 
are more flexible than the radical solution of avoidance. 
Art. 3.2.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
106 
2. Actual and potential conflicts 
An actual conflict between the remedies for mistake and those for 
non-performance arises whenever the two sets of remedies are invoked 
in relation to what are essentially the same facts. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, a farmer, who finds a rusty cup on the land sells it to B, an art 
dealer, for EUR 10,000. The high price is based upon the assumption 
of both parties that the cup is made of silver (other silver objects had 
previously been found on the land). It subsequently turns out that the 
object in question is an ordinary iron cup worth only EUR 1,000. B 
refuses to accept the cup and to pay for it on the ground that it lacks 
the assumed quality. B also avoids the contract on the ground of 
mistake as to the quality of the cup. B is entitled only to the remedies 
for non-performance. 
It may be that the conflict between the two sets of remedies is only 
potential, since the mistaken party could have relied upon a remedy for 
non-performance, but is actually precluded from doing so by special 
circumstances, for example because a statutory limitation period has 
lapsed. Even in such a case this Article applies with the consequence 
that the remedy of avoidance for mistake is excluded. 
ARTICLE  3.2.5 
(Fraud) 
A party may avoid the contract when it has 
been led to conclude the contract by the other 
party’s 
fraudulent 
representation, 
including 
language or practices, or fraudulent non-
disclosure of circumstances which, according to 
reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, 
the latter party should have disclosed. 
COMMENT 
1. Fraud and mistake 
Avoidance of a contract by a party on the ground of fraud bears some 
resemblance to avoidance for a certain type of mistake. Fraud may be 
regarded as a special case of mistake caused by the other 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.6 
 
107 
party. Fraud, like mistake, may involve either representations, whether 
express or implied, of false facts or non-disclosure of true facts. 
2. Notion of fraud 
The decisive distinction between fraud and mistake lies in the nature 
and purpose of the defrauding party’s representations or non-disclosure. 
What entitles the defrauded party to avoid the contract is the 
“fraudulent” representation or non-disclosure of relevant facts. Such 
conduct is fraudulent if it is intended to lead the other party into error 
and thereby to gain an advantage to the detriment of the other party. The 
reprehensible nature of fraud is such that it is a sufficient ground for 
avoidance without the need for the presence of the additional conditions 
laid down in Article 3.2.2 for the mistake to become relevant. 
A mere “puff” in advertising or negotiations does not suffice. 
ARTICLE  3.2.6 
(Threat) 
A party may avoid the contract when it has 
been led to conclude the contract by the other 
party’s unjustified threat which, having regard to 
the circumstances, is so imminent and serious as 
to leave the first party no reasonable alternative. 
In particular, a threat is unjustified if the act or 
omission with which a party has been threatened 
is wrongful in itself, or it is wrongful to use it as a 
means to obtain the conclusion of the contract. 
COMMENT 
This Article permits the avoidance of a contract on the ground of 
threat.  
1. Threat must be imminent and serious 
Threat of itself is not sufficient. It must be of so imminent and 
serious a character that the threatened person has no reasonable 
alternative but to conclude the contract on the terms proposed by the 
Art. 3.2.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
108 
other party. The imminence and seriousness of the threat must be 
evaluated by an objective standard, taking into account the 
circumstances of the individual case. 
2. Unjustified threat 
The threat must in addition be unjustified. The second sentence of 
this Article sets out, by way of illustration, two examples of an 
unjustified threat. The first envisages a case where the act or omission 
with which the contracting party has been threatened is wrongful in 
itself (e.g. a physical attack). The second refers to a situation where the 
threatened act or omission is in itself lawful, but the purpose to be 
achieved is wrongful (e.g. the bringing of a court action for the sole 
purpose of inducing the other party to conclude the contract on the terms 
proposed). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, who is in default with the repayment of a loan, is threatened 
by B, the lender, with proceedings for the recovery of the money. 
The only purpose of this threat is to obtain on particularly 
advantageous terms a lease of A’s warehouse. A signs the lease, but 
is entitled to avoid the contract. 
3. Threat affecting reputation or economic interests 
For the purpose of the application of this Article, threat need not 
necessarily be made against a person or property, but may also affect 
reputation or purely economic interests.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
Faced with a threat by the players of a basketball team to go on 
strike unless they receive a much higher bonus than had already been 
agreed for winning the four remaining matches of the season, the 
owner of the team agrees to pay the requested bonus. The owner is 
entitled to avoid the new contract with the players, since the strike 
would have led automatically to the team being relegated to a minor 
league and therefore represented a serious and imminent threat to 
both the reputation and the financial position of the club.  
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.7 
 
109 
ARTICLE  3.2.7 
(Gross disparity) 
(1) A party may avoid the contract or an 
individual term of it if, at the time of the con-
clusion of the contract, the contract or term 
unjustifiably gave the other party an excessive 
advantage. Regard is to be had, among other 
factors, to 
(a) the fact that the other party has taken 
unfair advantage of the first party’s dependence, 
economic distress or urgent needs, or of its 
improvidence, ignorance, inexperience or lack of 
bargaining skill, and 
(b) the nature and purpose of the contract. 
(2) Upon the request of the party entitled 
to avoidance, a court may adapt the contract or 
term in order to make it accord with reasonable 
commercial standards of fair dealing. 
(3) A court may also adapt the contract or 
term upon the request of the party receiving 
notice of avoidance, provided that that party 
informs the other party of its request promptly 
after receiving such notice and before the other 
party has reasonably acted in reliance on it. 
Article 3.2.10(2) applies accordingly. 
COMMENT 
1. Excessive advantage 
This provision permits a party to avoid a contract in cases where 
there is gross disparity between the obligations of the parties, which 
gives one party an unjustifiably excessive advantage.  
The excessive advantage must exist at the time of the conclusion of 
the contract. A contract which, although not grossly unfair when entered 
into, becomes so later may be adapted or terminated under the rules on 
hardship contained in Chapter 6, Section 2. 
As the term “excessive” advantage denotes, even a considerable 
disparity in the value and the price or some other element which upsets 
the equilibrium of performance and counter-performance is not 
Art. 3.2.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
110 
sufficient to permit the avoidance or the adaptation of the contract under 
this Article. What is required is that the disequilibrium is in the 
circumstances so great as to shock the conscience of a reasonable 
person. 
2. Unjustifiable advantage 
Not only must the advantage be excessive, it must also be unjus-
tifiable. Whether this requirement is met will depend upon an evaluation 
of all the relevant circumstances of the case. Paragraph (1) of this 
Article refers in particular to two factors which deserve special attention 
in this connection. 
a. Unequal bargaining position 
The first factor is that one party has taken unfair advantage of the 
other party’s dependence, economic distress or urgent needs, or its 
improvidence, ignorance, inexperience, or lack of bargaining skill (sub-
paragraph (a)). As to the dependence of one party vis-à-vis the other, 
superior bargaining power due to market conditions alone is not 
sufficient. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, the owner of an automobile factory, sells an outdated assembly 
line to B, a Governmental agency from a country eager to set up its 
own automobile industry. Although A makes no representations as to 
the efficiency of the assembly line, it succeeds in fixing a price 
which is manifestly excessive. B, after discovering that it has paid an 
amount which corresponds to that of a much more modern assembly 
line, is entitled to avoid the contract. 
b. Nature and purpose of the contract 
The second factor to which special regard must be had is the nature 
and purpose of the contract (sub-paragraph (b)). There are situations 
where an excessive advantage is unjustifiable even if the party who will 
benefit from it has not abused the other party’s weak bargaining 
position. 
Whether this is the case will often depend upon the nature and purpose 
of the contract. Thus, a contract term providing for an extremely short 
period for giving notice of defects in goods or services to be supplied may 
or may not be excessively advantageous to the seller or supplier, 
depending on the character of the goods or services in question. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.8 
 
111 
Equally, an agent’s fee expressed in terms of a fixed percentage of the 
price of the goods or services to be sold or rendered, although justified in 
the event of the agent’s contribution to the conclusion of the transaction 
being substantial and/or the value of the goods or services concerned not 
being very high, may well turn out to confer an excessive advantage on 
the agent if the latter’s contribution is almost negligible and/or the value 
of the goods or services are extraordinarily high. 
c. Other factors 
Other factors may need to be taken into consideration, for example 
the ethics prevailing in the business or trade. 
3. Avoidance or adaptation 
The avoidance of the contract or of any of its individual terms under 
this Article is subject to the general rules laid down in Articles 3.2.11 to 
3.2.16. 
However, according to paragraph (2) of this Article, at the request of 
the party who is entitled to avoidance, the court may adapt the contract 
in order to bring it into accord with reasonable commercial standards of 
fair dealing. Similarly, according to paragraph (3) the party receiving 
notice of avoidance may also request such adaptation provided it 
informs the avoiding party of its request promptly after receiving the 
notice of avoidance, and before the avoiding party has reasonably acted 
in reliance on that notice. 
After such a request by the other party, the party entitled to 
avoidance looses its right to avoid the contract and any earlier notice of 
avoidance becomes ineffective (see Article 3.2.10(2). 
If the parties are in disagreement as to the procedure to be adopted, it 
will be for the court to decide whether the contract is to be avoided or 
adapted and, if adapted, on which terms. 
ARTICLE  3.2.8 
(Third persons) 
(1) Where fraud, threat, gross disparity or 
a party’s mistake is imputable to, or is known or 
ought to be known by, a third person for whose 
acts the other party is responsible, the contract 
may be avoided under the same conditions as if 
the behaviour or knowledge had been that of the 
party itself. 
Art. 3.2.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
112 
(2) Where fraud, threat or gross disparity 
is imputable to a third person for whose acts the 
other party is not responsible, the contract may 
be avoided if that party knew or ought to have 
known of the fraud, threat or disparity, or has not 
at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in 
reliance on the contract. 
COMMENT 
This Article deals with situations, frequent in practice, in which a 
third person has been involved or has interfered in the negotiation 
process, and the ground for avoidance is in one way or another 
imputable to that person. 
1. Third person for whom a party is responsible 
Paragraph (1) is concerned with cases in which fraud, threat, gross 
disparity or a party’s mistake is caused by a third person for whose acts 
the other party is responsible, or cases in which, without causing the 
mistake, the third person knew or ought to have known of it. A party is 
responsible for the acts of a third person in a variety of situations 
ranging from those in which that person is an agent of the party in 
question to those where the third person acts for the benefit of that party 
on its own initiative. In all such cases it seems justified to impute to that 
party the third person’s acts or its knowledge, whether actual or 
constructive, of certain circumstances, and this irrespective of whether 
the party in question knew of the third person’s acts. 
2. Third person for whom a party is not responsible 
Paragraph (2) deals with cases where a party is defrauded, threatened 
or otherwise unduly influenced by a third person for whom the other 
party is not responsible. Such acts may be imputed to the latter party 
only if it knew or ought to have known of them.  
There is however one exception to this rule: the defrauded, 
threatened or otherwise unduly influenced party is entitled to avoid the 
contract, even if the other party did not know of the third person’s acts, 
whenever the other party has not reasonably acted in reliance on the 
contract before the time of avoidance. This exception is justified 
because in this situation the other party is not in need of protection. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.10 
 
113 
ARTICLE  3.2.9 
(Confirmation) 
If the party entitled to avoid the contract 
expressly or impliedly confirms the contract after 
the period of time for giving notice of avoidance 
has begun to run, avoidance of the contract is 
excluded. 
COMMENT 
This Article lays down the rule according to which the party entitled 
to avoid the contract may either expressly or impliedly confirm the 
contract. 
For there to be an implied confirmation it is not sufficient, for 
example, for the party entitled to avoid the contract to bring a claim 
against the other party based on the latter’s non-performance. A 
confirmation can only be assumed if the other party acknowledges the 
claim or if a court action has been successful. 
There is also confirmation if the party entitled to avoidance continues 
to perform the contract without reserving its right to avoid the contract. 
ARTICLE  3.2.10 
(Loss of  right to avoid) 
(1) If a party is entitled to avoid the 
contract for mistake but the other party declares 
itself willing to perform or performs the contract 
as it was understood by the party entitled to 
avoidance, the contract is considered to have been 
concluded as the latter party understood it. The 
other party must make such a declaration or 
render such performance promptly after having 
been informed of the manner in which the party 
entitled to avoidance had understood the contract 
and before that party has reasonably acted in 
reliance on a notice of avoidance. 
(2) After such a declaration or perform-
ance the right to avoidance is lost and any earlier 
notice of avoidance is ineffective. 
Art. 3.2.10 
UNIDROIT Principles 
114 
COMMENT 
1. Performance of the contract as understood by the mistaken 
party 
According to this Article a mistaken party may be prevented from 
avoiding the contract if the other party declares itself willing to perform 
or actually performs the contract as it was understood by the mistaken 
party. The interest of the other party in so doing may lie in the benefit to 
be derived from the contract, even in its adapted form. 
Such regard for the interests of the other party is only justified in the 
case of mistake and not in other cases of defective consent (threat and 
fraud) where it would be extremely difficult to expect the parties to keep 
the contract alive. 
2. Decision to be made promptly 
The other party has to declare its decision to perform or actually to 
perform the contract in its adapted form promptly after having been 
informed of the manner in which the mistaken party had understood the 
contract. How the other party is to receive the information about the 
erroneous understanding of the terms of the contract will depend on the 
circumstances of the case. 
3. Loss of right to avoid 
Paragraph (2) expressly states that after the other party’s declaration 
or performance the right of the mistaken party to avoid the contract is 
lost and that any earlier notice of avoidance becomes ineffective. 
Conversely, the other party is no longer entitled to adapt the contract 
if the mistaken party has not only given notice of avoidance but has also 
reasonably acted in reliance on that notice. 
4. Damages 
The adaptation of the contract by the other party does not preclude 
the mistaken party from claiming damages in accordance with Article 
3.2.16 if it has suffered loss which is not compensated by the adaptation 
of the contract. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance

115 
ARTICLE  3.2.11 
(Notice of avoidance) 
The right of a party to avoid the contract is 
exercised by notice to the other party. 
COMMENT 
1. The requirement of notice 
This Article states the principle that the right of a party to avoid the 
contract is exercised by notice to the other party without the need for 
any intervention by a court. 
2. Form and content of notice 
No provision is made in this Article for any specific requirement as 
to the form or content of the notice of avoidance. It follows that, in 
accordance with the general rule laid down in Article 1.10(1), the notice 
may be given by any means appropriate to the circumstances. As to the 
content of the notice, it is not necessary that the term “avoidance” 
actually be used, or that the reasons for avoiding the contract be stated 
expressly. However, for the sake of clarity a party would be well 
advised to give some reasons for the avoidance in its notice, although in 
cases of fraud or gross disparity the avoiding party may assume that 
those reasons are already known to the other party. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, B’s employer, threatens B with dismissal if B does not sell A a 
Louis XVI chest of drawers. B ultimately agrees to the sale. Two 
days later A receives a letter from B announcing B’s resignation and 
stating that B has sold the chest of drawers to C. B’s letter is 
sufficient notice of avoidance of the contract of sale with A. 
3. Notice must be received 
The notice of avoidance becomes effective when it reaches the other 
party (see Article 1.10(2)). 
Art. 3.2.13 
UNIDROIT Principles 
116 
ARTICLE  3.2.12 
(Time limits) 
(1) Notice of avoidance shall be given 
within a reasonable time, having regard to the 
circumstances, after the avoiding party knew or 
could not have been unaware of the relevant facts 
or became capable of acting freely. 
(2) Where an individual term of the 
contract may be avoided by a party under Article 
3.2.7, the period of time for giving notice of 
avoidance begins to run when that term is 
asserted by the other party. 
COMMENT 
According to paragraph (1) of this Article notice of avoidance must 
be given within a reasonable time after the avoiding party became aware 
or could not have been unaware of the relevant facts or became capable 
of acting freely. More precisely, the mistaken or defrauded party must 
give notice of avoidance within a reasonable time after it became aware 
or could no longer be unaware of the mistake or fraud. The same applies 
in cases of gross disparity which result from an abuse of the innocent 
party’s ignorance, improvidence or inexperience. In cases of threat or 
abuse of the innocent party’s dependence, economic distress or urgent 
needs the period runs from the time the threatened or abused party 
becomes capable of acting freely. 
In case of avoidance of an individual term of the contract in 
accordance with Article 3.2.7, paragraph (2) of this Article states that 
the period of time for giving notice begins to run when that term is 
asserted by the party.  
ARTICLE  3.2.13 
(Partial avoidance) 
Where a ground of avoidance affects only 
individual terms of the contract, the effect of 
avoidance is limited to those terms unless, having 
regard to the circumstances, it is unreasonable to 
uphold the remaining contract. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.14 
 
117 
COMMENT 
This Article deals with situations where the grounds of avoidance 
affect only individual terms of the contract. In such cases the effects of 
avoidance will be limited to the terms affected unless it would in the 
circumstances be unreasonable to uphold the remaining contract. This 
will generally depend upon whether or not a party would have entered 
into the contract had it envisaged that the terms in question would have 
been affected by grounds of avoidance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, a contractor, agrees to build two houses on plots of land X 
and Y for B, one of which B intends to live in and the other to let. B 
was mistaken in assuming that it had a licence to build on both plots, 
since in fact the licence covered only plot X. Unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise, notwithstanding the avoidance of 
the contract concerning the building of the house on plot Y, it would 
be reasonable to uphold the remaining contract concerning the 
building of the house on plot X. 
2. 
The situation is the same as in Illustration 1, except that a 
school was to be built on plot X and living quarters for the students 
on plot Y. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, after the 
avoidance of the contract concerning the building of the living 
quarters on plot Y it would not be reasonable to uphold the 
remaining contract for the building of the school on plot X. 
ARTICLE  3.2.14 
(Retroactive effect of avoidance) 
Avoidance takes effect retroactively. 
COMMENT 
This Article states the rule that avoidance takes effect retroactively. 
In other words, the contract is considered never to have existed. In the 
case of a partial avoidance under Article 3.2.13 the rule applies only to 
the avoided part of the contract. 
There are however individual terms of the contract which may 
survive even in cases of total avoidance. Arbitration, jurisdiction and 
choice-of-law clauses are considered to be different from the other terms 
of the contract and may be upheld notwithstanding the avoidance of the 
contract in whole or in part. Whether in fact such clauses remain 
operative is to be determined by the applicable domestic law. 
Art. 3.2.15 
UNIDROIT Principles 
118 
ARTICLE  3.2.15 
(Restitution) 
(1)  On avoidance either party may claim 
restitution of whatever it has supplied under the 
contract, or the part of it avoided, provided that 
such party concurrently makes restitution of 
whatever it has received under the contract, or 
the part of it avoided. 
(2)  If restitution in kind is not possible or 
appropriate, an allowance has to be made in 
money whenever reasonable. 
(3)  The recipient of the performance does 
not have to make an allowance in money if the 
impossibility to make restitution in kind is 
attributable to the other party. 
(4)  Compensation may be claimed for 
expenses reasonably required to preserve or 
maintain the performance received. 
COMMENT 
1. Right of parties to restitution on avoidance  
According to paragraph (1) of this Article either party may claim 
restitution of what the party has supplied under the contract or the part 
of it avoided. The only condition is that each party makes restitution of 
whatever the party has received under the contract or the part of it 
avoided. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
1.  
In the process of a takeover of a company, the controlling 
shareholder A agrees to sell and transfer to B shares for GBP 
100,000. After discovering that A had fraudulently misstated the 
profits the company was earning, B avoids the contract. B can claim 
back the purchase price of GBP 100,000. At the same time, B has to 
return the shares received from A. 
As regards the costs involved in making restitution, Article 6.1.11 
applies. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.15 
 
119 
2. Restitution in kind not possible or appropriate 
Restitution must normally be in kind. There are, however, instances 
where instead of restitution in kind, an allowance in money has to be 
made. This is the case, first of all, where restitution in kind is not 
possible. The allowance will normally amount to the value of the 
performance received. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
2.  
A commissions B to paint A’s factory. B had fraudulently 
induced A to conclude the contract at a price that is much higher than 
the market price. After having discovered the fraud, A avoids the 
contract. A can reclaim the purchase price from B while A is itself 
under a duty to pay for the value of having had its factory painted. 
An allowance is further envisaged by paragraph (2) of this Article 
whenever restitution in kind would not be appropriate. This is so in 
particular when returning the performance in kind would cause 
unreasonable effort or expense. The standard, in that respect, is the same 
as under Article 7.2.2(b). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
3.  
Antiquarian A fraudulently induces antiquarian B to buy a 
collection of gold coins. The gold coins are reloaded onto one of B’s 
ships. In a heavy storm the ship sinks. B subsequently discovers the 
fraud and avoids the contract. B can recover the price that it has paid, 
while itself having to make an allowance representing the value of the 
gold coins. This is in view of the fact that recovery of the gold coins 
from the sunken ship would involve expenses vastly exceeding their 
value. 
The purpose of specifying that an allowance has to be made in 
money “whenever reasonable” is to make it clear that an allowance only 
has to be made if, and to the extent that, the performance received 
constitutes a benefit for the recipient. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
4.  
A has undertaken to decorate the entrance hall of B’s business 
centre. After A has completed about half of the decorations B 
discovers that A is not the well-known decorator A has pretended to 
be. B avoids the contract. Since the decorations so far made cannot 
be returned and if they have no value for B, A is not entitled to any 
allowance for the work done. 
Art. 3.2.15 
UNIDROIT Principles 
120 
3. The allocation of risk 
The rule contained in paragraph (2) implies an allocation of risk: it 
imposes a liability on the recipient of the performance to make good the 
value of that performance if it is unable to make restitution in kind. The 
rule in paragraph (2) applies irrespective of whether the recipient was 
responsible for the deterioration or destruction of what it had received. 
This allocation of the risk of deterioration or destruction is justified, in 
particular, because the risk should lie with the person in control of the 
performance. On the contrary, there is no liability to make good the 
value if the deterioration or destruction is attributable to the other party, 
either because it was due to the other party’s fault, or because it was due 
to a defect inherent in the performance. Hence the rule in paragraph (3). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
5.  
Art dealer A buys from art dealer B a painting which both of 
them believe to be a genuine Constable. Subsequently doubts arise 
about the authenticity of the painting. B undertakes to obtain an 
expert opinion by the well-known expert C. C confirms that the 
painting actually is from a much less well-known painter living at 
the time of Constable. Due to B’s negligence, the painting is 
destroyed on the way back from C to A. A avoids the contract on the 
ground of a relevant mistake under Article 3.2.2. A can claim back 
the purchase price but does not have to make an allowance for the 
value of the painting. 
The recipient’s liability to pay the value of the performance received 
is not excluded in cases where the deterioration or destruction would 
also have occurred had the performance not been rendered. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
6.  
Company A sells and transfers earth-moving equipment to 
company B. The equipment is subsequently destroyed by a hurricane 
that floods the properties of both A and B. B avoids the contract 
because of a relevant mistake under Article 3.2.2. B can reclaim the 
purchase price but, at the same time, B has to make an allowance for 
the value of the earth-moving equipment. 
Nor is the recipient’s liability to make good the value of the 
performance excluded in cases where it has been led to conclude the 
contract by the other party’s fraudulent representation.

7.  
Antique dealer A has fraudulently induced garage owner B to 
swap A’s ramshackle car against a valuable ancient Greek vase 
belonging to B. The car is accidentally destroyed while standing in 
B’s garage. If B avoids the contract under Article 3.2.5, B can claim 
the vase back but has to make good the value of the car. 
While Article 3.2.5 is intended to make sure that B is not bound by 
the contract that it has entered into (hence the right of avoidance) and  
that B is not saddled with the consequences of a bad bargain that A has 
induced B to make (hence the right to restitution), Article 3.2.5. does not 
protect B against accidents. 
The question of the recipient’s liability to pay the value of the 
performance only arises in cases where the deterioration or destruction 
occurs before avoidance of the contract. If what has been performed 
deteriorates or is destroyed after avoidance of the contract, the recipient 
of the performance is under a duty to return what the recipient has 
received. Any non-performance of that duty gives the other party a right 
to claim damages according to Article 7.4.1, unless the non-performance 
is excused under Article 7.1.7. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
8.  
Art dealer A buys from art dealer B a painting which both 
parties believe to be a genuine Constable. After it has become 
apparent that the painting actually is from a much less well-known 
painter living at the time of Constable, A avoids the contract on the 
ground of a relevant mistake under Article 3.2.2. As a result, A can 
reclaim the purchase price but is under a duty to return the painting. 
Before A can return the painting it is stolen by burglars. Whether B 
can claim damages depends on whether the burglary can be regarded 
as force majeure (see Article 7.1.7). 
4. Compensation for expenses 
If the recipient of a performance has incurred expenses for the 
preservation or maintenance of the object of the performance, it is 
reasonable to allow the recipient to claim compensation for these 
expenses in cases where the contract has been avoided and where, 
therefore, the parties have to return what they have received. 
Art. 3.2.16

9.  
Company A has sold and delivered a race horse to company B. 
After some time B realises that A has fraudulently concealed from 
him the true parentage of that horse. B avoids the contract. B can 
claim compensation for the costs incurred in feeding and caring for 
the horse. 
This rule applies only to reasonable expenses. What is reasonable 
depends on the circumstances of the case. In Illustration 9 it would 
matter whether the horse had been sold as a race horse or as an ordinary 
farm horse.  
Compensation cannot be claimed for expenses which are not 
required to preserve or maintain the performance received, even if they 
are reasonable. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
10.  Company A has sold and delivered a software package to 
company B which both parties believe to possess a certain 
functionality. When B discovers that this is not the case, B asks C to 
check whether that functionality can still be implemented. Since that 
turns out not to be possible, B avoids the contract for relevant 
mistake under Article 3.2.2. B cannot recover from A the fee paid to 
C as expenses under paragraph (4). 
5. Benefits 
The Principles do not take a position concerning benefits that have 
been derived from the performance, or interest that has been earned. In 
commercial practice it will often be difficult to establish the value of the 
benefits received by the parties as a result of the performance. 
Furthermore, often both parties will have received such benefits. 
ARTICLE  3.2.16 
(Damages) 
Irrespective of whether or not the contract 
has been avoided, the party who knew or ought to 
have known of the ground for avoidance is liable 
for damages so as to put the other party in the 
same position in which it would have been if it 
had not concluded the contract. 
 
Grounds for Avoidance 
Art. 3.2.17 
 
123 
COMMENT 
1. Damages if ground for avoidance known to the other party 
This Article provides that a party which knew or ought to have 
known of a ground for avoidance is liable for damages to the other 
party. The right to damages arises irrespective of whether or not the 
contract has been avoided. 
2. The measure of damages 
Unlike the damages in case of non-performance under Chapter 7, 
Section 4, the damages contemplated by this Article are intended simply 
to put the other party in the position it would have been in if it had not 
concluded the contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
Company A sells software to company B and could not have been 
unaware of B’s mistake as to its appropriateness for the use intended 
by B. Irrespective of whether or not B avoids the contract, A is liable 
to B for all the expenses incurred by B in training its personnel in the 
use of the software, but not for the loss suffered by B as a 
consequence of the impossibility to use the software for the intended 
purpose.  
ARTICLE  3.2.17 
(Unilateral declarations) 
The provisions of this Chapter apply with 
appropriate adaptations to any communication of 
intention addressed by one party to the other. 
COMMENT 
This Article takes account of the fact that, apart from the contract 
itself, the parties, either before or after the conclusion of the contract, 
often exchange a number of communications of intention which may 
likewise be affected by invalidity  
In a commercial setting, the most important example of unilateral 
communications of intention that are external, but preparatory, to a 
contract are bids for investment, works, delivery of goods or provision 
Art. 3.2.17 
UNIDROIT Principles 
124 
of services. Communications of intention made after the conclusion of a 
contract take a variety of forms, such as notices, declarations, demands 
and requests. In particular, waivers and declarations by which a party 
assumes an obligation may be affected by a defect of consent.

SECTION  3: ILLEGALITY 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  3.3.1 
(Contracts infringing mandatory rules) 
(1)  Where a contract infringes a man-
datory rule, whether of national, international or 
supranational origin, applicable under Article 1.4 
of these Principles, the effects of that infrin-
gement upon the contract are the effects, if any, 
expressly prescribed by that mandatory rule. 
(2)  Where the mandatory rule does not 
expressly prescribe the effects of an infringement 
upon a contract, the parties have the right to 
exercise such remedies under the contract as in 
the circumstances are reasonable.  
(3)  In determining what is reasonable 
regard is to be had in particular to:  
(a) the purpose of the rule which has been 
infringed;  
(b) the category of persons for whose 
protection the rule exists;  
(c) any sanction that may be imposed 
under the rule infringed;  
(d) the seriousness of the infringement;  
(e) whether one or both parties knew or 
ought to have known of the infringement;  
(f) whether 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
contract necessitates the infringement; and 
(g) the parties’ reasonable expectations.  
COMMENT  
1. Scope of the Section 
Despite its paramount importance (see Article 1.1), under the 
Principles freedom of contract is not without limit. Not only must 
parties conclude the contract without error and without constraints, also 
the contract must not violate the applicable mandatory rules. While 
defects of consent are dealt with in Section 2 of this Chapter, this 
Section is concerned with a contract that infringes mandatory rules, 
Art. 3.3.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
 
126 
 
whether by its terms, performance, purpose or otherwise. More 
precisely, this Section deals with the effects of that infringement on the 
contract by laying down the criteria to be followed in determining 
whether, despite the infringement, parties may still be granted remedies, 
and if so, whether there will be remedies under the contract (Article 
3.3.1) or restitution (Article 3.3.2).  
2.  Only mandatory rules applicable under Article 1.4 relevant 
For the purpose of this Section, only mandatory rules, whether of 
national, international or supranational origin, that are applicable under 
Article 1.4 are relevant (see Comments 1 and 2 on Article 1.4). In other 
words, this Section is concerned only with a contract infringing 
mandatory rules, be they specific statutory provisions or unwritten 
general principles of public policy, which are applicable in accordance 
with the relevant rules of private international law. Which mandatory 
rules will be applicable in a given case basically depends on whether the 
dispute is pending before a domestic court or an arbitral tribunal, and on 
whether the parties’ reference to the Principles is considered to be only 
an agreement to incorporate them in the contract or whether the 
Principles are applied as the law governing the contract (see Comments 
3, 4 and 5 on Article 1.4). Note that the Illustrations below do not 
address these questions and are based on the assumption that the 
mandatory rules referred to apply in the cases illustrated.   
3.  Ways in which a contract may infringe mandatory rules  
A contract may infringe mandatory rules first of all by its very terms. 
As shown by the following Illustrations concerning corruption and 
collusive bidding, mandatory rules may be specific statutory provisions 
or unwritten general principles of public policy.

ranking procurement advisor of D, the Minister of Economics and 
Development of country Y, in order to induce D to award A the 
contract for the construction of a new power plant in country Y 
(“the Contract”). In both countries X and Y bribery of public 
officials is prohibited by statute. The Commission Agreement 
infringes the statutory prohibitions in question by its terms. As to 
the Contract for the construction of the power plant, see Illustration

ranking officer of company D of country Y, in order to induce D to 
award A the contract for the installation of a sophisticated IT system. 
Neither in country X nor in country Y is bribery in the private sector 
prohibited by statute but in both countries it is considered contrary to 
public policy. The Commission Agreement violates these principles 
of public policy by its terms.  
3.  
Bidders A and B of countries X and Y respectively enter into 
an agreement (“the Collusive Bidding Agreement”) according to 
which in a series of public tendering proceedings for the 
procurement of construction contracts in country Z, they would 
collude so that A would get some of the contracts and B the others. 
A statutory regulation of country Z prohibits collusive bidding in 
public tendering proceedings. The Collusive Bidding Agreement 
infringes the statutory prohibition by its terms. 
4.  
Bidders A and B of countries X and Y respectively enter into 
an agreement (“the Collusive Bidding Agreement”) according to 
which in a series of public tendering proceedings for the 
procurement of construction contracts in country Z, they would 
collude so that A would get some of the contracts and B the others. 
In country Z there is no statutory regulation prohibiting collusive 
bidding in public tendering proceedings but collusive bidding is 
considered contrary to public policy. The Collusive Bidding 
Agreement violates this principle of public policy by its terms.  
A contract may also by its performance infringe mandatory rules. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
5.  
A, a large-scale retailer in country X, enters into an agreement 
with B, a manufacturer in country Y, for the manufacture of toys 
according to its specifications (“the Manufacture Agreement”). A 
knew or ought to have known that the toys ordered would be 
manufactured by child labourers. In both country X and country Y 
child labour is considered contrary to public policy. The 
Manufacture Agreement violates these principles of public policy by 
its performance. 
6.  
Importer A from country X enters into an agreement with 
exporter B from country Y for the supply of equipment. After the 
conclusion of the contract, the United Nations imposes an embargo 
on the importation of such type of equipment into country X. B 
nevertheless delivers the equipment in violation of the embargo. The 
agreement between A and B violates the embargo by its 
performance. 
Art. 3.3.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
 
128 
 
Moreover, a contract may also infringe mandatory rules in other 
ways, for example by the way in which it is formed or by its purpose. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
7.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B pays C 
the USD 10,000,000 bribe and D awards the Contract to A. The 
Contract violates the statutes prohibiting corruption by the way in 
which it is formed.  
8.  
A, a manufacturer of plastic explosives situated in country X, 
enters into an agreement with B, a trading company situated in 
country Y, for the supply of quantities of semtex, a material useful 
for peaceful purposes as well as for the manufacture of bombs (“the 
Supply Agreement”). A knew or ought to have known that B would 
ultimately forward the goods to a terrorist organisation. The Supply 
Agreement violates the fundamental principle of public policy 
prohibiting the support of terrorist activities by its purpose. 
4.  Effects of infringement expressly prescribed by the mandatory 
rule infringed 
Sometimes the mandatory rule itself expressly states which 
contractual or restitutionary remedies, if any, are available to the parties 
in case of its infringement. Thus, for instance, Article 101(2) of the 
Treaty on the European Union (former Article 85(2) of the Treaty of 
Rome) expressly states that anti-competitive agreements between 
enterprises which may affect trade between member States of the 
European Union prohibited under Article 101(1) “shall be automatically 
void”. Similarly the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally 
Exported Cultural Objects provides that “[a] Contracting State may 
request […] the return of a cultural object illegally exported from the 
territory of the requesting State” (Article 5) and that “[t]he possessor of 
a cultural object who acquired the object […] illegally exported shall be 
entitled […] to payment by the requesting State of fair and reasonable 
compensation, provided that [it] neither knew nor ought reasonably to 
have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally 
exported” (Article 6). 
5.  Effects of infringement to be determined according to what is 
reasonable in the circumstances 
If the mandatory rule does not expressly provide for the effects of its 
infringement upon the contract, paragraph (2) provides that the parties 
may exercise “such remedies under the contract as in the circumstances 
are reasonable”. The formula used is sufficiently broad to permit a 
 
Illegality 
Art. 3.3.1 
 
129 
 
maximum of flexibility. Thus, notwithstanding the infringement of the 
mandatory rule, one or both of the parties may, depending on the 
circumstances of the case, be granted the ordinary remedies available 
under a valid contract (including the right to performance), or other 
remedies such as the right to treat the contract as being of no effect, the 
adaptation of the contract or its termination on terms to be fixed. The 
latter kind of remedies may be particularly appropriate where as a 
consequence of the infringement only part of the contract becomes 
ineffective. As to the granting of restitution of the performances 
rendered under a contract infringing a mandatory rule, see Article 3.3.2.  
6.  Criteria for determining what is reasonable in the circumstances 
Given the great variety of mandatory rules which may be relevant 
under this Article, ranging from regulations of a merely technical nature 
to prohibitions for the purpose of preventing grave social harm, 
paragraph (3) provides a list of criteria to determine the contractual 
remedies available in the circumstances, if any. The list is not 
exhaustive. In many cases more than one of the criteria will be relevant 
and the decision will involve a weighing of these criteria.  
a. Purpose of the rule infringed 
Among the most important factors to be taken into consideration is 
the purpose of the mandatory rule and whether the attaining of its 
purpose would or would not be affected by granting at least one of the 
parties a remedy under the contract.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
9.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that even 
though B paid C A’s bribe, D does not award the Contract to A. 
Since the purpose of the relevant statutory prohibition of bribery 
would be frustrated by granting A and B any remedy under the 
Commission Agreement, B may not request the payment of the USD 
1,000,000 fee from A, nor may A recover from B the USD 
10,000,000 B has paid to C. 
10.  A, an aircraft manufacturer in country X, knowing that C, the 
Ministry of Defence of country Y, intends to purchase a number of 
military aircraft, enters into an agreement with B, a consultancy firm 
located in country Y, by which B is to negotiate the possible 
purchase by C of the aircraft manufactured by A (“the Agency 
Agreement”). A statutory regulation of country Y prohibits the 
employment of intermediaries in the negotiation and conclusion of 
contracts with governmental agencies. Since the purpose of the 
statutory prohibition of the employment of intermediaries is to fight 
Art. 3.3.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
 
130 
 
corruption, neither A nor B should be granted any remedy under the 
Agency Agreement.  
11.  The facts are the same as in Illustration 6. Since the purpose of 
the embargo is to impose a sanction on country X following  X’s 
violation of international law, the attaining of that purpose requires 
that all contracts concluded or performed in violation of the embargo 
have no effect and that parties be denied any remedy under such 
contracts.  
b. Category of persons to be protected by the rule infringed  
Another important factor to be taken into consideration is whether 
the mandatory rule that is infringed is aimed at protecting the interests 
of the public in general or those of a specific category of persons. 
Licensing requirements are often of the latter type, i.e. are imposed by 
law on those carrying out certain activities for the protection of their 
customers or clients. If a contract is entered into by an unlicensed party 
it might be reasonable to grant its customer or client at least some 
remedies under the contract such as damages. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
12.  Company A in country X enters into an agreement with 
engineer B in country Y for the preparation of plans for the 
restructuring of A’s factory (“the Engineering Contract”). A 
statutory regulation of country X requires that only licensed 
engineers carry out this activity. B, who does not have the necessary 
license, delivers plans that are in part based on erroneous 
calculations causing a delay in the restructuring work. Requested by 
A to pay damages for the loss caused by the delay, B refuses to pay 
on the ground that the Engineering Contract was invalid as B lacked 
the required license. Since the purpose of the license requirement is 
the protection of the clients, A may be granted the right to damages.  
c. Any sanction that may be imposed under the rule infringed 
Statutory regulations prohibiting certain activities or imposing 
limitations to certain activities often provide criminal or administrative 
sanctions. As noted in Comment 4, when such a regulation expressly 
states the effect of violation on contractual rights or remedies, that 
statement controls. When the regulation is silent as to that effect, 
however, the existence and nature of the criminal or administrative 
sanctions can provide important insight into the purpose of the rule that 
has been violated, the category of persons for whose protection the rule 
exists, and the seriousness of the violation. Accordingly, the existence 
and nature of these sanctions should be taken into consideration in 
 
Illegality 
Art. 3.3.1 
 
131 
 
determining the effect of such a violation on contractual rights and 
remedies.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
13.  A, an exporter in country X, enters into a contract of carriage 
with B, a ship-owner in country Y, to carry goods by sea from 
country X to country Y (“the Contract”). A statutory regulation in 
country X imposes limits on the loads that ships may carry. The 
statutory regulation provides for a fine in the case of its violation but 
it says nothing about the effects a violation would have on the 
individual contracts of carriage. B overloads the ship and A, 
claiming the invalidity of the Contract, refuses to pay the freight 
notwithstanding the fact that the goods had arrived safely. Since the 
purpose of the statutory regulation is to prevent, in the interests of 
the safety of the ship and its crew, overloading and not to prohibit 
contracts, and this purpose is sufficiently achieved by the fining of 
B, B may be granted the right to be paid the agreed freight for the 
carriage of the goods. 
d. Seriousness of infringement  
Another factor to be taken into consideration is the seriousness of the 
infringement. Thus, remedies under the contract may be granted where 
the mandatory rule is of a purely technical nature and its infringement 
has no impact on the other party.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
14.  Cattle farmer A in country X sells cattle to cattle farmer B in 
country Y. A statutory regulation in country Y requires incoming 
cattle to be properly tagged and that the information contained on the 
tags also be set out in accompanying documents. The cattle delivered 
is properly tagged but the accompanying documents are incomplete. 
A may nevertheless be granted the right to payment of the price. 
15.  A, an exporter in country X, enters into a contract with B, a 
carrier from country Y, for the carriage of dangerous goods from 
country X to country Y (“the Contract”). Country X has a statutory 
regulation requiring goods of the kind in question to be carried on a 
vehicle with particular safety requirements. The statutory regulation 
provides a criminal sanction in case of violation but says nothing 
about the effects a violation would have on the individual contracts 
of carriage. B carries the goods on a vehicle that does not meet the 
prescribed safety requirements. A, claiming the invalidity of the 
Contract, refuses to pay the freight notwithstanding the fact that the 
goods arrived safely. Since the purpose of the statutory regulations is 
the prevention of injury to third persons or damage to the 
Art. 3.3.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
 
132 
 
environment, B, irrespective of the imposition of the criminal 
sanction, should not be granted the right to be paid the agreed 
freight. 
e. Whether one or both parties knew or ought to have known of the 
infringement 
Granting remedies under the contract may also depend on whether 
one or even both of the parties knew or ought to have known of the 
mandatory rule or of its infringement.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
16.  The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B has 
paid the bribe to C and D, who neither knew nor ought to have 
known of the bribe to C, awarded the Contract to A. If D 
subsequently becomes aware of the payment of the bribe, D may 
choose whether or not to treat the Contract as effective. If D chooses 
to treat the Contract as effective, A will be obliged to perform and D 
will have to pay the price, subject to an appropriate adjustment 
taking into consideration the payment of the bribe. If, on the other 
hand, D chooses to treat the Contract as being of no effect, neither of 
the parties has a remedy under the Contract. This is without 
prejudice to any restitutionary remedy that may exist.  
17.  Contractor A of country X enters into negotiations with D, the 
Minister of Economics and Development of country Y, with a view 
to conclude an agreement on a large infrastructure project (“the 
Contract”). D requests the payment of a “commission” of 7.5% of 
the contract price in order to conclude the Contract. A pays the 
requested “commission” and the Contract is concluded. When A has 
already performed half of its obligations under the Contract, a new 
Government comes to power in country Y and the new Minister of 
Economics and Development, invoking the payment of the 
“commission”, cancels the project and refuses to pay for the work 
already performed. A is not entitled to any remedy under the 
Contract. This is without prejudice to any restitutionary remedy that 
may exist.  
f. Whether the performance of the contract necessitates the 
infringement 
Another factor to be taken into consideration is whether the 
performance of the contract necessitates the infringement. Thus, if by its 
very terms the contract provides for, or even only implicitly involves, 
the violation of a statutory regulation it might be reasonable not to grant 
the parties any remedy under the contract.

I l l u s t r a t i o n  
18.  Company A of country X enters into a contract with company 
B of country Y for the construction of a chemical fertiliser 
production plant in country Y (“the Contract”). The Contract does 
not provide for the installation of the safety devices required by the 
environmental protection laws of country Y and the parties 
deliberately agree on a price insufficient to cover the costs of the 
installation of the devices in question. Neither A nor B should be 
granted any remedy under the contract.  
g. The parties’ reasonable expectations 
If one of the parties on account of different legal or commercial 
culture could not have reasonably been aware of the infringement or, as 
is more often the case, one of the parties creates a legitimate expectation 
as to the enforceability of the contract or its individual terms and later 
invokes a statutory prohibition of its own law in order to nullify that 
expectation, it might be reasonable to grant the other party the remedies 
available under the contract or its individual terms. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
19.  Company A of country X enters into an agreement with B, the 
Minister of Economics and Development of country Y, concerning 
an investment project in country Y (“the Agreement”). The 
Agreement contains a clause providing that all disputes arising out of 
the Agreement should be decided by arbitration to be held in country 
Z in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. If a dispute 
subsequently arises and A commences arbitration proceedings, B, 
with a view to avoiding arbitration, cannot invoke a mandatory rule 
of country Y according to which the domestic courts of country Y 
have exclusive jurisdiction which may not be contractually excluded 
by an arbitration agreement for disputes relating to contracts of the 
type of the Agreement. 
h. Other criteria 
In addition to the criteria expressly listed in paragraph (3) of this 
Article, there are others which may be taken into consideration to 
determine the remedies available in the circumstances, if any. One 
criterion is the extent to which the contract infringes the mandatory rule. 
If the contract infringes the mandatory rule only in part, it may be 
reasonable to adapt the contract and grant the parties remedies under it. 
Art. 3.3.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
 
134 
 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
20.  The facts are the same as in Illustration 5, except that only one 
specific type of toy ordered by A is manufactured by child labourers 
in their homes, while all the other types are manufactured by workers 
lawfully employed by B in its factory. Under the circumstances it 
may be reasonable to adapt the Manufacture Agreement accordingly 
and grant the parties the ordinary remedies under the adapted 
Manufacture Agreement. 
Another factor is the timely withdrawal from the improper 
transaction. Thus, if a party to a contract infringing a mandatory rule 
repents of its action before the unlawful purpose of the contract has been 
achieved, that party may be granted the right to recover what it has 
performed. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
21.  The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that A, after 
having paid B the agreed fee of USD 1,000,000, but before B pays C 
the USD 10,000,000 bribe, decides no longer to pursue the illegal 
purpose and withdraws from the Contract. A may be granted the 
right to recover the fee from B. 
ARTICLE  3.3.2 
(Restitution) 
(1)  Where there has been performance 
under a contract infringing a mandatory rule 
under Article 3.3.1, restitution may be granted 
where this would be reasonable in the circum-
stances.  
(2)  In determining what is reasonable, 
regard is to be had, with the appropriate 
adaptations, to the criteria referred to in Article 
3.3.1(3). 
(3) If restitution is granted, the rules set 
out in Article 3.2.15 apply with appropriate 
adaptations.

COMMENT  
1.  Restitution under contracts infringing mandatory rules to be 
granted where reasonable under the circumstances 
Even where as a consequence of the infringement of a mandatory 
rule the parties are denied any remedies under the contract, it remains to 
be seen whether they may at least claim restitution of what they have 
rendered in performing the contract. According to Article 3.3.1(1), the 
answer first of all depends on the mandatory rule itself which may or 
may not expressly address the issue (see also Comment 4 on Article 
3.3.1). 
If the mandatory rule is silent on the issue, this Article, in line with 
the modern trend, adopts a flexible approach and provides that where 
there has been performance under a contract infringing a mandatory 
rule, restitution may be granted if this would be reasonable in the 
circumstances (paragraph 1). In other words, contrary to the traditional 
view that, at least where both parties were aware or ought to have been 
aware of the infringement of the mandatory rule, they should be left 
where they stand, i.e. should not even be entitled to recover the benefits 
conferred, under the Principles restitution may or may not be granted 
depending on whether it is more appropriate to allow the recipient to 
keep what it has received or to allow the performer to reclaim it.  
2. Criteria for determining whether granting of restitution 
reasonable  
The same criteria laid down in paragraph (3) of Article 3.3.1 to 
determine if any contractual remedies are available in the circumstances, 
if any, apply to determine whether granting restitution under paragraph 
(1) of this Article is reasonable. However, since the contractual and 
restitutionary remedies are different, the same criteria may lead to 
different results under the same facts.   
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1 in the Comments on 
Article 3.3.1, except that A, having been awarded the Contract, had 
almost completed the construction of the power plant when in 
country Y a new Government comes to power which claims that the 
Contract is invalid because of corruption and refuses to pay the 
outstanding 50% of the price. Under the circumstances it would not 
be fair to let D have the almost completed power plant for half the 
agreed price. A may be granted an allowance in money for the work 
done corresponding to the value that the almost completed power 
Art. 3.3.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
 
136 
 
plant has for D and D may be granted restitution of any payment it 
has made  exceeding this amount.  
2.  
Contractor A of country X enters into negotiations with D, the 
Minister of Economics and Development of country Y, with a view 
of concluding an agreement on a large infrastructure project (“the 
Contract”). D requests the payment of a “commission” of 7.5% of 
the contract price in order to conclude the Contract. A pays the 
requested “commission” and the Contract is concluded. After A has 
fulfilled all of its obligations under the Contract, a new Government 
comes to power in country Y and the new Minister of Economics 
and Development, invoking the payment of the “commission”, 
refuses to pay the remaining contract price. A may be granted an 
allowance in money for the work done corresponding to the value of 
the infrastructure project.  
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 15 in the Comments on 
Article 3.3.1, except that B, given that the goods had arrived safely at 
destination, claims the recovery of at least the value of its service. 
Under the circumstances, i.e. in view of the seriousness of the 
violation and the necessity of preventing by all means the carriage of 
dangerous goods by vehicles lacking the required safety 
requirements, B may not even be granted the right to recover the 
value of its service.   
3. Rules governing restitution if granted 
If restitution is granted under this Article it is governed by the rules 
set out in Article 3.2.15 on restitution in the context of avoidance. These 
rules however need some adaptations, in the sense that in paragraph (1) 
of Article 3.2.15 the reference to avoidance is to be understood as a 
reference to the case where the contract becomes ineffective as a result 
of the infringement of a mandatory rule, and the reference to avoidance 
of part of the contract as a reference to the case where only part of the 
contract becomes ineffective as a result of the infringement of a 
mandatory rule. For further explanation of the rules on restitution 
referred to in this Article, see the Comments on Article 3.2.15.

CHAPTER  4 
 
 
 
INTERPRETATION 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  4.1 
(Intention of the parties) 
(1) A 
contract 
shall 
be 
interpreted 
according to the common intention of the parties. 
(2) If 
such 
an 
intention 
cannot 
be 
established, the contract shall be interpreted 
according to the meaning that reasonable persons 
of the same kind as the parties would give to it in 
the same circumstances. 
COMMENT 
1. Common intention of the parties to prevail 
Paragraph (1) of this Article lays down the principle that in 
determining the meaning to be attached to the terms of a contract, 
preference is to be given to the intention common to the parties. In 
consequence, a contract term may be given a meaning which differs 
both from the literal sense of the language used and from the meaning 
which a reasonable person would attach to it, provided that such a 
different understanding was common to the parties at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract. 
The practical importance of the principle should not be over-
estimated, firstly because parties to commercial transactions are unlikely 
to use language in a sense entirely different from that usually attached to 
it, and secondly because even if this were to be the case it would be 
extremely difficult, once a dispute arises, to prove that a particular 
meaning which one of the parties claims to have been their common 
intention was in fact shared by the other party at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract. 
Art. 4.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
138 
2. Recourse to the understanding of reasonable persons 
For those cases where the common intention of the parties cannot be 
established, paragraph (2) provides that the contract shall be interpreted 
in accordance with the meaning which reasonable persons of the same 
kind as the parties would give to it in the same circumstances. The test 
is not a general and abstract criterion of reasonableness, but rather the 
understanding which could reasonably be expected of persons with, for 
example, the same linguistic knowledge, technical skill, or business 
experience as the parties. 
3. How to establish the common intention of the parties or to 
determine the understanding of reasonable persons 
In order to establish whether the parties had a common intention and, 
if so, what that common intention was, regard is to be had to all the 
relevant circumstances of the case, the most important of which are 
listed in Article 4.3. The same applies to the determination of the 
understanding of reasonable persons when no common intention of the 
parties can be established. 
4. Interpretation of standard terms 
Both the “subjective” test laid down in paragraph (1) and the 
“reasonableness” test in paragraph (2) may not always be appropriate in 
the context of standard terms. Indeed, given their special nature and 
purpose, standard terms should be interpreted primarily in accordance 
with the reasonable expectations of their average users irrespective of 
the actual understanding which either of the parties to the contract 
concerned, or reasonable persons of the same kind as the parties, might 
have had. For the definition of “standard terms”, see Article 2.1.19(2). 
ARTICLE  4.2 
(Interpretation of statements and other conduct) 
(1) The statements and other conduct of a 
party shall be interpreted according to that 
party’s intention if the other party knew or could 
not have been unaware of that intention. 
 
Interpretation 
Art. 4.2 
 
139 
(2) If the preceding paragraph is not 
applicable, such statements and other conduct 
shall be interpreted according to the meaning that 
a reasonable person of the same kind as the other 
party would give to it in the same circumstances. 
COMMENT 
1. Interpretation of unilateral acts 
By analogy to the criteria laid down in Article 4.1 with respect to the 
contract as a whole, this Article states that in the interpretation of 
unilateral statements or conduct preference is to be given to the 
intention of the party concerned, provided that the other party knew (or 
could not have been unaware) of that intention, and that in all other 
cases such statements or conduct are to be interpreted according to the 
understanding that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other 
party would have had in the same circumstances. 
In practice the principal field of application of this Article, which 
corresponds almost literally to Article 8(1) and (2) CISG, will be in the 
process of the formation of contracts where parties make statements and 
engage in conduct the precise legal significance of which may have to 
be established in order to determine whether or not a contract is 
ultimately concluded. There are however also unilateral acts performed 
after the conclusion of the contract which may give rise to problems of 
interpretation: for example, a notification of defects in goods, notice of 
avoidance or of termination of the contract, etc. 
2. How to establish the intention of the party performing the act or 
to determine the understanding of a reasonable person 
In applying both the “subjective” test laid down in paragraph (1) and 
the “reasonableness” test in paragraph (2), regard is to be had to all the 
relevant circumstances, the most important of which are listed in 
Article 4.3. 
Art. 4.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
140 
ARTICLE  4.3 
(Relevant circumstances) 
In applying Articles 4.1 and 4.2, regard 
shall be had to all the circumstances, including 
(a) preliminary negotiations between the 
parties; 
(b) practices 
which 
the 
parties 
have 
established between themselves; 
(c) the conduct of the parties subsequent 
to the conclusion of the contract; 
(d) the nature and purpose of the contract; 
(e) the meaning commonly given to terms 
and expressions in the trade concerned;  
(f) usages. 
COMMENT 
1. Circumstances relevant in the interpretation process 
This Article indicates circumstances which have to be taken into 
consideration when applying both the “subjective” test and the 
“reasonableness” test in Articles 4.1 and 4.2. The list mentions only 
those circumstances which are the most important and is in no way 
intended to be exhaustive. 
2. “Particular” and “general” circumstances compared 
Of the circumstances listed in this Article some relate to the 
particular relationship which exists between the parties concerned, while 
others are of a more general character. Although in principle all the 
circumstances listed may be relevant in a given case, the first three are 
likely to have greater weight in the application of the “subjective” test. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A contract for the writing of a book between A and B, a 
publisher, indicates that the book should consist of “about 300 
pages”. During their negotiations B had assured A that an 
approximate indication of the number of pages was necessary for 
administrative reasons and that A was not bound to stick precisely to 
that number of pages, but could exceed it, substantially if need 
 
Interpretation 
Art. 4.3

be. A submits a manuscript of 500 pages. In interpreting the meaning 
of “about 300 pages” due consideration should be given to these 
preliminary negotiations (see Article 4.3(a)). 
2. 
A, a Canadian manufacturer, and B, a United States retailer, 
conclude a number of contracts for the delivery of optical lenses in 
which the price is always expressed in Canadian dollars. A makes B 
a new offer indicating the price in “dollars” without further 
specification, but intending to refer again to Canadian dollars. In the 
absence of any indication to the contrary, A’s intention will prevail 
(see Article 4.3(b)). 
The remaining circumstances listed in this Article, i.e. the nature and 
purpose of the contract, the meaning commonly given to terms and 
expressions in the trade concerned and usages, are important primarily, 
although not exclusively, in the application of the “reasonableness” test. 
The criteria in sub-paragraphs (e) and (f) may at first sight appear to 
overlap. There is however a difference between them: while the 
“usages” apply only if they meet the requirements laid down in Article 
1.9, the “meaning commonly given [...] in the trade concerned” can be 
relevant even if it is peculiar to a trade sector to which only one, or even 
neither, party belongs, provided that the expression or term concerned is 
one which is typical in that trade sector.

3. 
A and B conclude a contract for the sale of a cargo of oil at 
USD 80 per barrel. The parties subsequently disagree on the size of 
the barrel to which they had referred, A having intended a barrel of 
42 standard gallons and B one of 36 Imperial gallons. In the absence 
of any indications to the contrary, A’s understanding prevails, since 
in the international oil trade it is a usage to measure barrels in 
standard gallons (see Article 4.3(f)). 
4. 
A, a shipowner, concludes a charterparty agreement with B for 
the carriage of grain containing the standard term “whether in berth 
or not” with respect to the commencement of the lay-time of the ship 
after its reaching the port of destination. When it subsequently 
emerges that the parties attached different meanings to the term, 
preference should, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, 
be given to the meaning commonly attached to it in the shipping 
trade since the term is typical in the shipping trade (see Article 
4.3(e)).

3. Practices established between parties and conduct subsequent to 
the conclusion of the contract relevant particularly in 
interpretation of long-term contracts 
Conduct subsequent to the conclusion of the contract can assist in 
determining what the parties intended their obligations to be. This may 
be the case particularly in the context of long-term contracts which 
involve complex performance and are “evolutionary” in nature, i.e. may 
require adaptations in the course of performance. Such contracts may 
involve repeated performance by one party with the opportunity for the 
other to assert that such performance does not conform to the contract. 
As a rule the subsequent conduct of the parties can only be an 
interpretative tool, i.e. be used to explain or amplify, but not to 
contradict, the terms of the contract as originally agreed between the 
parties.

5. 
Supplier A enters into a five-year contract with Shopping Mall 
B to supply B’s need for “salt” to clear ice in its parking lot and on 
its sidewalks. For the first two winters, A provides an ice-melting 
substance which is not a “salt,” with no objection being raised by B. 
At the start of the next winter, B objects that the substance is not a 
“salt” as stated in the contract. The fact that for two winters both A 
and B performed as though the supplied substance satisfied the 
contract permits the inference that the parties intended the contract’s 
reference to “salt” to include such an ice-melting substance. 
6. 
Contractor A agrees to provide Client B with concrete slabs of 
a particular thickness in a building at a unit price of X without 
specifying whether that price applies to a square metre of those slabs 
or cubic metres of concrete. The parties perform over several months 
without any objection as though the unit price applied to square 
metres of slabs. A dispute subsequently arises regarding the proper 
unit of measure. The fact that for several months A and B had 
performed as though the proper unit of measure was square metres of 
slabs permits the inference that the parties intended that to be the 
proper unit of measure. 
 
 
Interpretation 
Art. 4.3 
 
143 
To avoid any uncertainty as to the effects of subsequent conduct on 
the content of the contract, the parties may wish to adopt particular 
mechanisms for possible variations and adjustments of the contract in 
the course of performance. They may, for instance, provide for the 
issuance of “variation orders” by one party for acceptance by the other 
party (e.g. in construction contracts the “Employer’s Representative” 
and the “Contractor’s Representative”, respectively), or establish special 
bodies composed of representatives of both parties or of independent 
experts (so-called “contract management committees”, “auditing 
bodies” or the like), with the task of monitoring both parties’ 
performance and possibly also of suggesting adjustments to the contract 
so as to bring it in line with developments. Obviously, the more 
precisely the parties regulate the procedure for adjustments to the 
contract, the less relevant any informal conduct of the parties would be 
to the interpretation of the contract.    
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
7. 
A construction contract between Employer A and Contractor B 
provides that A’s “Representative” has the authority to give 
instructions regarding additions, omissions or other changes in work 
to be performed by B. So long as those additions, omissions or other 
changes fall within the overall scope of work under the contract, B 
will be bound to perform them and they will have the effect of 
changing the relevant work provided for in the original contract. 
 
8. 
Contractor A enters into a Design, Build and Operate (“DBO”) 
contract with Company B to design and build a factory and operate it 
for twenty years. The contract provides for the parties to appoint 
jointly an independent and impartial Auditing Body whose purpose 
is to audit and monitor the compliance of each of the parties with the 
operation management requirements set out in the contract. The 
contract may also provide that, if the Auditing Body determines that 
a party has failed to comply, that party must take appropriate 
corrective action. Therefore, if in a given case the Auditing Body 
determines that A has not complied with its obligations under the 
contract, A is bound to take the appropriate action.

4. “Merger” and “No oral modification” clauses 
Parties to international commercial transactions in general, and to 
complex long-term contracts in particular, frequently include a 
provision indicating that the contract document completely embodies 
the terms on which they have agreed (so-called “merger” or “entire 
agreement” clauses) and that any modification to the contract or specific 
terms of it must be made in writing  (so-called “no oral modification 
clauses”). For the effect of the former type of clauses, in particular 
whether and to what extent they exclude the relevance of preliminary 
negotiations between the parties, albeit only for the purpose of the 
interpretation of the contract, see Article 2.1.17. As to the latter type of 
clauses, see Article 2.1.18, and the limitation of the rule therein 
contained by virtue of the principle of prohibition of inconsistent 
behaviour laid down in Article 1.8.   
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
9. 
Manufacturer A enters into an agreement with Distributor B for 
the distribution of its products in country X. The agreement 
expressly states that the distributorship is non-exclusive and, in fact, 
in country X A’s products are distributed also by Distributor C. The 
agreement between A and B also contains a “no-oral modification” 
clause according to which any modification of its terms has to be in 
writing and approved by A’s parent company. Subsequently C ceases 
its activity and B acts, to A’s knowledge, as though it has become 
the exclusive distributor of A’s products in country X by, among 
others things, holding itself out as such to C’s clients, without any 
reaction on the part of A. When A replaces C with a new distributor, 
B may not object that by their conduct A and B have modified their 
original agreement, turning it into an exclusive agreement. 
ARTICLE  4.4 
(Reference to contract or statement as a whole) 
Terms and expressions shall be interpreted 
in the light of the whole contract or statement in 
which they appear. 
 
Interpretation 
Art. 4.5 
 
145 
COMMENT 
1. Interpretation in the light of the whole contract or statement 
Terms and expressions used by one or both parties are clearly not 
intended to operate in isolation but have to be seen as an integral part of 
their general context. Consequently they should be interpreted in the 
light of the whole contract or statement in which they appear. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, a licensee, hears that, despite a provision in their contract granting 
A an exclusive licence, B, the licensor, has concluded a similar 
contract with C, one of A’s competitors. A sends B a letter 
complaining of B’s breach and ending with the words “your 
behaviour has clearly demonstrated that it was a mistake on our part 
to rely on your professional correctness. We hereby avoid the 
contract we have with you”. Despite the use of the term “avoid”, A’s 
words interpreted in the light of the letter as a whole, must be 
understood as a notice of termination. 
2. In principle no hierarchy among contract terms 
In principle there is no hierarchy among contract terms, in the sense 
that their respective importance for the interpretation of the remaining 
part of the contract is the same regardless of the order in which they 
appear. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Firstly, declarations 
of intent made in the preamble may or may not be of relevance for the 
interpretation of the operative provisions of the contract. Secondly, it 
goes without saying that, in cases of conflict, provisions of a specific 
character prevail over provisions laying down more general rules. 
Finally, the parties may themselves expressly establish a hierarchy 
among the different provisions or parts of their contract. This is 
frequently the case with complex agreements consisting of different 
documents relating to the legal, economic and technical aspects of the 
transaction. 
ARTICLE  4.5 
(All terms to be given effect) 
Contract terms shall be interpreted so as to 
give effect to all the terms rather than to deprive 
some of them of effect. 
Art. 4.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
146 
COMMENT 
It is to be expected that when drafting their contract parties do not 
use words to no purpose. It is for this reason that this Article lays down 
the rule that unclear contract terms should be interpreted so as to give 
effect to all the terms rather than to deprive some of them of effect. The 
rule however comes into play only if the terms in question remain 
unclear notwithstanding the application of the basic rules of 
interpretation laid down in Articles 4.1 to 4.3.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, a commercial television network, enters into an agreement with 
B, a film distributor, for the periodic supply of a certain number of 
films to be transmitted on A’s network in the afternoon, when only 
those films that are admissible for all viewers may be transmitted. 
According to the contract the films submitted must “have passed the 
admission test” of the competent censorship commission. A dispute 
arises between A and B as to the meaning of this term. B maintains 
that it implies only that the films must have been released for 
circulation, even if they are X-rated, while A insists that they must 
have been classified as admissible for everybody. If it is not possible 
otherwise to establish the meaning to be attached to the term in 
question, A’s understanding prevails since B’s interpretation would 
deprive the provision of any effect. 
ARTICLE  4.6 
(Contra proferentem rule) 
If contract terms supplied by one party are 
unclear, an interpretation against that party is 
preferred. 
COMMENT 
A party may be responsible for the formulation of a particular 
contract term, either because that party has drafted it or otherwise 
supplied it, for example, by using standard terms prepared by others. 
Such a party should bear the risk of possible lack of clarity of the 
formulation chosen. It is for this reason that this Article states that if 
contract terms supplied by one party are unclear, there is a preference 
for their interpretation against that party. The extent to which this rule 
applies will depend on the circumstances of the case; the less the 
 
Interpretation 
Art. 4.7 
 
147 
contract term in question was the subject of further negotiations between 
the parties, the greater the justification for interpreting it against the 
party who included it in the contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A contract between A, a contractor, and B for the construction of an 
industrial plant contains a provision drafted by A and not discussed 
further stating that “[t]he Contractor shall be liable for and shall 
indemnify the Purchaser for all losses, expenses and claims in 
respect of any loss of or damage to physical property (other than the 
works), death or personal injury caused by negligence of the 
Contractor, its employees and agents”. One of A’s employees plays 
around with some of B’s equipment after working hours and 
damages it. A denies liability, contending that the provision in 
question covers only cases where A’s employees act within the scope 
of their employment. In the absence of any indication to the contrary, 
the provision will be interpreted in the manner which is less 
favourable to A, i.e. as also covering cases where its employees are 
not acting within the scope of their employment. 
ARTICLE  4.7 
(Linguistic discrepancies) 
Where a contract is drawn up in two or 
more language versions which are equally 
authoritative there is, in case of discrepancy 
between the versions, a preference for the 
interpretation according to a version in which the 
contract was originally drawn up. 
COMMENT 
International commercial contracts are often drawn up in two or 
more language versions which may diverge on specific points. 
Sometimes the parties expressly indicate which version shall prevail. If 
all versions are equally authoritative the question arises of how possible 
discrepancies should be dealt with. This Article does not lay down a 
hard and fast rule, but merely indicates that preference should be given 
to the version in which the contract was originally drawn up or, should it 
have been drawn up in more than one original language version, to one 
of those versions.

A and B, neither of them a native English speaker, negotiate 
and draw up a contract in English before translating it into their 
respective languages. The parties agree that all three versions are 
equally authoritative. In case of divergences between the texts, the 
English version will prevail unless circumstances indicate the 
contrary. 
A situation where a different solution may be preferable could arise 
where the parties have contracted on the basis of internationally and 
widely known instruments such as INCOTERMS or the Uniform 
Customs and Practices on Documentary Credits. In case of divergences 
between the different versions used by the parties it may be preferable to 
refer to yet another version if that version is much clearer than the ones 
used.

2. 
A contract between a company from country X and a company 
from country Y drawn up in three equally authoritative versions, the 
language of country X, the language of country Y and English, 
contains a reference to INCOTERMS 2010. If the French version of 
INCOTERMS is much clearer than the other three on a point in 
dispute, that version might be referred to. 
ARTICLE  4.8 
(Supplying an omitted term) 
(1) Where the parties to a contract have 
not agreed with respect to a term which is 
important for a determination of their rights and 
duties, a term which is appropriate in the 
circumstances shall be supplied. 
(2) In determining what is an appropriate 
term regard shall be had, among other factors, to 
(a) the intention of the parties; 
(b) the nature and purpose of the contract; 
(c) good faith and fair dealing; 
(d) reasonableness. 
 
Interpretation 
Art. 4.8 
 
149 
COMMENT 
1. Supplying of omitted terms and interpretation 
Articles 4.1 to 4.7 deal with the interpretation of contracts in the 
strict sense, i.e. with the determination of the meaning which should be 
given to contract terms which are unclear. This Article addresses a 
different though related issue, namely that of the supplying of omitted 
terms. Omitted terms or gaps occur when, after the conclusion of the 
contract, a question arises which the parties have not regulated in their 
contract at all, either because they preferred not to deal with it or simply 
because they did not foresee it. 
However, in other cases the parties may intentionally leave open 
terms, with the terms to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be 
determined by one of the parties or by a third person. This will occur 
with particular frequency in long-term contracts. If the parties fail to 
agree or the party or third person fails to determine the term, Article 
2.1.14 applies. 
2. When omitted terms are to be supplied 
In many cases of omitted terms or gaps in the contract the Principles 
will themselves provide a solution to the issue (see, for example, 
Articles 5.1.6 (Determination of quality of performance), 5.1.7 (Price 
determination), 6.1.1 (Time of performance), 6.1.4 (Order of 
performance), 6.1.6 (Place of performance) and 6.1.10 (Currency not 
expressed). See also, in general, Article 5.1.2 on implied obligations). 
However, even when there are such “gap-filling” solutions which may 
be generally applicable, they may not apply in a given case, particularly 
in long-term contracts because they would not provide a solution 
appropriate in the circumstances in view of the expectations of the 
parties or the special nature of the contract. This Article then applies, 
without prejudice to the application of Article 5.1.2, where appropriate. 
3. Criteria for the supplying of omitted terms 
The terms supplied under this Article must be appropriate to the 
circumstances of the case, particularly in relation to long-term contracts. 
In order to determine what is appropriate, regard is first of all to be had 
to the intention of the parties as inferred from, among other factors, the 
terms expressly stated in the contract, any preamble to the contract, 
Art. 4.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
150 
prior negotiations or any conduct subsequent to the conclusion of the 
contract.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
The parties to a construction contract agree on a special interest 
rate to be paid by the purchaser in the event of delay in payment of 
the price. Before the beginning of the work, the parties decide to 
terminate the contract. When the constructor delays restitution of the 
advance payment the question arises of the applicable interest rate. 
In the absence of an express term in the contract dealing with this 
question, the circumstances may make it appropriate to apply the 
special interest rate agreed for delay in payment of the price by the 
purchaser also to delay in restitution by the constructor. 
If the intention of the parties cannot be ascertained, the term to be 
supplied may be determined in accordance with the nature and purpose 
of the contract, and the principles of good faith and fair dealing and 
reasonableness. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A distribution franchise agreement provides that the franchisee 
may not engage in any similar business for a year after the 
termination of the agreement. Although the agreement is silent on 
the territorial scope of this prohibition, it is, in view of the particular 
nature and purpose of the franchise agreement, appropriate that the 
prohibition be restricted to the territory where the franchisee had 
exploited the franchise.

SECTION  1: CONTENT 
 
 
ARTICLE  5.1.1 
(Express and implied obligations) 
The contractual obligations of the parties 
may be express or implied. 
COMMENT 
This provision restates the widely accepted principle according to 
which the obligations of the parties are not necessarily limited to that 
which has been expressly stipulated in the contract. Other obligations 
may be implicit (see Article 5.1.2, Comments and Illustrations). 
Close links exist between this Article and some of the other 
provisions of the Principles. Thus Article 5.1.1 is a direct corollary of 
the rule according to which “[e]ach party must act in accordance with 
good faith and fair dealing in international trade” (Article 1.7). Insofar 
as the rules on interpretation (Chapter 4) provide criteria for filling 
lacunae (besides criteria for solving ambiguities), those rules may assist 
in determining the precise content of the contract and therefore in 
establishing the terms which must be considered as implied. 
ARTICLE  5.1.2 
(Implied obligations) 
Implied obligations stem from 
(a) the nature and purpose of the contract; 
(b) practices 
established

the 
parties and usages; 
(c) good faith and fair dealing; 
(d) reasonableness. 
Art. 5.1.3

COMMENT 
This Article describes the sources of implied obligations. Different 
reasons may account for the fact that they have not been expressly 
stated. The implied obligations may for example have been so obvious, 
given the nature or the purpose of the obligation, that the parties felt that 
the obligations “went without saying”. Alternatively, they may already 
have been included in the practices established between the parties or 
prescribed by trade usages according to Article 1.9. Yet again, they may 
be a consequence of the principles of good faith and fair dealing and 
reasonableness in contractual relations.

1. 
A rents a full computer network to B and installs it. The contract 
says nothing as to A’s possible obligation to give B at least some basic 
information concerning the operation of the system. This may however 
be considered to be an implied obligation since it is obvious, and 
necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose of such a contract, 
that the provider of sophisticated goods should supply the other party 
with a minimum of information (see Article 5.1.2(a)). 
2. 
A broker who has negotiated a charterparty claims the 
commission due. Although the brokerage contract is silent as to the 
time when the commission is due, the usages of the sector can 
provide an implied term according to which the commission is due, 
for example, only when the hire is earned, or alternatively when the 
charterparty was signed, regardless of whether or not the hire will 
effectively be paid (see Article 5.1.2(b)). 
3. 
A and B, who have entered into the negotiation of a co-
operation agreement, conclude an agreement concerning a complex 
feasibility study, which will be most time-consuming for A. Long 
before the study is completed, B decides that it will not pursue the 
negotiation of the co-operation agreement. Even though nothing has 
been stipulated regarding such a situation, good faith requires B to 
notify A of its decision without delay (see Article 5.1.2(c)). 
ARTICLE  5.1.3 
(Co-operation between the parties) 
Each party shall cooperate with the other 
party when such co-operation may reasonably be 
expected for the performance of that party’s 
obligations. 
 
Content 
Art. 5.1.3 
153 
COMMENT 
1. Duty of co-operation as an application of the general principle of 
good faith and fair dealing  
A contract is not merely a meeting point for conflicting interests but 
must also, to a certain extent, be viewed as a common project in which 
each party must cooperate. This view is clearly related to the principle 
of good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7) which permeates the law 
of contract, as well as to the obligation to mitigate harm in the event of 
non-performance (see Article 7.4.8). 
This Article states the parties’ duty to cooperate with each other to 
the extent that such co-operation may reasonably be expected for the 
performance of their respective obligations. Instances of such duty are 
expressly or implicitly provided for in the Principles either in the black-
letter rules (see Articles 5.3.3, 7.1.2, and 7.4.8) or in the comments (see, 
e.g., Comment 3 on Article 6.1.6, Comment 3(a) on Article 6.1.14, and 
Comment 10 on Article 7.1.4). However, there are many other instances 
in which the parties may be requested to cooperate with each other in 
the course of contract formation or contract performance.  
The duty of co-operation must of course be confined within certain 
limits, i.e. it only exists to the extent that co-operation may reasonably 
be expected to enable the other party to perform, without upsetting the 
allocation of duties in the contract. Within these limits each party may 
be under a duty not only to refrain from hindering the other party from 
performing its obligation(s), but also to take affirmative steps to enable 
the other party’s performance.   
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, an art gallery in country X, buys a sixteenth century painting 
from B, a private collector in country Y. The painting may not be 
exported without a special authorisation and the contract requires B 
to apply for that permission. B, who has no experience of such 
formalities, encounters serious difficulties with the application 
whereas A is familiar with such procedures. In these circumstances, 
and notwithstanding the contractual provision, A can be expected to 
give at least some assistance to B. 
 
2. 
Company A and Company B enter into a contract for the sale of 
electricity by A to B. The contract is not performed by B, prompting 
A to sue B for breach of contract and damages. B objects that the 
contract is null and void for lack of registration in the Public 
Art. 5.1.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
154 
Registry. According to the applicable law the registration of the 
contract is a joint task of the parties; since B has not done what it 
was required to do in order to obtain the registration, such 
registration could not be accomplished. B is not entitled to rely on 
the lack of registration of the contract, as a defence to A’s claim. 
 
3. 
Seller A, situated in country X, concludes with Buyer B, 
situated in country Y, a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered 
in instalments. After the discovery by B of alleged defects in part of 
the goods delivered, A agrees to a price reduction and an extension 
of payment dates, but in turn asks B promptly to submit a formal 
notice of the defects together with other documents A needs to 
explain to the export and exchange control authorities of its country 
the reasons for the reduced price and the extended dates of payment, 
so as to avoid severe penalties. Since B only gradually and partially 
meets A’s requests, A informs B that it will make the remaining 
deliveries conditional upon B’s submission of the requested 
documents and the prompt payment of the goods already delivered. 
B may not object that in so doing A was breaching the contract (and 
the subsequent agreement on the extension of payment), since it was 
B who with its obstructionist behaviour had failed to observe its 
general duty of co-operation under the contract. 
2. Co-operation between parties in the context of long-term 
contracts 
Although this Article states the duty of co-operation in general terms 
for all types of contract, in practice co-operation may be particularly 
important in the context of long-term contracts. Particularly contracts 
involving performance of a complex nature may especially need co-
operation throughout the life of the contract in order for the transaction 
to work, although always within the limit of reasonable expectations. 
Thus, by way of example, in a contract for the construction of industrial 
works the employer may be required to prevent interferences in the 
contractor’s work by other contractors it employs to carry out other 
works at the site. Likewise, in a distributorship agreement the supplier is 
under a duty to abstain from any conduct that might hinder the 
distributor from achieving the contractually-agreed minimum of orders, 
or in a franchising agreement the franchisor may be prevented from 
setting up a competing business in the immediate neighbourhood of the 
franchisee’s business even if the franchise is not exclusive.   
Obviously also in the context of long-term contracts the parties’ duty 
to cooperate exists only within the limit of reasonable expectations.

Contractor A is awarded by B, a Governmental Agency in 
country X, a contract to build a 3000 house complex in country X. 
Since it is a greenfield project, electricity and water also have to be 
brought in, and the respective works have to be executed in a certain 
sequence so as not to conflict with each other. B awards the 
electrical contracts to local contractors, but then completely fails to 
coordinate their work with A’s work with the result that A repeatedly 
has to interrupt its work thereby causing A considerable loss. B is 
liable for this loss since, in the circumstances, it should have actively 
coordinated the work of the local contractors so that A’s work would 
not be interrupted in such manner.  
5. 
Company A, situated in country X, and Company B, situated in 
country Y, enter into a joint venture agreement for participation in a 
public bidding procedure in country X. The contract is finally 
awarded to a third party. The procedure was manifestly improper, 
but B refuses to provide A with information necessary to appeal the 
award before the competent authority, thereby hindering A from 
pursuing the appeal. By its refusal, B has breached its general duty of 
co-operation to A under the joint venture agreement. 
ARTICLE  5.1.4 
(Duty to achieve a specific result. 
Duty of best efforts) 
(1) To the extent that an obligation of a 
party involves a duty to achieve a specific result, 
that party is bound to achieve that result. 
(2) To the extent that an obligation of a 
party involves a duty of best efforts in the 
performance of an activity, that party is bound to 
make such efforts as would be made by a 
reasonable person of the same kind in the same 
circumstances. 
Art. 5.1.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
156 
COMMENT 
1. Distinction between the duty to achieve a specific result and the 
duty of best efforts 
The degree of diligence required of a party in the performance of an 
obligation varies considerably depending upon the nature of the 
obligation incurred. Sometimes a party is bound only by a duty of best 
efforts. That party must then exert the efforts that a reasonable person of 
the same kind would exert in the same circumstances, but does not 
guarantee the achievement of a specific result. In other cases, however, 
the obligation is more onerous and such a specific result is promised. 
The distinction between a “duty to achieve a specific result” and a 
“duty of best efforts” corresponds to two frequent and typical degrees of 
severity in the assumption of a contractual obligation, although it does 
not encompass all possible situations. 
Obligations of both types may coexist in the same contract. For 
instance, a firm that repairs a defective machine may be considered to 
be under a duty of best efforts concerning the quality of the repair work 
in general, and under a duty to achieve a specific result as regards the 
replacement of certain spare parts. 
2. Distinction provides criteria for determining whether a party has 
performed its obligations 
Taken together, the two paragraphs of this Article provide judges and 
arbitrators with criteria by which correct performance can be evaluated. 
In the case of an obligation to achieve a specific result, a party is bound 
simply to achieve the promised result, failure to achieve which amounts 
in itself to non-performance, subject to the application of the force 
majeure provision (see Article 7.1.7). On the other hand, the assessment 
of non-performance of an obligation of best efforts calls for a less severe 
judgment, based on a comparison with the efforts a reasonable person of 
the same kind would have made in similar circumstances. This 
distinction signifies that more will be expected from a highly specialised 
firm selected for its expertise than from a less sophisticated partner.

1. 
A, a distributor, promises that it will reach a quota of 15,000 
sales within a year in the contract zone. If at the end of the period A 
has sold only 13,000 items, it has clearly failed to perform its 
obligation (see Article 5.1.4(1)).

Art. 5.1.5 
157 
2. 
B, another distributor, promises “to use our best efforts to 
expand the sales of the product” in the contract zone, without any 
stipulation that it must reach a minimum quantity. This provision 
creates an obligation of best efforts; it obliges B to take all the steps 
that a reasonable person, placed in similar circumstances (nature of 
the product, characteristics of the market, importance and experience 
of the firm, presence of competitors, etc.) would take to promote the 
sales (advertising, visits to customers, proper service, etc.). B does 
not promise the specific result of selling a certain number of items 
per year, but does undertake to do all that can be expected of it when 
acting as a reasonable person (see Article 5.1.4(2)). 
3.  Long-term contracts 
In international contract practice, especially in the context of long-
term contracts, when provision is made for parties to work together to 
resolve issues that may arise, it is common to speak of a duty “to use 
best efforts” to resolve such issues rather than a duty “to negotiate in 
good faith.” When the parties to a long-term contract have agreed on 
such a duty to use best efforts, that duty may amount, for all practical 
purposes, to a duty to negotiate in good faith (see Article 2.1.15, 
Comment 3).  
 
ARTICLE  5.1.5 
(Determination of kind of duty involved) 
In determining the extent to which an 
obligation of a party involves a duty of best 
efforts in the performance of an activity or a duty 
to achieve a specific result, regard shall be had, 
among other factors, to 
(a) the way in which the obligation is 
expressed in the contract; 
(b) the contractual price and other terms 
of the contract; 
(c) the degree of risk normally involved in 
achieving the expected result; 
(d) the ability of the other party to 
influence the performance of the obligation. 
Art. 5.1.5 
UNIDROIT Principles

COMMENT 
1. Criteria for determining the nature of the obligation 
It is important to determine whether an obligation involves a duty to 
achieve a specific result or simply a duty of best efforts, as the 
obligation is more onerous in the former case. Such a determination may 
sometimes be difficult. This Article therefore establishes criteria which 
may offer guidance to parties, judges and arbitrators, although the list is 
not exhaustive. The problems involved are frequently matters of 
interpretation. 
2. Nature of the obligation as expressed by the contract 
The way in which an obligation is expressed in the contract may 
often be of assistance in determining whether the parties intended to 
create a duty to achieve a specific result or a duty of best efforts. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a contractor, agrees to build storage facilities for B, who is 
most keen that the work be finished in an unusually short time. If A 
undertakes that “the work will be completed before 31 December”, it 
assumes an obligation to achieve the specific result of meeting that 
deadline. If it merely undertakes “to try to complete the work before 
31 December”, its obligation involves a duty of best efforts to 
attempt to meet the deadline, but no guarantee that it will definitely 
be met (see Article 5.1.5(a)). 
3. Price or other terms of the contract 
The contractual price or other terms of the contract may also offer 
clues as to the nature of an obligation. An unusually high price or 
another particular non-monetary reciprocal obligation may indicate a 
duty to achieve a specific result in cases where a mere duty of best 
efforts would normally be assumed. Clauses linking payment of the 
price to the successful outcome of the operation, penalty clauses 
applicable if the result is not achieved and hardship clauses enabling a 
party to adapt the contract if circumstances make it too harsh to perform 
as initially agreed are other examples of contractual terms which may - 
in one way or another - assist in determining the nature of the obligation 
in question (see Article 5.1.5(b)). 
4. Degree of risk in performance of an obligation 
When a party’s performance of an obligation normally involves a 
high degree of risk it is generally to be expected that that party does not 
 
Content 
Art. 5.1.6 
159 
intend to guarantee a result, and that the other party does not expect 
such a guarantee. The opposite conclusion will be drawn when the 
desired result can as a rule be achieved without any special difficulty 
(see Article 5.1.5(c)). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2. 
A space agency undertakes to put a telecommunication satellite 
into orbit, the rate of failure of past launchings having been 22%. 
The space agency cannot be expected to guarantee that the orbiting 
will be successful. The obligation is merely to observe the degree of 
diligence required for such launchings in view of the present state of 
technology. 
3. 
A promises to deliver 20 tons of steel to B on 30 June. Such a 
relatively simple operation is subject to no special risk. A is 
committed to the specific result of delivering the required quantity of 
steel on the date specified and not merely to attempting to do so. 
5. Influence of obligee over performance of an obligation 
In some situations one party may have a degree of influence over the 
performance of the other party’s obligations. This fact may transform 
into duties of best efforts obligations which might otherwise be 
characterised as duties to achieve specific results. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
A is prepared to provide B with the technical assistance 
necessary to apply a newly discovered chemical process, and it is 
agreed that B will send some of its engineers to attend training 
sessions organised by A. A cannot promise that the new process will 
be mastered by the other party, since that result depends in part on 
B’s effectively sending its engineers to the training sessions, on 
those engineers’ competence and on their attentiveness at the 
sessions (see Article 5.1.5(d)). 
ARTICLE  5.1.6 
(Determination of quality of performance) 
Where the quality of performance is neither 
fixed by, nor determinable from, the contract a 
party is bound to render a performance of a 
quality that is reasonable and not less than 
average in the circumstances. 
Art. 5.1.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
160 
COMMENT 
Standards have been set in Article 5.1.4 concerning the exercise of 
“best efforts”, but quality of performance is a wider problem addressed 
by Article 5.1.6. If goods are to be supplied, or services rendered, it is 
not sufficient to supply those goods or to render those services; they 
must also be of a certain quality. 
The contract will often be explicit as regards the quality due (“grade 
1 oil”), or it will provide elements making that quality determinable. In 
other cases, the rule established by Article 5.1.6 is that the quality must 
be “reasonable and not less than average in the circumstances”. Two 
criteria are thus combined. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A undertakes to build a hotel next to a busy railway station. The 
contract provides for “adequate sound isolation”, the quality of 
which is not more precisely determined. It is, however, determinable 
from the contract that the sound isolation must meet the high 
standards needed in view of the hotel’s proximity to a railway 
station. 
1. Performance must be of average quality 
The minimum requirement is that of providing goods of average 
quality. The supplier is not bound to provide goods or services of 
superior quality if that is not required by the contract, but neither may it 
deliver goods or services of inferior quality. This average quality is 
determined according to the circumstances, which normally means that 
which is available on the relevant market at the time of performance 
(there may for example have been a recent technological advance). 
Other factors may also be of relevance, such as the specific 
qualifications for which the performing party was chosen. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A buys 500 kgs. of oranges from B. If the contract says nothing 
more precise, and no other circumstances call for a different solution, 
those oranges may not be of less than average quality. Average 
quality will however suffice unless it is unreasonably defective. 
 
Content 
Art. 5.1.7 
161 
2. Performance must be reasonable 
The additional reference to reasonableness is intended to prevent a 
party from claiming that it has performed adequately if it has rendered 
an “average” performance in a market where the average quality is most 
unsatisfactory and is intended to give the judge or arbitrator an 
opportunity to raise those insufficient standards. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
A company based in country X organises a banquet to celebrate 
its 50th anniversary. Since the cuisine in country X is mediocre, the 
company orders the meal from a renowned restaurant in Paris. In 
these circumstances the quality of the food provided must not be less 
than the average standards of the Parisian restaurant. It would clearly 
not be sufficient simply to meet the average standards of country X. 
ARTICLE  5.1.7 
(Price determination) 
(1) Where a contract does not fix or make 
provision for determining the price, the parties 
are considered, in the absence of any indication to 
the contrary, to have made reference to the price 
generally charged at the time of the conclusion of 
the contract for such performance in comparable 
circumstances in the trade concerned or, if no 
such price is available, to a reasonable price. 
(2) Where the price is to be determined by 
one party and that determination is manifestly 
unreasonable, a reasonable price shall be 
substituted notwithstanding any contract term to 
the contrary. 
(3) Where the price is to be fixed by one 
party or a third person, and that party or third 
person does not do so, the price shall be a 
reasonable price. 
(4) Where the price is to be fixed by ref-
erence to factors which do not exist or have 
ceased to exist or to be accessible, the nearest 
equivalent factor shall be treated as a substitute. 
Art. 5.1.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
162 
COMMENT 
1. General rule governing price determination 
A contract usually fixes the price to be paid, or makes provision for 
its determination. If however this is not the case, paragraph (1) of this 
Article presumes that the parties have made reference to the price 
generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for such 
performance in comparable circumstances in the trade concerned. All 
these qualifications are of course significant. The provision also permits 
the rebuttal of the presumption if there is any indication to the contrary. 
This Article is inspired by Article 55 CISG. The rule has the 
necessary flexibility to meet the needs of international trade. 
It is true that in some cases the price usually charged on the market 
may not satisfy the reasonableness test which prevails elsewhere in this 
Article. Recourse would then have to be made to the general provision 
on good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7), or possibly to some of 
the provisions on mistake, fraud and gross disparity (see Chapter 3, 
Section 2). 
Some international contracts relate to operations which are unique or 
at least very specific, in respect of which it is not possible to refer to the 
price charged for similar performance in comparable circumstances. 
According to paragraph (1) the parties are then deemed to have made 
reference to a reasonable price and the party in question will fix the 
price at a reasonable level, subject to the possible review by courts or 
arbitral tribunals. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, a firm specialised in express mailing throughout the world, 
receives from B a parcel to be delivered as soon as possible from 
country X to country Y. Nothing is said as to the price. A should bill 
B with the price usually charged in the sector for such a service. 
2. 
The next order which A receives from B is one to deliver 
another parcel as soon as possible to remote and not easily accessible 
country Z, where a team of explorers is in need of urgent supplies. 
Again, nothing is said as to price, but since no possible market 
comparison can be made A must act reasonably when fixing the 
price. 
2. Determination of price by one party 
In some cases the contract expressly provides that the price will be 
determined by one of the parties. This happens frequently in several 
sectors, for example the supply of services. The price cannot easily be 
 
Content 
Art. 5.1.7 
163 
determined in advance, and the performing party is in the best position 
to place a value on what it has done. 
In those cases where the parties have made such a provision for 
determining the price, it will be enforced. To avoid possible abuses 
however, paragraph (2) enables judges or arbitrators to replace a mani-
festly unreasonable price by a reasonable one. This provision is 
mandatory. 
If the party does not determine the price, paragraph (3) provides that 
the price, possibly determined by judges or arbitrators, shall be 
reasonable. 
3. Determination of price by third person 
A provision that the price will be determined by a third person can 
give rise to serious difficulty if that third person is unable to accomplish 
the mission (not being the expert he or she was thought to be) or does 
not do so. Paragraph (3) provides that the price, possibly determined by 
judges or arbitrators, shall be reasonable. If the third person determines 
the price in circumstances that may involve fraud, threat or gross 
disparity, Article 3.2.8(2) may apply. 
The parties are free to fix the standards or procedure with which the 
third person must comply in determining the price. The parties can 
challenge the determination if it does not comply with those standards 
or that procedure. The parties may also set out the grounds on which the 
determination of a price by a third person can be challenged, which may 
vary depending on the nature of the determination. As an example, if the 
agreed standard concerns an opinion as to “market price” the parties 
may agree that the price determined by an expert can be challenged on 
the basis that it is “manifestly unreasonable”. In another case, if the 
standard concerns the ascertainment of a fact, such as “mid-point of an 
index”, the parties may agree the price can be challenged if it is 
“erroneous”. 
4. Determination of price by reference to external factors 
In some situations the price is to be fixed by reference to external 
factors, typically a published index, or quotations on a commodity 
exchange. In cases where the reference factor ceases to exist or to be 
accessible, paragraph (4) provides that the nearest equivalent factor shall 
be treated as a substitute.

The price of a construction contract is linked to several indexes, 
including the “official index of charges in the construction sector”, 
regularly published by the local Government. Several instalments of 
the price still have to be calculated when that index ceases to be 
published. The Construction Federation, a private trade association, 
decides however to start publishing a similar index to replace the 
former one and in these circumstances the new index will serve as a 
substitute. 
ARTICLE  5.1.8 
(Termination of a contract for an indefinite period) 
A contract for an indefinite period may be 
terminated by either party by giving notice a 
reasonable time in advance. As to the effects of 
termination in general, and as to restitution, the 
provisions in Articles 7.3.5 and 7.3.7 apply. 
COMMENT 
1. Contract for an indefinite period 
The duration of a contract is often specified by an express provision, 
or it may be determined from the nature and purpose of the contract 
(e.g. technical expertise provided in order to assist in performing 
specialised work). However, there are cases when the duration is neither 
determined nor determinable. Parties can also stipulate that their 
contract is concluded for an indefinite period. 
The Article provides that in such cases either party may terminate the 
contractual relationship by giving notice a reasonable time in advance. 
What a reasonable time in advance will be depends on circumstances 
such as the period of time the parties have been cooperating, the 
importance of their relative investments in the relationship, the time 
needed to find new partners, etc. 
The rule can be understood as a gap-filling provision in cases where 
parties have failed to specify the duration of their contract. More 
generally, it also relates to the widely recognised principle that contracts 
may not bind the parties eternally and that they may always opt out of 
such contracts provided they give notice a reasonable time in advance. 
 
Content 
Art. 5.1.8 
165 
This situation is to be distinguished from the case of hardship which 
is covered by Articles 6.2.1 to 6.2.3. Hardship requires a fundamental 
change of the equilibrium of the contract, and gives rise, at least in the 
first instance, to renegotiations. The rule in this Article requires no 
special condition to be met, except that the duration of the contract be 
indefinite and that it permit unilateral termination. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
A agrees to distribute B’s products in country X. The contract 
is concluded for an indefinite period. Either party may terminate the 
contract by giving the other party notice a reasonable time in 
advance. 
2.  Termination and its consequences 
The effects of termination in general are those set out in Article 
7.3.5. Both parties are released from their obligation to render and to 
receive future performance. 
The fact that, by virtue of termination, the contract is brought to an 
end does not deprive a party to the contract of its right to claim damages 
for any non-performance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. After the contract has 
been in operation for five years, B gives notice of termination. It is 
subsequently determined that, for a period of six months during the 
year before B had given notice of termination, A failed to discharge 
its obligations under the contract. As a result, B suffered a loss of 
income. Notwithstanding the termination, B may claim damages 
under the rules set out in Chapter 7, Section 4. 
 
Termination also does not affect any provision in the contract for the 
settlement of disputes or any other term of the contract which is to 
operate even after termination (see Comments 3 and 4 on Article 7.3.5). 
Performance of a contract for an indefinite period might have been 
made over a long period of time before the contract is terminated, and it 
may thus be inconvenient to unravel such performance. Furthermore, 
termination is a remedy with prospective effect only. Restitution can, 
therefore, be claimed only in respect of the period after termination. 
This is set out in Article 7.3.7(1), with the consequence that, as far as 
restitution has to be made, the provisions of Article 7.3.6 apply as set 
out in Article 7.3.7(2).

ARTICLE  5.1.9 
(Release by agreement) 
(1) An obligee may release its right by 
agreement with the obligor. 
(2) An offer to release a right gratuitously 
shall be deemed accepted if the obligor does not 
reject the offer without delay after having become 
aware of it. 
COMMENT 
An obligee may wish to release the obligor from its obligation (or, in 
case the obligor owes more than one obligation, from more than one or 
from all its obligations). The release may either be a separate act, or 
constitute a part of a more complex transaction between the parties, e.g. 
a compromise which settles a dispute between them. 
This Article provides that such renunciation of the obligee’s right(s) 
requires an agreement between the parties, irrespective of whether the 
obligee renounces its right(s) for value or gratuitously. 
In the latter case, while the obligor should not be compelled to accept 
a benefit against its will, it will normally consent to accepting the 
benefit. For this reason paragraph (2) provides that a gratuitous offer 
shall be deemed accepted if the obligor does not reject the offer without 
delay after having become aware of it.

SECTION  2:  THIRD PARTY RIGHTS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  5.2.1 
(Contracts in favour of third parties) 
(1) The parties (the “promisor” and the 
“promisee”) may confer by express or implied 
agreement a right on a third party (the 
“beneficiary”).  
(2) The existence and content of the 
beneficiary’s right against the promisor are 
determined by the agreement of the parties and 
are subject to any conditions or other limitations 
under the agreement. 
COMMENT 
Usually contracts are intended by the parties to create rights and 
obligations between themselves. In such cases only the parties will 
acquire rights and duties under the contract. The mere fact that a third 
party will benefit from the performance of the contract does not in itself 
give that third party any rights under the contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Professor A makes a contract with the University of country X 
under which he agrees to give forty one-hour lectures comparing the 
laws of contract of countries X and Y. A only appears for twenty 
lectures and does not mention the law of country Y in the lectures. T, 
a student, does not acquire rights under the contract between A and 
the University. 
However, third parties are not always left without rights. The 
underlying principle is that of the autonomy of the parties, who, if they 
wish to create rights in a third party, should be free to do so. The parties 
may state expressly that this is their intention, but this is not essential 
since the intention to benefit the third party may be implicit in the 
contract. In cases where implied intention is alleged, the decision will 
turn on all the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case. 
The following are illustrations of implied intention.

A takes out a policy of insurance on its fleet of lorries which 
are regularly driven by its employees. The contract provides that the 
insurance company will cover anyone driving a lorry with A’s 
consent. An employee, T, has an accident while driving the lorry. T 
is covered in respect of its liability for the accident. 
3. 
A sells his business to B on the terms that B will pay A GBP 
1,000 a month for the rest of his life and will pay A’s wife, T, GBP 
500 a month if A predeceases her. A dies. B refuses to pay T 
anything. T is entitled to the GBP 500 a month. 
4. 
A, the International World University, wishes to build a new 
law library on land owned by the University. For legitimate tax 
reasons the contract for the erection of the library is made by B, a 
company wholly owned by the University, although the contractor 
well knows that when completed the library will be occupied and 
used by A. The building has been badly built and it will cost USD 
5,000,000 to complete it satisfactorily. A can recover the cost of the 
remedial work. 
5. 
A, the developer of a shopping mall, concludes a contract with 
B, a security firm, to provide security at the mall. Both A and B 
know that the shops will be operated by tenants of A. These tenants 
are told that one of the major attractions of the mall will be the high 
level of security provided by B. It is a term of the contract between 
A and B that all employees of B working at the mall will be ex-
policemen personally selected by B’s chief executive. In fact, 
selection is delegated to a consultancy firm which recruits many 
unsuitable people. There are many thefts at the shops. Tenants who 
suffer losses will have contractual claims against B. 
The following are illustrations where there is no such implied 
intention unless the circumstances clearly indicate otherwise.

A goes to an expensive furrier and selects and buys a coat. A 
tells the assistant (truthfully) that it is for T, the wife of a visiting 
head of State. By the side of the coat is a prominent card saying “It 
looks like mink, it feels like mink but is guaranteed man made.” A 
gives the coat to T. In fact, owing to a mistake by the furrier, the coat 
is a real mink coat and T is subjected to violent and hostile criticism 
by animal lovers in her country. T has no enforceable contract right.

A, a company with a large factory, concludes a contract with a 
company operating the local sewage system. Under the contract, A is 
entitled to discharge its waste into the sewer but undertakes not to 
discharge certain types of waste. In breach of this undertaking, A 
discharges waste which blocks the sewer and causes damage to T, 
another user of the sewer. T has no enforceable contract right. 
8. 
A, a company from country X, sells materials to B, a company 
from country Y. A knows that B plans to resell the materials to T, a 
pharmaceutical company from country Z, which will use the 
materials for the manufacture of a new drug under a contract which 
will effectively limit B’s liability to T to USD 1,000,000. The 
materials are defective and T’s losses greatly exceed USD 1,000,000. 
T has no enforceable contract right against A. 
The application of this Article will often come up in the context of an 
associated claim in tort. This possibility is outside the scope of the 
Principles. 
It follows from the scheme of this Article that an express statement 
that the parties do not intend to create rights in a third party will be 
effective. It also follows that the promisor and promisee enjoy broad 
powers to shape the rights created in favour of the beneficiary. In this 
context the word “rights” should be interpreted liberally. In principle, a 
third party beneficiary will have the full range of contractual remedies 
including the right to performance and damages. 
ARTICLE  5.2.2 
(Third party identifiable) 
The beneficiary must be identifiable with 
adequate certainty by the contract but need not 
be in existence at the time the contract is made. 
COMMENT 
The parties may well wish to make a contract in which the identity of 
the third party is not known at the time the contract is made, but a 
mechanism is provided by which it will become known by the time 
performance is due. This might be by providing that the parties, or one 
of them, can identify the beneficiary at a later date, or by choosing a 
definition of the beneficiary, of which later circumstances will serve to 
make the identity clear.

Company A launches a takeover bid for company B, a public

to produce an honest, thorough and competent report. Owing to 
incompetence C produces a report that is much too favourable to B. As 
a result the majority of shareholders vote to reject A’s offer. Some 
shareholders show copies of the report to friends who buy shares in B. 
The old shareholders can acquire rights under the contract between B 
and C but the new shareholders cannot.

includes the right to invoke a clause in the 
contract which excludes or limits the liability of 
the beneficiary. 
COMMENT 
Contractual provisions limiting or excluding liability of those who are 
not parties to the contract are very common, particularly in contracts of 
carriage, where they often form part of a settled pattern of insurance. 
Perhaps the best known example is the so-called Himalaya clause, which 
in some form is frequently to be found in bills of lading. In general the 
autonomy of the parties should be respected in this area too. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, the owner of goods, makes a contract with a sea carrier to carry 
them from country X to country Y. The bill of lading is subject to the 
Hague-Visby Rules and purports to exclude the liability of (a) the 
master and crew; (b) stevedores employed in loading and unloading 
the cargo; and (c) the owners of ships onto which the goods may be 
transhipped. These exclusions will be effective. 
 
Third Party Rights 
Art. 5.2.4 
 
171 
Another situation which would be covered by this Article arises 
where the promisor and promisee agree that the beneficiary shall be 
released from an obligation which it owed the promisor.  
ARTICLE  5.2.4 
(Defences) 
The promisor may assert against the 
beneficiary all defences which the promisor could 
assert against the promisee. 
COMMENT 
Under Article 5.2.1 the content of the beneficiary’s right may be 
made subject to any conditions or limitations devised by the parties. The 
promisor and promisee may devise a contract in which the position of 
the beneficiary is significantly different from that of the promisee. The 
parties’ autonomy is in principle unlimited but they may well not 
provide expressly for all possibilities. The normal default rule will 
therefore be as stated in this Article. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A takes out a policy of life insurance with insurance company 
B in favour of C. The contract provides for the payment of premiums 
for 25 years but after 5 years A stops paying premiums. The position 
of C will be modelled on that of A if the policy had been in A’s 
favour. Such policies do not usually deny all return on the premiums 
paid. If, however, the policy had been liable to be set aside by the 
insurance company, for instance because A had not made material 
disclosure, then B would normally be entitled to raise this defence 
against C. 
2. 
Company A takes out a policy of fidelity insurance with 
insurance company B to cover dishonest employees. The insurance 
policy provides that B will indemnify in full customers who are 
defrauded by employees of A and that it will indemnify A only if A 
has not been negligent in the selection or supervision of the 
employees. Clearly in such a contract B will have defences against A 
which it cannot raise against the customers. 
Art. 5.2.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
172 
ARTICLE  5.2.5 
(Revocation) 
The parties may modify or revoke the 
rights conferred by the contract on the bene-
ficiary until the beneficiary has accepted them or 
reasonably acted in reliance on them. 
COMMENT 
It might be the rule that the promisor and promisee are free to revoke 
the third party’s rights at any time or, contrariwise, that the third party’s 
rights are immutable once the contract is concluded. It appears that few 
systems adopt either of these extreme positions. The solution adopted is 
that the third party’s rights become irrevocable once the third party has 
either accepted the rights or has reasonably acted in reliance on them. It 
will, of course, be open to the parties to provide for a different regime in 
the contract either by making the beneficiary’s rights irrevocable sooner, 
or by preserving a right of revocation even after the beneficiary has 
acted in reliance on the rights. There may well be situations where a 
right of revocation is given only to one party. For example, in a contract 
of life insurance it might be provided that the insured can change the 
beneficiary. There might be relevant usages which limit the possibility 
of revocation. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, the main contractor on a major construction contract, takes out a 
policy of insurance with insurance company B to cover damage to 
the work in progress. The policy is expressed to cover the interests of 
all sub-contractors involved in the contract and the sub-contractors 
are all told of the policy. C, a sub-contractor, does not take out any 
insurance itself, but does not tell A or B. Absent clear words to the 
contrary, C’s reliance makes the contract between A and B 
irrevocable. 
 
Third Party Rights 
Art. 5.2.6 
 
173 
ARTICLE  5.2.6 
(Renunciation) 
The beneficiary may renounce a right 
conferred on it. 
COMMENT 
The scheme of this Section assumes that, absent contrary provision, 
the contract between promisor and promisee creates rights in the 
beneficiary at once, without any need for acceptance by the beneficiary.  
Although the third party will usually welcome the benefit which the 
parties have conferred upon it, it cannot be forced to accept it. It follows 
that the third party may expressly or impliedly renounce the benefit. 
However, once the beneficiary has done something that amounts to 
acceptance, it should not normally be entitled to renounce. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
On the facts given in the Illustration to Article 5.2.5, C, a sub-
contractor, may not wish to take advantage of the insurance taken out 
by the main contractor because it already has relevant insurance in 
place (and it knows that there will be difficulties if there are two 
insurances covering the same risk). C is entitled to renounce.

SECTION  3: CONDITIONS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  5.3.1 
(Types of condition) 
A contract or a contractual obligation may 
be made conditional upon the occurrence of a 
future uncertain event, so that the contract or the 
contractual obligation only takes effect if the 
event occurs (suspensive condition) or comes to 
an end if the event occurs (resolutive condition).  
COMMENT 
1. Scope of this Section 
Parties to a contract may make their contract or one or several 
obligations arising under it dependent on the occurrence or non-
occurrence of a future uncertain event. A provision to this effect is 
called a condition. 
Conditions governed by the Principles include both those that 
determine whether a contract exists and those that determine obligations 
within a contract. Accordingly, application of the Principles may in 
some circumstances impose duties even in the absence of a contract 
(see, e.g., Articles 5.3.3 and 5.3.4). 
A condition may refer to a range of events, including natural events 
or acts of a third person.  
This Section only deals with conditions that originate in an 
agreement between the parties. 
Conditions imposed by law are not covered by this Section unless 
they are incorporated into the contract by the parties. Thus, a public 
permission requirement imposed by law is outside the scope of this 
Section but may be governed by Article 6.1.14. However, if the parties 
introduce a provision making the contract, or their contractual 
obligations arising under it, dependent upon a public permission being 
granted, then that provision is a condition. 
2. Notion of condition 
The word “condition” may have a number of meanings. For instance, 
in some jurisdictions condition means a major term of the contract. That 
is not the sense in which the term “condition” is used in this Section.
 
Conditions 
Art. 5.3.1 
 
175 
 
Some contracts may provide that the performance by one party is 
dependent upon the performance of the other party. These provisions are 
not conditions, they merely specify the obligations of both parties under 
their contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
In a share purchase and sale agreement concluded between 
seller A incorporated in country X, and purchaser B incorporated in 
country Y, B’s obligation to pay the agreed price is subject to A’s 
having “performed all of its obligations hereunder to be performed 
on or before a certain date”. This performance is not a condition, but 
a contractual obligation and as such is not an uncertain event. 
The parties may also fix a specific date at which the contract, or one 
or several of the obligations arising under it, is to take effect or is to 
come to an end. In many jurisdictions these provisions are referred to as 
“terms”. They are not conditions under this Section. The same holds 
true when the parties include a provision in their contract that makes the 
contract or one or several of the obligations arising under the contract 
dependent upon the occurrence of a future event that is bound to 
happen. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2.  
A contract of sale is concluded on 2 October, with the delivery 
of the goods to be made on 10 October. The obligation to deliver is 
not conditional because it is not subject to a future uncertain event. 
3.  
Architect A, who intends to renovate her offices, borrows money 
from a bank and the loan agreement provides that title to a particular 
property A owns will pass to the bank on A’s death. This is not a 
condition since A’s death is certain to occur.  
The parties may in their contract provide for a time by which the 
condition has to occur.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4.  
A share purchase agreement is concluded between A and B. It 
will take effect if all necessary authorisations are received by 30 
January. The agreement is conditional and it includes a date by 
which the condition has to occur if the parties’ obligations are to 
come into effect. 
If the contract does not state a specific time by which the condition 
must occur, in appropriate circumstances the time may be implied on the 
basis of an interpretation of the intentions of the parties under Chapter 4.  
Art. 5.3.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
176 
 
3. Suspensive and resolutive conditions 
A contract or contractual obligation can be made to depend upon the 
occurrence of a future uncertain event, so that it takes effect only if the 
event occurs. Under the Principles this is a suspensive condition. In some 
jurisdictions it is known as “condition precedent”. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
5.  
A merger contract is concluded between A and B subject to A’s 
having received the necessary antitrust clearance for the transaction 
from the relevant authorities before a specific date. 
A contract or a contractual obligation can be made to come to an end 
upon the occurrence of a future uncertain event. Under the Principles this 
is a resolutive condition. In some jurisdictions it is known as “condition 
subsequent”. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
6.  
A contract appointing B as a fund manager to manage the 
investments of a company provides that the agreement is to come to 
an end if B loses its licence to conduct the fund management 
business.  
Instead of agreeing on a resolutive condition, the parties to a contract 
may agree that one or both of them may, under certain circumstances, 
have the right to terminate the contract.  
4.  Condition entirely dependent on the will of the obligor 
Sometimes the contract or contractual obligation is made dependent 
upon an event which is entirely in the discretion of the obligor. In this 
case the question is of whether the obligor really wants to be bound. 
This is a question of interpretation. If it appears that there is no intention 
to be bound, there is no contract, nor is there any contractual obligation.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
7.  
A document drawn up between A and B contains a list of 
provisions. One of them states that a contract of sale will come into 
being if A decides to sell certain goods. A is under no obligation, not 
even a conditional one, in view of the fact that it is within A’s 
unfettered discretion to decide whether or not A wants to sell the 
goods. The fact that A may be under a pre-contractual obligation not 
to act in bad faith is irrelevant in this case.  
In some cases there is a conditional obligation in spite of the fact that 
one party has a choice whether or not to conclude the contract. This 
 
Conditions 
Art. 5.3.1 
 
177 
 
holds true when the freedom of choice is in actual fact dependent upon 
external factors. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
8.  
An international merger agreement provides for the merger 
within a certain period of time of two subsidiaries of a parent 
company, subject to approval by the Board of Directors of one of the 
companies. Under the applicable law the approval cannot be 
unreasonably withheld. There is a conditional obligation since the 
condition is not entirely dependent on the will of one of the parties.  
5.  Closing 
Parties to complex and high-value business transactions that involve 
prolonged negotiations frequently provide for a so-called “closing” 
procedure, i.e. the formal acknowledgement (“closing”) at a certain 
point in time (“closing date”) that on or before that date all the 
stipulated conditions (“conditions precedent”) have been satisfied. 
Normally, but not necessarily, on the “closing date” the parties will sign 
a document which confirms that no “condition precedent” survives or, if 
some conditions have not been satisfied, that they have been waived. 
Despite the terminology used by the parties, not all the events 
referred to as “conditions precedent” are “conditions" as defined by this 
Article. In actual practice, there are mixed provisions. Thus, for 
instance, events such as the receipt of all necessary antitrust clearances, 
the admittance to trading on a stock exchange, the granting of an export 
licence, and the obtaining of a bank loan, may be true suspensive 
conditions because they are events that are not certain to occur. Other 
terms such as the accuracy of one party’s representations or warranties, 
the commitment to perform or abstain from some specific acts, and the 
submission of a tax certificate that evidences that no taxes are due by 
the party concerned, are in fact obligations that the parties have agreed 
to fulfil before the formal conclusion (“completion”) of the transaction. 
These are not events that are uncertain to occur and, therefore, these 
provisions are not conditions under the Principles.  
Also, with respect to the effects of a “closing”, there is no clear-cut 
rule as to whether or not a term is a condition. In practice it is difficult 
to derive a logical answer from the clauses themselves. In particular, 
clauses named “conditions precedent” often mix up real conditions and 
specific matters that still need to be agreed upon or real obligations that 
the parties must fulfil in the course of the negotiations (see Article 
2.1.13). 
Art. 5.3.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
178 
 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
9.  
A Share Capital Increase Agreement negotiated between issuer 
A and lead manager B under the heading “Conditions precedent” 
provides as follows:  
“The obligation of the Lead Manager at the closing date to subscribe 
for the shares is subject to the realisation of the following conditions 
precedent on or prior to the closing date:  
a.  
Accuracy of representations and warranties; 
b.  
Performance of undertakings: the Issuer has performed all 
of those of its obligations hereunder to be performed on or 
before the closing date; 
c.  
Admittance to trading on stock exchange; 
d.  
Delivery of any and all closing documents: the Lead 
Manager shall have received the following documents on or 
before the closing date [...]. 
If any one of the above conditions has not been satisfied at the time it 
should have been satisfied pursuant to this Section, the obligations of 
the Lead Manager may be terminated by the Lead Manager.” 
In this Illustration, the contract consists of a mixture of legal 
obligations and suspensive conditions: item (c) is a suspensive 
condition, as it is outside the control of the parties; items (a) and (b) 
embody contractual obligations; and item (d) embodies a contractual 
obligation as regards the documents a party is under an obligation to 
procure but a suspensive condition as regards other documents. 
ARTICLE  5.3.2 
(Effect of conditions) 
Unless the parties otherwise agree: 
(a)  the relevant contract or contractual 
obligation takes effect upon fulfilment of a 
suspensive condition; 
(b)  the relevant contract or contractual 
obligation comes to an end upon fulfilment of a 
resolutive condition.

COMMENT 
1.  A general default rule 
Under the Principles, unless the parties otherwise agree, the 
fulfilment of a condition has prospective effect only. It does not operate 
retroactively. 
Parties are encouraged to express whether a condition operates 
retroactively or prospectively. 
2.  No retroactive effect  
In the case of a suspensive condition, the contract or contractual 
obligation automatically becomes effective from the moment the future 
uncertain event occurs. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 5 to Article 5.3.1. The 
contract takes effect if and when the necessary antitrust clearance is 
obtained. 
In the case of a resolutive condition, the contract or contractual 
obligation comes to an end from the moment the future uncertain event 
occurs. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 6 to Article 5.3.1. The 
contract comes to an end if and when B loses its licence. 
ARTICLE  5.3.3 
(Interference with conditions) 
(1)  If fulfilment of a condition is prevented 
by a party, contrary to the duty of good faith and 
fair dealing or the duty of co-operation, that 
party may not rely on the non-fulfilment of the 
condition. 
(2)  If fulfilment of a condition is brought 
about by a party, contrary to the duty of good 
faith and fair dealing or the duty of co-operation, 
Art. 5.3.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
180 
 
that party may not rely on the fulfilment of the 
condition. 
COMMENT 
This Article on interference with conditions is a specific application 
of the general rules on good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7), 
inconsistent behaviour (see Article 1.8) and co-operation between the 
parties (see Article 5.1.3). 
Under this Article, the party is not under an obligation to use all 
reasonable efforts to bring about the fulfilment of the condition. This 
Article merely states that the party who, contrary to the duties of good 
faith and fair dealing or co-operation, prevents the condition from being 
fulfilled may not rely on the non-fulfilment of the condition. If, on the 
contrary, the party brings about the fulfilment of a condition contrary to 
the duties of good faith and fair dealing or co-operation, that party may 
not rely on the fulfilment of the condition.  
Whether or not a party is under an obligation to use all reasonable 
efforts to bring about the fulfilment of a condition is a matter of 
interpretation. In commercial practice, the parties themselves may 
expressly provide for the observance of the principle of good faith as 
regards all the events upon which completion of the transaction is 
conditional or go beyond this minimum standard and impose a duty to 
use “their best efforts to bring about the fulfilment of the conditions as 
soon as practicable”. These clauses may also be imposed on one party 
only (see Article 5.1.4). 
The available remedies (right to performance or damages) are to be 
determined in accordance with the contractual provisions and the 
general rules on these remedies, as well as with the particular 
circumstances of the case.  
Four factual situations can be distinguished to illustrate the operation 
of this Article. 
(a)  Where the fulfilment of a suspensive condition is prevented by a 
party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of 
cooperation, that party may not rely on the non-fulfilment of the 
condition. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
The licensing of software by B to A is agreed by the parties to 
be dependent upon the professional approval of the software by an 
independent computer engineer, C, who is nominated by B. B regrets 
the bargain and bribes C not to approve the software. Because of the 
 
Conditions 
Art. 5.3.3 
181 
 
bribe, C states that it does not approve the software. B is not allowed 
to rely on the non-fulfilment of the condition, i.e. B  cannot refuse to 
perform the obligation under the contract when asked by A to do so. 
(b)  Where the fulfilment of a resolutive condition is prevented by a 
party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty of 
cooperation, that party may not rely on the non-fulfilment of the 
condition. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
A hires earth-moving equipment from B for the time necessary 
for A to purchase its own equipment. As a commercial favour to A, 
the rate of hire is below the market rate. B’s obligation to make the 
earth-moving equipment available is subject to the resolutive 
condition that it comes to an end if A acquires its own earth-moving 
equipment. A turns down very attractive offers in order to continue 
benefiting from the favourable rate of hire. A may not rely on the 
non-fulfilment of the condition. 
(c)  Where the fulfilment of a suspensive condition is brought about 
by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty 
of cooperation, that party may not rely on the fulfilment of the 
condition. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B bribes 
C to give its approval of the software despite C’s professional 
misgivings about the software. B is not allowed to rely on the 
fulfilment of the condition, i.e. B cannot ask A to perform the 
contract. 
(d)  Where the fulfilment of a resolutive condition is brought about 
by a party contrary to the duty of good faith and fair dealing or the duty 
of cooperation, that party may not rely on the fulfilment of the 
condition. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
A appoints B as its agent for the promotion and sale of A’s 
products. The agreement is to come to an end if the gross amount of 
sales made by B fails to reach EUR 1,000,000 by 31 December the 
second year. A, who has found another party willing to act as agent 
on terms more favourable to A than B, withholds supplies to B with 
the result that by the above date B’s gross sales fall well short of 
EUR 1,000,000. A may not rely on this to treat the agreement with B 
as having come to an end. 
Art. 5.3.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
182 
 
ARTICLE  5.3.4 
(Duty to preserve rights) 
Pending fulfilment of a condition, a party 
may not, contrary to the duty to act in accordance 
with good faith and fair dealing, act so as to 
prejudice the other party’s rights in case of 
fulfilment of the condition. 
COMMENT 
 
This Article only relates to the acts performed during the period that 
precedes the time when the condition is fulfilled. It does not concern 
acts which amount to an interference with conditions. These acts are 
dealt with by Article 5.3.3.  
The situation in which fulfilment of the condition is pending is 
specific and deserves special treatment in application of the general 
principle of good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7). Indeed, a 
person who would benefit from the fulfilment of a condition has a 
conditional right which deserves protection (particularly in the case of a 
suspensive condition). During the period pending fulfilment of the 
condition one party’s actions may detrimentally affect the other party’s 
position. This Article assumes that it is generally better to prevent such 
actions than to cure their effects. 
This Article is also important as a reminder to the parties to consider 
this issue and even state expressly what measures the person who would 
benefit from the fulfilment of the condition might take in order to 
preserve its rights. In commercial practice parties may draft a specific 
provision (sometimes known as “covenant of ordinary course of 
business”) that produces effects between the date of signature and the 
“closing date” and restricts the parties’ right to dispose of assets only to 
those transactions that fall within the ordinary course of business. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A share purchase agreement entered into between the seller A and 
the purchaser B provides that the transaction will be completed only 
if, at the closing date, all the conditions have been met, including B’s 
having obtained the necessary credit from its banks. A is bound to 
restrict its activity to ordinary business management and B is under a 
 
Conditions 
Art. 5.3.5

duty of confidentiality as to any information concerning the 
company that it has received in the course of negotiations. 
ARTICLE  5.3.5 
(Restitution in case of fulfilment of a  
resolutive condition) 
(1) On fulfilment of a resolutive condition, 
the rules on restitution set out in Articles 7.3.6 
and 7.3.7 apply with appropriate adaptations. 
(2) If the parties have agreed that the 
resolutive condition is to operate retroactively, 
the rules on restitution set out in Article 3.2.15 
apply with appropriate adaptations.  
COMMENT  
When a contract subject to a resolutive condition comes to an end as 
a result of the fulfilment of the resolutive condition, the parties will 
often have performed, fully or in part, their obligations under the 
contract. The question then arises whether and, if so, under which rules, 
the parties have to make restitution of what they have received. 
Under the Principles, the fulfilment of a resolutive condition 
normally has prospective effects only. For this reason restitution will 
have to follow the regime set out in Articles 7.3.6 and 7.3.7 on 
restitution following the termination of a contract, which also operates 
only prospectively. The specificity of this restitution regime vis-à-vis 
the restitution regime set out in Article 3.2.15 is that for contracts to be 
performed over a period of time, restitution cannot be claimed for the 
period prior to the moment when the contract came to an end. 
However, under the Principles parties are free to determine that a 
resolutive condition is to operate retroactively. Under these 
circumstances it appears to be appropriate to apply the restitution regime 
set out in Article 3.2.15 (restitution following avoidance), since 
avoidance also operates retroactively. There is no special rule for 
restitution in the case of contracts performed over a period of time.

CHAPTER  6 
 
 
 
PERFORMANCE 
 
 
 
SECTION  1:  PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  6.1.1 
(Time of performance) 
A party must perform its obligations: 
(a) if a time is fixed by or determinable 
from the contract, at that time; 
(b) if a period of time is fixed by or 
determinable from the contract, at any time 
within that period unless circumstances indicate 
that the other party is to choose a time; 
(c) in any other case, within a reasonable 
time after the conclusion of the contract. 
COMMENT 
With a view to determining when a contractual obligation is to be 
performed, this Article, which is inspired by Article 33 CISG, distin-
guishes three situations. The first is where the contract stipulates the 
precise time for performance or makes it determinable. If the contract 
does not specify a precise moment but a period of time for performing, 
any time during that period chosen by the performing party will be 
acceptable unless circumstances indicate that the other party is to choose 
the time. Finally, in all other cases, performance is due within a 
reasonable time. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A offers to advise B in the latter’s plans to buy computer 
equipment and software and it is agreed that A’s experts will visit B 
“in May”. It is in principle for A to announce when precisely in 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.2 
 
185 
May that visit will take place. The circumstances may however leave 
the option to B, as would be the case if the contract expressly left to B 
the choice of the precise dates, or where, for example, it was 
understood that some of B’s staff who are often absent on business 
trips must be present when A’s experts arrive (see Article 6.1.1(b)). 
2. 
A, a building contractor, encounters unusual difficulties when 
excavating a site and needs special equipment to continue the work 
which it does not have. A immediately telephones B, another 
contractor, who has the necessary equipment and agrees to lend it to 
A. Nothing however is said as to when the equipment should be 
delivered to A. Performance is then to take place “within a 
reasonable time” in the circumstances. Since the work has been 
interrupted because of the above-mentioned difficulties, A urgently 
needs to receive the equipment and in such a case “within a 
reasonable time” probably means that performance is due almost 
immediately (see Article 6.1.1(c)). 
ARTICLE  6.1.2 
(Performance at one time or in instalments) 
In cases under Article 6.1.1(b) or (c), a 
party must perform its obligations at one time if 
that performance can be rendered at one time 
and the circumstances do not indicate otherwise. 
COMMENT 
A party’s performance is of necessity sometimes rendered at one 
time (e.g. delivery of a single object), or, alternatively, must take place 
over a period of time (e.g. construction). There are however also cases 
where it can be rendered either at one time or in instalments (e.g. 
delivery of quantities of goods). This Article addresses the latter 
situation, in circumstances where there is no contractual provision as to 
how such performance should be rendered, or where it is not de-
terminable from the contract. The principle stated is that performance is 
due at one time, unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A promises to deliver 100 tons of coal to B “in March”. It 
would be materially possible and perhaps convenient for A to deliver

must deliver the 100 tons at one time.

The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B needs 
the coal gradually, to meet the needs of its operations. B also has 
limited storage facilities and could not cope adequately with a 
consignment of 100 tons at any one time. A knows of B’s specific 
needs. Here the circumstances suggest that A should deliver in 
instalments during the month of March. 
ARTICLE  6.1.3 
(Partial performance) 
(1) The obligee may reject an offer to 
perform in part at the time performance is due, 
whether or not such offer is coupled with an 
assurance as to the balance of the performance, 
unless the obligee has no legitimate interest in so 
doing. 
(2) Additional expenses caused to the obli-
gee by partial performance are to be borne by the 
obligor without prejudice to any other remedy. 
COMMENT 
1. Partial performance distinguished from performance at one time 
or in instalments 
The situation covered by this Article should be distinguished from 
that of Article 6.1.2. 
Article 6.1.2 attempts to solve a preliminary question which concerns 
only certain special cases. If a party’s performance can be rendered at 
one time or in instalments and if the contract does not make it clear or 
determinable how that party is to perform, it must in principle perform 
at one time. 
This Article has a more general scope. It provides that at the time 
performance is due the obligee may in principle reject an offer of partial 
performance. This applies at maturity, irrespective of whether what is 
due then is a global performance or an instalment of a wider obligation 
(which, in some cases, has been previously determined on the basis of 
Article 6.1.2).

1. 
A owes USD 1,000,000 to a bank and it has been agreed that A 
will pay back USD 100,000 on the first day of each month, starting 
in January. On 1 April A offers to reimburse only USD 50,000, and 
the balance two weeks later. In principle, the bank is entitled to 
refuse A’s proposal. 
2. Obligee entitled in principle to reject partial performance 
When performance is due at maturity (be it the whole performance or 
an instalment), that which is due must be performed completely. In 
principle, the obligee may reject an offer of partial performance, 
whether or not it is coupled with an assurance as to the balance of the 
performance, since it is entitled to receive the whole of what was 
stipulated. Subject to what will be said below, partial performance 
normally constitutes a breach of contract. A party who does not obtain 
full performance at maturity may resort to the available remedies. As a 
rule, the obligee has a legitimate interest in requiring full performance of 
what was promised at the time that performance is due. 
The obligee may of course also refrain from rejecting the offer to 
perform in part, while reserving its rights as to the breach, or may accept 
it without any reservation, in which case partial performance can no 
longer be treated as a non-performance.

A wishes to open a branch office in country X and rents the 
necessary office space in a building under construction, due to be 
finished in time for the move on 1 September. On that date, only four 
of the ten offices are made available to A, with an assurance that the 
remaining six will be ready in one month. In principle, A may refuse 
to move into those four offices. 
3. Obligee’s right to reject partial performance conditional on its 
legitimate interest in so doing 
There may be situations where the obligee’s legitimate interest in 
receiving full performance is not apparent and where temporary 
acceptance of partial performance will not cause any significant harm to 
the obligee. If the party tendering partial performance proves this to be 
the case, the obligee cannot then refuse such partial performance 
(subject to paragraph (2)), and there is no non-performance in such 
cases. This may be seen as a consequence of the general principle of 
good faith and fair dealing enunciated in Article 1.7.

An airline promises to transport 10 automobiles from Italy to 
Brazil in one single consignment due to be delivered on a definite 
date. When performance is due, some circumstances make it 
difficult, although not impossible, for the airline to find sufficient 
space in a single aircraft. The airline suggests making two successive 
deliveries within a week. It is established that this will cause no 
inconvenience to the purchaser of the cars, which will not actually be 
used before the following month. In such a case the obligee has no 
legitimate interest in refusing partial performance. 
4. Additional expenses entailed by partial performance to be borne 
by obligor 
If partial performance is accepted, it may entail additional expenses 
for the obligee. In all cases, such expenses are to be borne by the other 
party. If partial performance amounts to a non-performance (as it 
usually does), these expenses will be part of the damages, without 
prejudice to any other available remedy. If partial performance does not 
amount to a non-performance (the obligee has been shown not to have 
any legitimate interest in rejecting the offer of partial performance, or 
has found the offer to be acceptable without reservation), it will only be 
entitled to those expenses. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n

The facts are the same as in Illustration 3. If the purchaser has 
to meet additional expenses on account of having to make double 
arrangements for picking up the cars at the airport, those extra costs 
will be borne by the airline. 
ARTICLE  6.1.4 
(Order of performance) 
(1) To the extent that the performances of 
the parties can be rendered simultaneously, the 
parties are bound to render them simultaneously 
unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
(2) To the extent that the performance of 
only one party requires a period of time, that 
party is bound to render its performance first, 
unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.

COMMENT 
In bilateral contracts, where each of the parties has an obligation 
towards the other, the basic but complex question arises of which party 
is to perform first. If the parties have not made any specific 
arrangements, then in practice much will depend on usages and it must 
also be recalled that there are often several obligations on each side 
which may have to be performed at different times. 
This Article states two broad principles, while recognising that in 
both cases the circumstances may indicate otherwise. In effect, the main 
purpose of this Article is to draw the parties’ attention to the problem of 
order of performance, and to encourage them, where necessary, to draft 
appropriate contractual provisions. 
A distinction is drawn between cases where the parties’ 
performances can be rendered simultaneously and those where the 
performance of only one party requires a period of time. 
1. Simultaneous performance to be made when possible 
In the first situation, the rule is that the parties are bound to perform 
simultaneously (paragraph (1)). A seller is entitled to payment on 
delivery but circumstances may indicate otherwise, for example any 
exception originating from the terms of the contract or from usages 
which may allow a party to perform some time after the other. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A and B agree to barter a certain quantity of oil against a 
certain quantity of cotton. Unless circumstances indicate otherwise, 
the commodities should be exchanged simultaneously. 
2. Exception where performance requires a period of time 
If the performance of only one party’s obligation by its very nature 
requires a period of time, for example in construction and most service 
contracts, the rule established in paragraph (2) is that that party is bound 
to render its performance first. Circumstances may frequently however 
indicate the contrary. Thus, insurance premiums are normally paid in 
advance, as also are rent and freight charges. In construction contracts, 
payments are usually made in agreed instalments throughout the 
duration of the work.

A promises to write a legal opinion to assist B in an arbitration. If 
no arrangement is made as to when A should be paid for the services, 
A must prepare the opinion before asking to be paid. 
3. Relation of order of performance to withholding of performance 
This Article sets out the rules which will condition the application of 
Article 7.1.3 concerning the withholding of performance. 
ARTICLE  6.1.5 
(Earlier performance) 
(1) The obligee may reject an earlier 
performance unless it has no legitimate interest in 
so doing. 
(2) Acceptance by a party of an earlier 
performance does not affect the time for the 
performance of its own obligations if that time 
has been fixed irrespective of the performance of 
the other party’s obligations. 
(3) Additional expenses caused to the 
obligee by earlier performance are to be borne by 
the obligor, without prejudice to any other 
remedy. 
COMMENT 
1. Obligee in principle entitled to reject earlier performance 
When performance is due at a certain moment (to be determined in 
accordance with Article 6.1.1), it must take place at that time and in 
principle the obligee may reject an earlier performance. Usually, the 
time set for performance is geared to the obligee’s activities, and earlier 
performance may cause it inconvenience. The obligee has therefore a 
legitimate interest in refusing it. Earlier performance, in principle, 
constitutes non-performance of the contract. 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.5 
 
191 
The obligee may of course also abstain from rejecting an earlier 
performance while reserving its rights as to the non-performance. It may 
also accept such performance without reservation, in which case earlier 
performance can no longer be treated as non-performance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A agrees to carry out the annual maintenance of all lifts in B’s 
office building on 15 October. A’s employees arrive on 14 October, 
a day on which important meetings, with many visitors, are taking 
place in the building. B is entitled to refuse such earlier performance 
which would cause it obvious inconvenience. 
2. Obligee’s right to reject earlier performance conditional on its 
legitimate interest in so doing 
Situations may arise in which the obligee’s legitimate interest in 
timely performance is not apparent and when its accepting earlier 
performance will not cause it any significant harm. If the party offering 
earlier performance proves this to be the case, the other party cannot 
reject earlier performance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that neither 14 
nor 15 October has any special significance. A can probably prove 
that B has no legitimate interest in refusing the earlier performance. 
3. Effect of acceptance by obligee on its own performance of earlier 
performance of the other party’s obligations 
If one party accepts earlier performance by the other, the question 
arises of whether this affects the time for performance of its own 
obligations. Paragraph (2) deals with cases where obligations are due at 
a certain time which is not linked to the performance of the other party’s 
obligations; that time for performance remains unchanged. 
This provision does not however deal with the converse case where 
the performances are linked in time. Several situations may then arise. 
This circumstance may in itself establish the obligee’s legitimate 
interest in rejecting earlier performance. If earlier performance is thus 
rejected, the obligee’s time of performance is unaffected. If earlier 
performance is accepted with all due reservations as to the non-
performance involved, the obligee may also reserve its rights as to its 
Art. 6.1.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
192 
time for performance. If earlier performance is acceptable to the obligee 
it may at the same time decide whether or not to accept the 
consequences as regards its own obligations.

3. 
B undertakes to deliver goods to A on 15 May and A to pay the 
price on 30 June. B wishes to deliver the goods on 10 May and A has 
no legitimate interest in refusing such earlier performance. This will 
however have no effect on the time agreed for payment of the price, 
which was determined irrespective of the date of delivery. 
4. 
B undertakes to deliver goods to A on 15 May and A to pay the 
price “on delivery”. If B tenders the goods on 10 May, A, depending 
on the circumstances, may reject such earlier performance, claiming 
that it is not in a position to pay at that date, take delivery of the 
goods subject to observing the original deadline for payment of the 
price, or decide to accept the goods and pay for them immediately. 
4. Additional expenses entailed by earlier performance to be borne 
by the performing party 
If earlier performance is accepted, it may entail additional expenses 
for the obligee. In all cases, such expenses are to be borne by the other 
party. If earlier performance amounts to non-performance (the normal 
case), those expenses will be part of the damages, without prejudice to 
any other remedy available. If earlier performance does not amount to 
non-performance (the obligee has been shown not to have any legitimate 
interest in rejecting the offer of earlier performance, or has found that 
offer to be acceptable without reservation), the obligee will only be 
entitled to those expenses. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n

A has no legitimate interest in refusing delivery of goods on 10 
May instead of 15 May, but some additional storage fees are payable 
for those five extra days. Those costs will be borne by B.

ARTICLE  6.1.6 
(Place of performance) 
(1) If the place of performance is neither 
fixed by, nor determinable from, the contract, a 
party is to perform: 
(a) a monetary obligation, at the obligee’s 
place of business; 
(b) any other obligation, at its own place of 
business. 
(2) A party must bear any increase in the 
expenses incidental to performance which is 
caused by a change in its place of business 
subsequent to the conclusion of the contract. 
COMMENT 
1. Place of performance fixed by, or determined from, the contract 
when possible 
The place where an obligation is to be performed is often determined 
by an express term of the contract or is determinable from it. It is 
obvious, for instance, that an obligation to build must be performed on 
the construction site, and that an obligation to transport goods must be 
performed in accordance with the agreed route. 
2. Need for suppletive rules 
Rules are however needed to cover cases in which the contract is 
silent on the matter and circumstances do not indicate where 
performance should take place. Paragraph (1) provides two solutions. 
The general rule is that a party is to perform its obligations at its own 
place of business. The second rule is specific to monetary obligations 
where the converse solution applies, namely that the obligor is to 
perform its obligations at the obligee’s place of business (subject to the 
application of Article 6.1.8 concerning payments by funds transfers). 
These solutions may not be the most satisfactory in all cases, but 
they do reflect the need for rules where the parties have not made any 
other arrangement or where the circumstances do not indicate otherwise.

A wishes some of its engineers to learn the language of country 
X, where they will be employed for some time. It agrees with B, a 
language school, for a series of intensive lessons. If nothing else is 
stipulated, the lessons are to take place at B’s place of business (see 
Article 6.1.6(1)(b)). 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. The language school 
sends its bill to A. The cost of the lessons must, in principle, be paid 
at B’s place of business (see Article 6.1.6(1)(a)). 
3. Consequences of change in a party’s place of business 
subsequent to conclusion of contract 
In view of the importance of the parties’ respective places of 
business for the application of paragraph (1), it is necessary to cater for 
the situation where a party changes its location after the conclusion of 
the contract, a move which may involve additional expense for the 
performing party. The rule established in paragraph (2) is that each party 
must bear any such increase of expenses occasioned by a change in its 
place of business. 
It is moreover possible that a party’s move may entail other 
inconvenience for the other party. The obligation to act in good faith 
(Article 1.7) and the duty to cooperate (Article 5.1.3) will often impose 
on the moving party an obligation to inform the other party in due time 
so as to enable the latter to make such arrangements as may be 
necessary.

3. 
A enters into a technical assistance agreement with B, under the 
terms of which A undertakes to train ten of B’s engineers for a 
period of two months on A’s premises. The engineers are to be 
accommodated at a local hotel which offers very reasonable rates on 
account of A’s location in a rural area. After the agreement has been 
concluded, but before B’s engineers arrive, A notifies B that it has 
moved to the capital city where hotel rates are much higher. 
Irrespective of whether the initial costs of accommodation were to be 
paid by A or by B, the additional costs will be borne by A. 
4. 
Each year on 3 May, A must pay royalties to B at B’s place of 
business. B moves to another country, to which it takes some time 
(e.g. two months) for a payment to arrive. A formerly gave its bank 
the transfer order on or about 15 April, but from now on the order 
must be given towards the end of March at the latest if A 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.7 
 
195 
wishes to avoid late payment. B is under a duty to inform A of its 
new place of business in sufficient time to permit A to make the 
necessary arrangements for payment and B will bear the additional 
costs. 
ARTICLE  6.1.7 
(Payment by cheque or other instrument) 
(1) Payment may be made in any form 
used in the ordinary course of business at the 
place for payment. 
(2) However, an obligee who accepts, 
either by virtue of paragraph (1) or voluntarily, a 
cheque, any other order to pay or a promise to 
pay, is presumed to do so only on condition that it 
will be honoured. 
COMMENT 
Discharge of monetary obligations is frequently made by cheques or 
similar instruments, or by transfers between financial institutions. The 
problems involved have however very seldom been the subject of 
codification, one notable exception being the UNCITRAL Model Law on 
International Credit Transfers. Without attempting to provide a detailed 
regulation, which would not be compatible with the very rapid evolution 
of techniques in this field, Articles 6.1.7 and 6.1.8 establish some basic 
principles which should be of assistance in regard to international 
payments. 
1. General rule regarding form of payment 
Paragraph (1) allows for payment to be made in any form that is 
usual at the place for payment. Subject to the reservation contained in 
paragraph (2), the obligor may for instance pay in cash, by cheque, 
banker’s draft, a bill of exchange, credit card, or in any other form such 
as the newly developing electronic means of payment, provided it 
chooses a mode that is usual at the place for payment, i.e. normally at 
the obligee’s place of business. In principle, the obligee should be 
satisfied to receive payment in a form that is customary at its place of 
business. 
Art. 6.1.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
196 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, an importer in Luxembourg, receives a bill for goods bought 
from B, a firm in Central America, and sends a eurocheque in 
payment. B may reject this mode of payment if the banks in its 
country are not familiar with eurocheques. 
2. Presumption that payment will be honoured a condition for 
acceptance 
Paragraph (2) states the generally recognised principle according to 
which the obligee’s acceptance of an instrument that has to be honoured 
by a financial institution or another person (a third person or the obligor 
itself) is given only on condition that the instrument will actually be 
honoured. 
The presumption can sometimes be overturned by usages. There are 
for instance countries where delivery of instruments such as certified 
cheques, banker’s drafts and cashier’s cheques is considered as being 
equivalent to payment by the obligor, with the consequence that the risk 
of the bank’s insolvency is transferred to the obligee. In such countries, 
the rule in Article 6.1.7(2) would apply only to so-called personal 
cheques. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A, a contractor, must pay B, a sub-contractor, for work 
completed by the latter on a building site. A is experiencing a cash-
flow crisis as its client C is late in paying the first instalment due. C 
has however given A a set of promissory notes up to the amount of 
its debt. A offers to pay B by assigning a sufficient number of 
promissory notes. If B accepts them (in this case it probably does not 
have to do so as this is not a usual form of payment), the 
effectiveness of the payment by A to B is conditional on C’s 
honouring the promissory notes at maturity. 
ARTICLE  6.1.8 
(Payment by funds transfer) 
(1) Unless the obligee has indicated a 
particular account, payment may be made by a 
transfer to any of the financial institutions in 
which the obligee has made it known that it has 
an account. 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.8 
 
197 
(2) In case of payment by a transfer the 
obligation of the obligor is discharged when the 
transfer to the obligee’s financial institution 
becomes effective. 
COMMENT 
1. Admissibility of funds transfers 
Although the principle enunciated in Article 6.1.6 that payment of a 
monetary obligation should be made at the obligee’s place of business 
still stands, paragraph (1) of this Article provides that it can also be 
made to one of the financial institutions in which the obligee has made it 
known that it keeps an account. If however the obligee has indicated a 
particular account, payment should then be made to that account. 
Naturally, the obligee can also make it known that it does not wish 
payment to be made by transfer. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a shipyard established in country X, repairs a ship belonging 
to B, a company from country Y, and the bill is sent on a letter-head 
that mentions a bank account in country X and another in country Y. 
Unless A states that payment has to be made to the account in 
country X, or by a means other than a bank transfer, B is entitled to 
make payment to the account in country Y. 
2. Time at which the obligor’s obligation is discharged by a funds 
transfer 
Paragraph (2) of this Article deals with the difficult question of 
determining when a payment by funds transfer is to be considered as 
completed, i.e. when the obligor’s obligation is discharged. This matter 
is of importance, for example when deciding whether a payment was 
made in time, or in the event of one of the banks not forwarding the 
funds it has received. The choice of a satisfactory solution has been the 
centre of considerable controversy in many countries and international 
fora. Various possible times have been suggested, such as that of the 
debiting of the account of the transferor, the crediting to the account of 
the transferee bank, the notice of credit to that account, the decision of 
the transferee bank to accept a credit transfer, the entry of credit to the 
transferee’s account, the notice of credit to the transferee, etc. The 
matter is further complicated by the changes in the procedures for the 
transfer of funds entailed by new electronic transfer mechanisms,
Art. 6.1.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
198 
while bank practices may also differ from one case to another. 
This uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to establish a definite 
rule providing when payment by a transfer is completed. Paragraph (2) 
of this Article nevertheless serves a useful purpose in that it states the 
basic principle which will permit the finding of a more precise rule in 
each case. Such a payment will be effective when the transfer to the 
obligee’s financial institution becomes effective, a solution founded on 
the notion that the institution acts as the obligee’s agent. This means that 
the payment will not be effective simply because an order has been 
given to the transferor’s financial institution, and the transferor’s 
account has been debited. However, payment is effective before the 
transferee is notified or credited with it by its financial institution, 
although the precise moment at which payment to the obligee’s financial 
institution can be considered as being effective will depend on banking 
practices in the case concerned.

bankrupt. A has not effectively paid B. 
ARTICLE  6.1.9 
(Currency of payment) 
(1) If a monetary obligation is expressed in 
a currency other than that of the place for 
payment, it may be paid by the obligor in the 
currency of the place for payment unless 
(a) that currency is not freely convertible; 
or 
(b) the parties have agreed that payment 
should be made only in the currency in which the 
monetary obligation is expressed. 
(2) If it is impossible for the obligor to 
make payment in the currency in which the 
monetary obligation is expressed, the obligee may 
require payment in the currency of the place for 
payment, even in the case referred to in 
paragraph (1)(b). 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.9

(3) Payment in the currency of the place 
for payment is to be made according to the 
applicable rate of exchange prevailing there when 
payment is due. 
(4) However, if the obligor has not paid at 
the time when payment is due, the obligee may 
require payment according to the applicable rate 
of exchange prevailing either when payment is 
due or at the time of actual payment. 
COMMENT 
Monetary obligations are usually expressed in a certain currency 
(currency of account), and payment must normally be made in the same 
currency. However, when the currency of the place for payment is 
different from the currency of account, paragraphs (1) and (2) of this 
Article provide for those cases where the obligor may or must make 
payment in the former currency. 
1. Monetary obligation expressed in currency different from that of 
place for payment 
As a general rule, the obligor is given the alternative of paying in the 
currency of the place for payment, which may have definite practical 
advantages and, if that currency is freely convertible, this should cause 
no difficulty to the obligee. 
If, however, the currency of the place for payment is not freely 
convertible, the rule does not apply. Parties may also exclude the 
application of the rule by agreeing that payment is to be made only in 
the currency in which the monetary obligation is expressed (effectivo 
clause). If it has an interest in the payment actually being made in the 
currency of account, the obligee should specify this in the contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A company from country X receives an order for machinery 
from a buyer from country Y, the price being expressed in US 
dollars. According to Article 6.1.6, payment of that monetary 
obligation must in principle be made at the obligee’s place of 
business, i.e. country X. If the company from country Y finds it more 
convenient, it may pay the price in euro which is the currency of X 
(see Article 6.1.9(1)). 
2. 
The same company from country X frequently needs to buy 
from suppliers in country Z certain parts to be included in the 
machines, and has stipulated that the buyer from country Y should 
Art. 6.1.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
200 
pay only in US dollars. In this case, payment may only be made in 
dollars (see Article 6.1.9(1)(b)). 
3. 
The same company from country X has a plant in country W, 
where the machines will be assembled. The contract provides that 
the buyer from country Y has to pay the price to the firm’s 
subsidiary in country W. Since the currency of country W is not 
convertible, payment may only be made in dollars (see Article 
6.1.9(1)(a)). 
2. Impossibility for obligor to make payment in currency in which 
obligation is expressed 
In some instances, the obligor may find it impossible to make 
payment in the currency in which the obligation was expressed. This 
may be the result of the application of exchange regulations or other 
mandatory rules, or due to any other cause preventing the obligor from 
obtaining that currency in sufficient quantity. Paragraph (2) gives the 
obligee the option of requiring payment in the currency of the place for 
payment, even if the contract contains an effectivo clause. This is an 
additional option open to the obligee who may find it acceptable or even 
advantageous in the circumstances. It does not preclude the exercise of 
any available remedy in the event of the obligor’s inability to pay in the 
currency of account amounting to a non-performance of the contract 
(e.g. damages).

A, a Swiss bank, lends USD 1,000,000 to B, to be reimbursed 
in Geneva. At maturity, B is unable to find the necessary US dollars. 
A, which knows that B has deposits in Swiss francs with another 
local bank, may require payment in Swiss francs, even though the 
loan agreement stipulated that reimbursement was to be made only in 
US dollars (see Article 6.1.9(2)). 
3. Determination of applicable rate of exchange 
Paragraphs (3) and (4) deal with the problem of the determination of 
the rate of exchange to be chosen when payment is made in the currency 
of the place for payment rather than in a different currency stipulated in 
the contract. This may occur when the obligor avails itself of paragraph 
(1), or the obligee the provisions of paragraph (2). 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.10 
 
201 
Two widely accepted solutions are offered. In normal cases, the rate 
of exchange is that prevailing when payment is due. If, however, the 
obligor is in default, the obligee is given an option between the rate of 
exchange prevailing when payment was due or the rate at the time of 
actual payment. 
The double reference to the “applicable” rate is justified by the fact 
that there may be different rates of exchange depending on the nature of 
the operation.

The facts are the same as in Illustration 4. A chooses to be 
reimbursed in Swiss francs (CHF) and payment, which was due on 10 
April, actually takes place on 15 September. The rate of exchange on 
10 April was 2 Swiss francs to 1 US dollar. By 15 September it has 
become CHF 2,15 to USD 1. A is entitled to apply the latter rate. If the 
US dollar had depreciated rather than increased in value, A would 
have chosen the rate applicable on 10 April. 
ARTICLE  6.1.10 
(Currency not expressed) 
Where a monetary obligation is not 
expressed in a particular currency, payment must 
be made in the currency of the place where 
payment is to be made. 
COMMENT 
Determining the currency of payment gives rise to a special problem 
if the contract does not state the currency in which a monetary 
obligation is due. Although such cases may be infrequent, they do exist; 
a contract may for example state that the price will be the “current 
price”, or that it will be determined by a third person, or that some 
expenses or costs will be reimbursed by one party to the other, without 
specifying in which currency those sums are due. The rule laid down in 
Article 6.1.10 is that in such situations payment must be made in the 
currency of the place where payment is to be made. 
Article 6.1.10 is not concerned with the currency in which damages 
are to be assessed, a matter dealt with in Article 7.4.12 in the context of 
non-performance.

A, a Japanese client, instructs its broker, B, to buy shares on the 
Shanghai stock exchange. If B pays for them in Chinese Yuan 
Renminbi (CNY), should A be billed in Yuan Renminbi or in 
Japanese Yen? If A is to pay B in Japan, it will pay in Yen. 
ARTICLE  6.1.11 
(Costs of performance) 
Each party shall bear the costs of 
performance of its obligations. 
COMMENT 
The performance of obligations often entails costs, which may be of 
different kinds: transportation costs in delivering goods, bank 
commission in making a monetary transfer, fees to be paid when 
applying for a permission, etc. In principle, such costs are to be borne by 
the performing party. 
Other arrangements may of course be made by the parties and there 
is nothing to prevent the performing party from including those costs in 
advance in the price it quotes. The rule set out in Article 6.1.11 applies 
in the absence of such arrangements. 
The provision states who shall bear the costs, not who shall pay 
them. Usually, it will be the same party, but there may be different 
situations, for example where tax regulations place the burden of 
payment on a specific party. In such cases, if the person who has to pay 
is different from the person who must bear the costs under Article 
6.1.11, the latter must reimburse the former. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, a consultant, agrees to send five experts to perform an audit of

ARTICLE  6.1.12 
(Imputation of payments) 
(1) An obligor owing several monetary 
obligations to the same obligee may specify at the 
time of payment the debt to which it intends the 
payment to be applied. However, the payment 
discharges first any expenses, then interest due 
and finally the principal. 
(2) If the obligor makes no such specif-
ication, the obligee may, within a reasonable time 
after payment, declare to the obligor the obligation 
to which it imputes the payment, provided that the 
obligation is due and undisputed. 
(3) In the absence of imputation under 
paragraphs (1) or (2), payment is imputed to that 
obligation which satisfies one of the following 
criteria in the order indicated: 
(a) an obligation which is due or which is 
the first to fall due; 
(b) the obligation for which the obligee has 
least security; 
(c) the obligation which is the most 
burdensome for the obligor; 
(d) the obligation which has arisen first. 
If none of the preceding criteria applies, payment 
is imputed to all the obligations proportionally. 
COMMENT 
Articles 6.1.12 and 6.1.13 deal with the problem of imputation of 
payments. If an obligor owes several monetary obligations at the same 
time to the same obligee and makes a payment the amount of which is 
not sufficient to discharge all those debts, the question arises of the 
debts to which that payment applies. 
Article 6.1.12 offers the obligor the possibility of imputing its 
payment to a particular debt, provided that any expenses and interest 
due are discharged before the principal. In the absence of any 
imputation by the obligor, this provision enables the obligee to impute 
the payment received, although not to a disputed debt. Paragraph (3) 
lays down criteria which will govern in the absence of any imputation 
by either party.

A receives under separate contracts three loans, each of USD 
100,000, from bank B payment of which is due on 31 December. B 
receives USD 100,000 from A on 2 January with the imprecise 
message: “Reimbursement of the loan”. B pays little attention to the 
matter and at first does not react, but three months later sues A for 
payment of the remaining USD 200,000 and the parties disagree as 
to which of the loans had been reimbursed by the January payment. 
B had similar security in each case, but the interest rates were not the 
same: 8% on the first loan, 8,50% on the second and 9% on the third. 
The January payment will be imputed to the third loan. 
ARTICLE  6.1.13 
(Imputation of non-monetary obligations) 
Article 6.1.12 applies with appropriate 
adaptations to the imputation of performance of 
non-monetary obligations. 
COMMENT 
The problem of imputation of payments normally concerns monetary 
obligations, but similar difficulties may sometimes occur in relation to 
obligations of a different nature. Article 6.1.13 provides that the rules 
governing monetary obligations will apply, with appropriate adaptations 
also to these cases.

country and, through five separate and successive contracts with B, 
purchases different quantities of cement, all to be delivered in 
Antwerp on the same date and to be loaded on the same ship. The 
contracts are similar, except that the third and fifth contracts stipulate 
very high liquidated damages in the event of late delivery. On 
account of certain difficulties, B can only deliver part of what it was 
supposed to. Upon delivery B is entitled to specify that the quantities 
delivered are to be imputed to the third and fifth contracts.

ARTICLE  6.1.14 
(Application for public permission) 
Where the law of a State requires a public 
permission affecting the validity of the contract or 
its performance and neither that law nor the 
circumstances indicate otherwise 
(a) if only one party has its place of business 
in that State, that party shall take the measures 
necessary to obtain the permission; 
(b) in any other case the party whose 
performance requires permission shall take the 
necessary measures. 
COMMENT 
If the validity or the performance of a contract is subject to 
compliance with public permission requirements, several issues arise as 
to who has the burden of filing the application (see Article 6.1.14), the 
time for filing (see Article 6.1.15), the legal consequences of failure to 
obtain an administrative decision in due time (see Article 6.1.16) and 
the rejection of the application (see Article 6.1.17). 
1. Scope of the permission requirement 
The Principles do not deal with the relevance of public permission 
requirements. What kind of public permission is required, if any, is to be 
determined under the applicable law, including the rules of private 
international law. 
Courts tend to give effect only to the public permission requirements 
of the lex fori, and sometimes to those prescribed by the lex contractus. 
Arbitral tribunals may enjoy wider discretion than courts in deciding 
which public permissions are relevant to the contract. 
Under the relevant conflict of laws rules public permission 
requirements of the law of other jurisdictions connected with the 
contract may also come into play (see Article 9(3) of EC Regulation No. 
593/2008 (Rome I); Article 11(2) of the 1994 Inter-American 
Convention on the Law Applicable to International Contracts). Long-
arm statutes in some jurisdictions too may impose public permission 
requirements on licensees or subsidiaries of companies located abroad. 
This Article assumes that the requirements prescribed by the applicable 
law are to be observed. 
Art. 6.1.14 
UNIDROIT Principles 
206 
a. Broad notion of “public permission” 
The term “public permission” is to be given a broad interpretation. It 
includes all permission requirements established pursuant to a concern 
of a public nature, such as health, safety, or particular trade policies. It is 
irrelevant whether a required licence or permit is to be granted by a 
governmental or by a non-governmental institution to which 
Governments have delegated public authority for a specific purpose. 
Thus, the authorisation of payments by a private bank pursuant to 
foreign exchange regulations is in the nature of a “public permission” 
for the purposes of this Article. 
b. Timing of public permission 
The provisions on public permissions refer primarily to those 
required by the applicable law or by a regulation in force at the time of 
the conclusion of the contract. However, these provisions may also 
apply to public permissions that may be introduced after the conclusion 
of the contract.  
c. Public permission may affect the contract in whole or in part 
The provisions on public permissions apply both to those 
requirements affecting the contract as a whole and to those merely 
affecting individual terms of the contract. However, where the legal 
consequences of failing to obtain a public permission differ according to 
whether such permission affects the contract in whole or in part, 
different rules are established (see Articles 6.1.16(2) and 6.1.17). 
d. Public permission may affect the validity or performance of a 
contract 
The absence of the required permission may affect the validity of a 
contract or render its performance impossible. Notwithstanding 
differences in the legal consequences of failing to obtain a required 
public permission, the problems raised in connection with the 
application for, or the obtaining of, a public permission are the same. As 
to the further consequences, Article 6.1.17(2) provides that the rules on 
non-performance apply to a situation where the refusal of a permission 
makes the performance of a contract impossible in whole or in part. 
2. Duty to inform of the existence of a public permission 
requirement 
There is as a rule no duty to provide information concerning the 
requirement to obtain a public permission. However, the existence of 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.14 
 
207 
such a requirement must be disclosed by the party upon whom rests the 
burden of obtaining a public permission when such permission is 
required under rules which are not generally accessible. Thus, the 
overriding principle of good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7) may 
require the party whose place of business is located in the State 
requiring a public permission to inform the other party of the existence 
of that requirement. Failure to do so may lead a court to disregard the 
permission requirement altogether or to conclude that the party who 
failed to communicate the existence of the requirement implicitly 
guaranteed that it would be obtained. 
3. Which party is bound to take measures to obtain a public 
permission 
a. Party with place of business in State requiring public permission 
The rule set out in sub-paragraph (a) of this Article which places the 
burden to apply on the party who has its place of business in the State 
which requires the relevant public permission reflects current 
international trade practices. It is that party who is in the best position to 
apply promptly for a public permission, since it is probably more 
familiar with the application requirements and procedures.  
If a party needs further information from the other to file an 
application (e.g. information relating to the final destination of the 
goods, or information as to the purpose or subject matter of the 
contract), the other party must furnish such information pursuant to the 
duty of co-operation (see Article 5.1.3). Should that party not furnish 
such information it may not rely on the obligation of the first party. This 
duty to cooperate with the other party applies even if the contract 
stipulates that one of the parties bears the burden of applying for a 
public permission. Thus, if the parties have incorporated in their 
contract the term “ex works”, which imposes far-reaching obligations on 
the buyer, the seller is nevertheless bound to “render the buyer, at the 
latter’s request, risk and expense, every assistance in obtaining […] any 
export licence or other official authorisation necessary for the export of 
the goods” (INCOTERMS 2010, A 2, see also B 2).  
b. Party whose performance requires public permission 
Sub-paragraph (b) of this Article contemplates those cases where 
none of the parties has a place of business in the State requiring the 
permission. It also envisions a contract which is truly international 
notwithstanding the fact that both parties have their places of business in 
that State. In either case, the party whose performance requires the 
Art. 6.1.14 
UNIDROIT Principles 
208 
public permission is bound to take the necessary measures to obtain 
such a permission. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a contractor whose place of business is located in country X, 
sells a plant on a turn-key basis to B, whose place of business is 
located in country Y. Acceptance is to take place after performance 
tests in country Y. On the one hand, A has to apply for all public 
permissions required in country X, as well as for permissions in third 
countries (transit, sub-deliveries). On the other, B has to apply for 
import licences, as well as for all other permissions relating to the 
site, the use of local services, and the technology imported into 
country Y. A is also bound to furnish the information and 
documentation needed by B to obtain import licences and other 
permissions related to B’s performance. A is not responsible for 
applying for public permissions in country Y, unless this is agreed in 
the contract or is required, explicitly or implicitly, by the applicable 
law or the circumstances of the case (e.g. the applicable law may 
require certain technical permits in country Y to be applied for by the 
licensor). 
c. Suppletory nature of provisions on public permissions 
The purpose of this Article is to determine the party who must apply 
for a public permission in those cases where it is not clear who is to bear 
that burden. It is a suppletory rule to be applied when neither the 
contract, nor the law requiring the permission or the circumstances 
specify which party is under an obligation to apply for the required 
public permission. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The law of country X subordinates the granting of an export 
licence for computers to a sworn declaration indicating the country 
where the computers will ultimately be sent. However, neither the 
contract nor the law of country X indicates which party bears the 
burden of applying for a licence. Since it is reasonable to suppose 
that only the buyer knows what it plans to do with the computers, the 
policy behind the rule imposing the permission requirement leads to 
the conclusion that it is the buyer who has to file the application. 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.15 
 
209 
4. Nature of obligation to take the “necessary measures” 
The party who has to apply for the permission must take the 
“necessary measures” to obtain such permission, but is not responsible 
for the outcome of the application. That party is bound to exhaust 
available local remedies to obtain the permission, provided that they 
have a good chance of success and that resorting to local remedies 
appears reasonable in view of the circumstances of the case (e.g. the 
value of the transaction, time constraints). 
Which measures have to be taken depends on the relevant regulations 
and the procedural mechanisms available in the State where the 
permission is to be granted. The obligation is in the nature of an 
obligation of best efforts (see Article 5.1.4(2)). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
A, a principal whose place of business is in country X, enters 
into a contract with B, a self-employed agent, whose place of 
business is in country Y. B, who has no authority to conclude 
contracts, is to represent A in countries Y and Z. Among other 
duties, B must exhibit A’s goods at a fair which is to take place in 
country Z. B must apply for all permissions which are required to 
undertake these professional activities in countries Y and Z. B’s duty 
to take “necessary measures” includes that of applying for public 
permissions required to import A’s goods temporarily into countries 
Y and Z, as well as any other public permission that would enable B 
to participate in the fair. However, unless otherwise agreed, B is not 
required to apply for public permissions required for goods imported 
through B by customers located in countries Y and Z. 
ARTICLE  6.1.15 
(Procedure in applying for permission) 
(1) The party required to take the 
measures necessary to obtain the permission shall 
do so without undue delay and shall bear any 
expenses incurred. 
(2) That party shall whenever appropriate 
give the other party notice of the grant or refusal 
of such permission without undue delay. 
Art. 6.1.15 
UNIDROIT Principles 
210 
COMMENT 
1. Time for filing an application 
The party under an obligation to obtain a public permission must 
take action immediately after the conclusion of the contract and pursue 
this action as necessary under the circumstances. 
2. Expenses 
According to Article 6.1.11, each party shall bear the costs of 
performance of its obligations. This rule has been restated in paragraph 
(1) of this Article for the sake of clarity. 
3. Duty to give prompt notice of the grant or refusal of the 
permission 
The parties to the contract need to know as soon as possible whether 
the permission can be obtained. Accordingly, paragraph (2) of this 
Article provides that the party required to take the necessary measures 
must inform the other of the outcome of the application. This duty of 
information extends to other relevant facts, such as for example the 
timing and outcome of the application, whether a refusal is subject to 
appeal and whether an appeal is to be lodged. 
4. Duty to give notice “whenever appropriate” 
The “appropriateness” of giving notice of the grant or refusal refers 
to the need to give notice and the manner of providing it. The necessity 
of giving notice obviously exists where such notice is required by law, 
but may also be inferred from the mere fact that a permission 
requirement is referred to in the contract. 
The “appropriateness” of the duty to give notice is also related to the 
relevance of the information to be provided. Accordingly, the applying 
party is not bound to inform the other party of the outcome of that 
application in cases where the latter party obtains the information from 
the granting authority, or where applications for permissions are 
regularly granted. The fact that the permission is, contrary to normal 
practice, refused in a given case makes the obligation to inform more 
compelling. 
This Article does not establish particular requirements concerning 
the formalities relating to the communication (see Article 1.10). 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.15 
 
211 
5. Consequences of the failure to inform 
Failure to provide information regarding the grant or refusal of the 
permission amounts to non-performance. Accordingly, the general 
consequences of non-performance, as set forth in Chapter 7, apply. The 
duty to give notice of the grant of the public permission is a contractual 
obligation arising at the time the contract comes into existence. The duty 
to give notice of the refusal of the permission is part of the duty to take 
the “necessary measures” to obtain the permission under Article 6.1.14 
(see Comment 4). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, whose place of business is in country X, and B, a contractor, 
enter into a contract for the construction of a plant in country X. The 
parties agree that B is not bound to begin the construction and A’s 
advance payments are not due until the grant of a permission by the 
authorities of country X. 
A applies for and obtains the permission but fails to inform B 
that the permission has been granted. Two months later, B learns 
through inquiries with the authorities of country X that the 
permission has been granted and begins work on the construction of 
the plant. 
Although the parties had agreed that their performances were 
due as of the time of the granting of the permission, A’s failure to 
inform B that the permission has been granted precludes A from 
relying on B’s failure to perform as of that date (see Article 7.1.2). 
Thus, the contractual period begins to run for B as from when it 
learns of the granting of the permission. 
Moreover, B may also claim damages if it is able to establish, 
for example, damage resulting from failure to use its production 
capacity, additional costs arising from storing raw materials during 
that two-month period, etc. (see Article 7.4.1 et seq.). A, who from 
the very beginning had notice of the grant of the permission, must 
observe the original date of its performance, as provided for in the 
contract. If A fails to make an advance payment due four weeks after 
the granting of the permission, A must pay interest as from that date.  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the proper 
authority simultaneously informs A and B that the permission has 
been granted. B may not avail itself of A’s failure to inform in order 
to postpone its performance, nor is it entitled to damages for A’s 
failure to inform. 
 
Art. 6.1.16 
UNIDROIT Principles 
212 
ARTICLE  6.1.16 
(Permission neither granted nor refused) 
(1) If, notwithstanding the fact that the 
party responsible has taken all measures re-
quired, permission is neither granted nor refused 
within an agreed period or, where no period has 
been agreed, within a reasonable time from the 
conclusion of the contract, either party is entitled 
to terminate the contract. 
(2) Where the permission affects some 
terms only, paragraph (1) does not apply if, 
having regard to the circumstances, it is reason-
able to uphold the remaining contract even if the 
permission is refused. 
COMMENT 
Whereas Articles 6.1.14 and 6.1.15 are concerned with the duties of 
the contracting parties, Articles 6.1.16 and 6.1.17 deal with the legal 
consequences in cases respectively where there has been no decision on 
the application within a given period or where the public permission has 
been refused. 
1. No decision taken as regards the permission 
Paragraph (1) of this Article deals with the “nothing happens” 
situation, that is to say a situation where permission has neither been 
granted nor refused within the agreed period or, where no period has 
been agreed, within a reasonable time from the conclusion of the 
contract. The reasons for the absence of a pronouncement may vary, for 
example the slow pace of processing the application, a pending appeal, 
etc. In any event there is no longer any reason to keep the parties 
waiting and either party is entitled to terminate the contract. 
2. Termination of the contract 
Remedies other than termination may be appropriate depending on 
the legal role played by the permission in the creation of the contractual 
obligations.  This  is  in  particular  the  case  where  the  granting  of the 
 
Performance in General 
Art. 6.1.16 
 
213 
public permission is a condition for the validity of the contract, since in 
the absence of the permission either party may simply disregard the 
contract. The reason why this Article provides also in these cases for the 
termination of the contract is that the parties are, with a view to 
obtaining the permission, under a number of obligations which cannot 
be allowed to exist indefinitely. 
The entitlement of the party responsible for obtaining the permission 
to terminate the contract under this Article is conditional on that party’s 
having taken “the necessary measures” to that effect. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, situated in country X, sells rifles to B for resale by B in the 
hunting season starting in four months. The validity of the sale is 
subject to a public permission to be granted by the authorities of 
country X. No period is agreed for obtaining that permission. 
Notwithstanding the fact that A takes all the necessary measures to 
obtain the permission, after three months no decision has yet been 
taken on A’s application. Either party may terminate the contract. 
The termination envisaged under this Article has no consequences 
for the expenses so far incurred by the parties for the purpose of 
obtaining the permission. The expenses will be borne by the party who 
has assumed the risk of not obtaining the permission. 
3. Permission affecting individual terms only 
Where the permission affects some terms only of the contract, 
paragraph (2) of this Article excludes the right of termination in cases 
where, even if the permission had been refused, it would according to 
Article 6.1.17(1) nevertheless be reasonable to uphold the contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A, situated in country X, enters into a contract with B, which 
contains a penalty clause for delay the validity of which is subject to 
a public permission to be granted by the authorities of country X. 
Notwithstanding the fact that A takes all the necessary measures to 
obtain the permission, time continues to pass without any decision 
being taken. It would be reasonable in the circumstances to uphold 
the contract. Even if the permission were to have been refused, 
neither party may terminate the contract. 
Art. 6.1.17 
UNIDROIT Principles 
214 
ARTICLE  6.1.17 
(Permission refused) 
(1) The refusal of a permission affecting 
the validity of the contract renders the contract 
void. If the refusal affects the validity of some 
terms only, only such terms are void if, having 
regard to the circumstances, it is reasonable to 
uphold the remaining contract. 
(2) Where the refusal of a permission 
renders 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
contract 
impossible in whole or in part, the rules on non-
performance apply. 
COMMENT 
1. Application for permission rejected 
This Article contemplates the situation where the application for a 
permission is expressly refused. The nature of the obligation imposed on 
the responsible party with respect to the application for the permission is 
such that a refusal under this Article is one which is not subject to an 
appeal which has a reasonable prospect of success (see Comment 4 on 
Article 6.1.14). Moreover, means of recourse against the refusal need 
not be exhausted whenever a final decision on the permission would be 
taken only after the time at which the contract could meaningfully be 
performed. 
2. Legal consequences of a refusal of permission 
The consequences of a refusal to grant the permission vary 
depending on whether the permission affects the validity of the contract 
or its performance.  
a. Refusal of permission affecting validity of the contract 
Where the permission affects the validity of the whole contract, a 
refusal renders the whole contract void, i.e. the contract is considered as 
never having come into being.

A, situated in country X, enters into a contract with B, the 
validity of which is subject to a public permission to be granted by 
the authorities of country X. Notwithstanding the fact that A takes all 
the necessary measures to obtain the permission, A’s application is 
refused. The contract is considered never to have come into 
existence. 
Where, on the other hand, a refusal affects the validity of some terms 
only of the contract, only such terms are void, while the remaining part 
of the contract may be upheld provided that such a result is reasonable 
in the circumstances. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A, situated in country X, enters into a contract with B, which 
contains a penalty clause for delay the validity of which is subject to 
a public permission to be granted by the authorities of country X. 
Notwithstanding the fact that A takes all the necessary measures to 
obtain the permission, A’s application is refused. If it is reasonable 
in the circumstances, the contract will be upheld without the penalty 
clause. 
b. Refusal rendering performance of the contract impossible 
If the refusal of the permission renders the performance impossible 
in whole or in part, paragraph (2) of this Article refers to the rules on 
non-performance embodied in Chapter 7.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Under a contract entered into with B, A owes B USD 100,000. 
The transfer of the sum from country X, where A is situated, to B’s 
bank account in country Y is subject to a permission by the Central 
Bank of country X. Notwithstanding the fact that A takes all the 
necessary measures to obtain the permission, A’s application is 
refused. The refusal of the permission renders it impossible for A to 
pay B. The consequences of A’s non-performance are determined in 
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 7. 
The refusal of the permission may render the performance of a party 
impossible only in the State imposing the permission requirement, while 
it may be possible for that party to perform the same obligation 
elsewhere. In such cases the general principle of good faith and fair 
dealing (see Article 1.7) will prevent that party from relying on the 
refusal of the permission as an excuse for non-performance.

I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, except that A has 
sufficient funds to pay B in country Z, where no such permission 
requirement exists. A may not rely on the refusal of the permission 
by the authorities of country X as an excuse for not paying B.

SECTION  2: HARDSHIP 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  6.2.1 
(Contract to be observed) 
Where the performance of a contract 
becomes more onerous for one of the parties, that 
party is nevertheless bound to perform its 
obligations subject to the following provisions on 
hardship. 
COMMENT 
1. Binding character of the contract the general rule 
The purpose of this Article is to make it clear that as a consequence 
of the general principle of the binding character of the contract (see 
Article 1.3) performance must be rendered as long as it is possible and 
regardless of the burden it may impose on the performing party. In other 
words, even if a party experiences heavy losses instead of the expected 
profits or the performance has become meaningless for that party the 
terms of the contract must nevertheless be respected.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, a forwarding agent, enters into a two-year shipping contract with 
B, a carrier. Under the contract B is bound to ship certain goods from 
country X to country Y at a fixed rate, on a monthly basis throughout 
the two-year period. Two years later, alleging a substantial increase 
in the price of fuel in the aftermath of a political crisis in the region, 
B requests a five per cent increase in the rate. B is not entitled to 
such an increase because B bears the risk of its performance 
becoming more onerous. 
2. Change in circumstances relevant only in exceptional cases  
The principle of the binding character of the contract is not however 
an absolute one. When supervening circumstances are such that they 
lead to a fundamental alteration of the equilibrium of the contract, they 
create an exceptional situation referred to in the Principles as “hardship” 
and dealt with in the following Articles of this Section.  
Art. 6.2.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
218 
The phenomenon of hardship has been acknowledged by various 
legal systems under the guise of other concepts such as frustration of 
purpose, Wegfall der Geschäftsgrundlage, imprévision, eccessiva 
onerosità sopravvenuta, etc. The term “hardship” was chosen because it 
is widely known in international trade practice as confirmed by the 
inclusion in many international contracts of so-called “hardship 
clauses”. 
ARTICLE  6.2.2 
(Definition of hardship) 
There is hardship where the occurrence of 
events fundamentally alters the equilibrium of the 
contract either because the cost of a party’s 
performance has increased or because the value of 
the performance a party receives has diminished, 
and 
(a) the events occur or become known to 
the disadvantaged party after the conclusion of the 
contract; 
(b) the events could not reasonably have 
been taken into account by the disadvantaged 
party at the time of the conclusion of the contract; 
(c) the events are beyond the control of the 
disadvantaged party; and 
(d) the risk of the events was not assumed 
by the disadvantaged party. 
COMMENT 
1. Hardship defined 
This Article defines hardship as a situation where the occurrence of 
events fundamentally alters the equilibrium of the contract, provided 
that those events meet the requirements which are laid down in sub-
paragraphs (a) to (d). 
2. Fundamental alteration of equilibrium of the contract 
Since the general principle is that a change in circumstances does not 
affect the obligation to perform (see Article 6.2.1), it follows that 
 
Hardship 
Art. 6.2.2 
 
219 
hardship may not be invoked unless the alteration of the equilibrium of 
the contract is fundamental. Whether an alteration is “fundamental” in a 
given case will of course depend upon the circumstances.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
In September 1989 A, a dealer in electronic goods situated in 
the former German Democratic Republic, purchases stocks from B, 
situated in country X, also a former socialist country. The goods are 
to be delivered by B in December 1990. In November 1990, A 
informs B that the goods are no longer of any use to it, claiming that 
after the unification of the German Democratic Republic and the 
Federal Republic of Germany and the opening of the former German 
Democratic Republic to the international market there is no longer 
any market for such goods imported from country X. Unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise, A is entitled to invoke hardship. 
a. Increase in cost of performance 
In practice a fundamental alteration in the equilibrium of the contract 
may manifest itself in two different but related ways. The first is 
characterised by a substantial increase in the cost for one party of 
performing its obligation. This party will normally be the one who is to 
perform the non-monetary obligation. The substantial increase in the 
cost may, for instance, be due to a dramatic rise in the price of the raw 
materials necessary for the production of the goods or the rendering of 
the services, or to the introduction of new safety regulations requiring 
far more expensive production procedures.  
b. Decrease in value of the performance received by one party 
The second manifestation of hardship is characterised by a 
substantial decrease in the value of the performance received by one 
party, including cases where the performance no longer has any value at 
all for the receiving party. The performance may relate either to a 
monetary or a non-monetary obligation. The substantial decrease in the 
value or the total loss of any value of the performance may be due either 
to drastic changes in market conditions (e.g. the effect of a dramatic 
increase in inflation on a contractually agreed price) or the frustration of 
the purpose for which the performance was required (e.g. the effect of a 
prohibition to build on a plot of land acquired for building purposes or 
the effect of an export embargo on goods acquired with a view to their 
subsequent export).  
Naturally the decrease in value of the performance must be capable 
of objective measurement: a mere change in the personal opinion of the 
receiving party as to the value of the performance is of no relevance. As 
Art. 6.2.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
220 
to the frustration of the purpose of the performance, this can only be 
taken into account when the purpose in question was known or at least 
ought to have been known to both parties. 
3. Additional requirements for hardship to arise 
a. Events occur or become known after conclusion of the contract 
According to sub-paragraph (a) of this Article, the events causing 
hardship must take place or become known to the disadvantaged party 
after the conclusion of the contract. If that party had known of those 
events when entering into the contract, it would have been able to take 
them into account at that time. In such a case that party may not 
subsequently rely on hardship.  
b. Events could not reasonably have been taken into account by 
disadvantaged party 
Even if the change in circumstances occurs after the conclusion of 
the contract, sub-paragraph (b) of this Article makes it clear that such 
circumstances cannot cause hardship if they could reasonably have been 
taken into account by the disadvantaged party at the time the contract 
was concluded.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A agrees to supply B with crude oil from country X at a fixed 
price for the next five years, notwithstanding the acute political 
tensions in the region. Two years after the conclusion of the contract, 
a war erupts between contending factions in neighbouring countries. 
The war results in a world energy crisis and oil prices increase 
drastically. A is not entitled to invoke hardship because such a rise in 
the price of crude oil was not unforeseeable.  
Sometimes the change in circumstances is gradual, but the final 
result of those gradual changes may constitute a case of hardship. If the 
change began before the contract was concluded, hardship will not arise 
unless the pace of change increases dramatically during the life of the 
contract.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
In a sales contract between A and B the price is expressed in 
the currency of country X, a currency the value of which was already 
depreciating slowly against other major currencies before the 
conclusion of the contract. One month thereafter a political crisis in 
country X leads to a massive devaluation of its currency of the order 
 
Hardship 
Art. 6.2.2 
 
221 
of 80%. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, this constitutes 
a case of hardship, since such a dramatic acceleration of the loss of 
value of the currency of country X was not foreseeable. 
c.  Events beyond the control of disadvantaged party 
Under sub-paragraph (c) of this Article a case of hardship can only 
arise if the events causing the hardship are beyond the control of the 
disadvantaged party. 
d. Risks must not have been assumed by disadvantaged party 
Under sub-paragraph (d) there can be no hardship if the disadvan-
taged party had assumed the risk of the change in circumstances. The 
word “assumption” makes it clear that the risks need not have been 
taken over expressly, but that this may follow from the very nature of 
the contract. A party who enters into a speculative transaction is deemed 
to accept a certain degree of risk, even though it may not have been 
fully aware of that risk at the time it entered into the contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
A, an insurance company specialised in the insurance of 
shipping risks, requests an additional premium from those of its 
customers who have contracts which include the risks of war and 
civil insurrection, so as to meet the substantially greater risk to which 
it is exposed following upon the simultaneous outbreak of war and 
civil insurrection in three countries in the same region. A is not 
entitled to such an adaptation of the contract, since by the war and 
civil insurrection clauses insurance companies assume these risks 
even if three countries are affected at the same time. 
4. Hardship relevant only to performance not yet rendered  
By its very nature hardship can only become of relevance with 
respect to performances still to be rendered: once a party has performed, 
it is no longer entitled to invoke a substantial increase in the costs of its 
performance or a substantial decrease in the value of the performance it 
receives as a consequence of a change in circumstances which occurs 
after such performance.  
If the fundamental alteration in the equilibrium of the contract occurs 
at a time when performance has been only partially rendered, hardship 
can be of relevance only to the parts of the performance still to be 
rendered. 
Art. 6.2.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
222 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
A enters into a contract with B, a waste disposal company in 
country X, for the purpose of arranging the storage of its waste. The 
contract provides for a four-year term and a fixed price per ton of 
waste. Two years after the conclusion of the contract, the environ-
mental movement in country X gains ground and the Government of 
country X prescribes prices for storing waste which are ten times 
higher than before. B may successfully invoke hardship only with 
respect to the two remaining years of the life of the contract. 
5. Hardship normally relevant to long-term contracts 
Although this Article does not expressly exclude the possibility of 
hardship being invoked in respect of other kinds of contract, hardship will 
normally be of relevance to long-term contracts. 
6. Hardship and force majeure 
In view of the definitions of hardship in this Article and force 
majeure in Article 7.1.7, under the Principles there may be factual 
situations which can at the same time be considered as cases of hardship 
and of force majeure. If this is the case, it is for the party affected by 
these events to decide which remedy to pursue. If it invokes force 
majeure, it is with a view to its non-performance being excused. If, on 
the other hand, a party invokes hardship, this is in the first instance for 
the purpose of renegotiating the terms of the contract so as to allow the 
contract to be kept alive although on revised terms. 
7. Hardship and contract practice 
The definition of hardship in this Article is necessarily of a rather 
general character. International commercial contracts often contain 
much more precise and elaborate provisions in this regard. The parties 
may therefore find it appropriate to adapt the content of this Article so 
as to take account of the particular features of the specific transaction. 
 
Hardship 
Art. 6.2.3 
 
223 
ARTICLE  6.2.3 
(Effects of hardship) 
(1) In case of hardship the disadvantaged 
party is entitled to request renegotiations. The 
request shall be made without undue delay and 
shall indicate the grounds on which it is based. 
(2) The request for renegotiation does not 
in itself entitle the disadvantaged party to 
withhold performance. 
(3) Upon failure to reach agreement within 
a reasonable time either party may resort to the 
court. 
(4) If the court finds hardship it may, if 
reasonable, 
(a) terminate the contract at a date and on 
terms to be fixed, or 
(b) adapt the contract with a view to 
restoring its equilibrium. 
COMMENT 
1. Disadvantaged party entitled to request renegotiations 
Since hardship consists in a fundamental alteration of the equilibrium 
of the contract, paragraph (1) of this Article in the first instance entitles 
the disadvantaged party to request the other party to enter into 
renegotiation of the original terms of the contract with a view to 
adapting them to the changed circumstances.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a construction company situated in country X, enters into a 
lump sum contract with B, a governmental agency, for the erection 
of a plant in country Y. Most of the sophisticated machinery has to 
be imported from abroad. Due to an unexpected devaluation of the 
currency of country Y, which is the currency of payment, the cost of 
the machinery increases dramatically. A is entitled to request B to 
renegotiate the original contract price so as to adapt it to the changed 
circumstances. 
A request for renegotiations is not admissible where the contract 
itself already incorporates a clause providing for the automatic 
Art. 6.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
224 
adaptation of the contract (e.g. a clause providing for automatic 
indexation of the price if certain events occur).  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the 
contract contains a price indexation clause relating to variations in 
the cost of materials and labour. A is not entitled to request a 
renegotiation of the price. 
However, even in such a case renegotiation on account of hardship 
would not be precluded if the adaptation clause incorporated in the 
contract did not contemplate the events giving rise to hardship. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2, except that the 
substantial increase in A’s costs is due to the adoption of new safety 
regulations in country Y. A is entitled to request B to renegotiate the 
original contract price so as to adapt it to the changed circumstances. 
2. Request for renegotiations without undue delay 
The request for renegotiations must be made as quickly as possible 
after the time at which hardship is alleged to have occurred (paragraph 
(1)). The precise time for requesting renegotiations will depend upon the 
circumstances of the case: it may, for instance, be longer when the 
change in circumstances takes place gradually (see Comment 3(b) on 
Article 6.2.2). 
The disadvantaged party does not lose its right to request 
renegotiations simply because it fails to act without undue delay. The 
delay in making the request may however affect the finding as to 
whether hardship actually existed and, if so, its consequences for the 
contract. 
3. Grounds for request for renegotiations 
Paragraph (1) of this Article also imposes on the disadvantaged party 
a duty to indicate the grounds on which the request for renegotiations is 
based, so as to permit the other party better to assess whether or not the 
request for renegotiations is justified. An incomplete request is to be 
considered as not being raised in time, unless the grounds of the alleged 
hardship are so obvious that they need not be spelt out in the request. 
Failure to set forth the grounds on which the request for 
renegotiations is based may have similar effects to those resulting from 
undue delay in making the request (see Comment 2 on this Article). 
 
Hardship 
Art. 6.2.3 
 
225 
4. Request for renegotiations and withholding of performance 
Paragraph (2) of this Article provides that the request for renego-
tiations does not of itself entitle the disadvantaged party to withhold 
performance. The reason for this lies in the exceptional character of 
hardship and in the risk of possible abuses of the remedy. Withholding 
performance may be justified only in extraordinary circumstances. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
A enters into a contract with B for the construction of a plant. 
The plant is to be built in country X, which adopts new safety regu-
lations after the conclusion of the contract. The new regulations 
require additional apparatus and thereby fundamentally alter the 
equilibrium of the contract making A’s performance substantially 
more onerous. A is entitled to request renegotiations and may with-
hold performance in view of the time it needs to implement the new 
safety regulations, but it may also withhold the delivery of the 
additional apparatus, for as long as the corresponding price 
adaptation is not agreed. 
5. Renegotiations in good faith 
Although nothing is said in this Article to that effect, both the request 
for renegotiations by the disadvantaged party and the conduct of both 
parties during the renegotiation process are subject to the general principle 
of good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7) and to the duty of co-
operation (see Article 5.1.3). Thus the disadvantaged party must honestly 
believe that a case of hardship actually exists and not request 
renegotiations as a purely tactical manoeuvre. Similarly, once the request 
has been made, both parties must conduct the renegotiations in a 
constructive manner, in particular by refraining from any form of 
obstruction and by providing all the necessary information. 
6. Resort to the court upon failure to reach an agreement 
If the parties fail to reach agreement on the adaptation of the contract 
to the changed circumstances within a reasonable time, paragraph (3) of 
this Article authorises either party to resort to the court. Such a situation 
may arise either because the non-disadvantaged party completely 
ignored the request for renegotiations or because the renegotiations, 
although conducted by both parties in good faith, did not have a positive 
outcome.  
How long a party must wait before resorting to the court will depend 
on the complexity of the issues to be settled and the particular 
circumstances of the case. 
Art. 6.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
226 
7. Court measures in case of hardship 
According to paragraph (4) of this Article a court which finds that a 
hardship situation exists may react in a number of different ways. 
A first possibility is for it to terminate the contract. However, since 
termination in this case does not depend on non-performance by one of 
the parties, its effects on the performances already rendered might be 
different from those provided for by the rules governing termination in 
general (see Articles 7.3.1. et seq.). Accordingly, paragraph (4)(a) 
provides that termination shall take place “at a date and on terms to be 
fixed” by the court. 
Another possibility would be for a court to adapt the contract with a 
view to restoring its equilibrium (paragraph (4)(b)). In so doing the 
court will seek to make a fair distribution of the losses between the 
parties. This may or may not, depending on the nature of the hardship, 
involve a price adaptation. However, if it does, the adaptation will not 
necessarily reflect in full the loss entailed by the change in 
circumstances, since the court will, for instance, have to consider the 
extent to which one of the parties has taken a risk and the extent to 
which the party entitled to receive a performance may still benefit from 
that performance. 
Paragraph (4) of this Article expressly states that the court may 
terminate or adapt the contract only when this is reasonable. The 
circumstances may even be such that neither termination nor adaptation 
is appropriate and in consequence the only reasonable solution will be 
for the court either to direct the parties to resume negotiations with a 
view to reaching agreement on the adaptation of the contract, or to 
confirm the terms of the contract as they stand. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
A, an exporter, undertakes to supply B, an importer in country 
X, with beer for three years. Two years after the conclusion of the 
contract new legislation is introduced in country X prohibiting the 
sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks. B immediately invokes 
hardship and requests A to renegotiate the contract. A recognises that 
hardship has occurred, but refuses to accept the modifications of the 
contract proposed by B. After one month of fruitless discussions B 
resorts to the court. 
 
If B has the possibility to sell the beer in a neighbouring 
country, although at a substantially lower price, the court may decide 
to uphold the contract but to reduce the agreed price. 
 
If on the contrary B has no such possibility, it may be 
reasonable for the court to terminate the contract, at the same time 
however requiring B to pay A for the last consignment still en route. 
 
 
227 
CHAPTER  7 
 
 
 
NON-PERFORMANCE 
 
 
 
SECTION  1: NON-PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  7.1.1 
(Non-performance defined) 
Non-performance is failure by a party to 
perform any of its obligations under the contract, 
including 
defective 
performance 
or 
late 
performance. 
COMMENT 
This Article defines “non-performance” for the purpose of the 
Principles. Particular attention should be drawn to two features of the 
definition.  
The first is that “non-performance” is defined so as to include all 
forms of defective performance as well as complete failure to perform. 
Thus, it is non-performance for a builder to erect a building which is 
partly in accordance with the contract and partly defective or to 
complete the building late. 
The second feature is that for the purposes of the Principles the 
concept of “non-performance” includes both non-excused and excused 
non-performance. 
Non-performance may be excused by reason of the conduct of the 
other party to the contract (see Articles 7.1.2 (Interference by the other 
party) and 7.1.3 (Withholding performance) and Comments) or because 
of unexpected external events (see Article 7.1.7 (Force majeure) and 
Comment)). A party is not entitled to claim damages or specific 
performance for an excused non-performance of the other party but a 
party who has not received performance will as a rule be entitled to 
terminate the contract whether or not the non-performance is excused 
(see Article 7.3.1 et seq. and Comment). 
Art. 7.1.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
228 
There is no general provision dealing with cumulation of remedies. 
The assumption underlying the Principles is that all remedies which are 
not logically inconsistent may be cumulated. So, in general, a party who 
successfully insists on performance will not be entitled to damages but 
there is no reason why a party may not terminate a contract for non-
excused non-performance and simultaneously claim damages (see 
Articles 7.2.5 (Change of remedy), 7.3.5 (Effects of termination in 
general) and 7.4.1 (Right to damages)). 
ARTICLE  7.1.2 
(Interference by the other party) 
A party may not rely on the non-
performance of the other party to the extent that 
such non-performance was caused by the first 
party’s act or omission or by another event for 
which the first party bears the risk. 
COMMENT 
1. Non-performance caused by act or omission of the party alleging 
non-performance 
This Article can be regarded as providing two excuses for non-
performance. However conceptually, it goes further than this. When the 
Article applies, the relevant conduct does not become excused non-
performance but loses the quality of non-performance altogether. It 
follows, for instance, that the other party will not be able to terminate 
for non-performance. 
Two distinct situations are contemplated. In the first, one party is 
unable to perform either wholly or in part because the other party has 
done something which makes performance in whole or in part 
impossible. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A agrees to perform building work on B’s land beginning on 1 
February. If B locks the gate to the land and does not allow A entry, 
B cannot complain that A has failed to begin work. B’s conduct will 
often amount to non-excused non-performance either because of an 
express provision entitling A to access the land or because B’s 
conduct infringes the obligations of good faith and co-operation.
 
Non-performance in General 
Art. 7.1.3 
 
229 
This result does not however depend on B’s non-performance being 
non-excused. The result will be the same where B’s non-performance 
is excused, for instance because access to the land is barred by strikers. 
The Principles contemplate the possibility that one party’s inter-
ference result only in a partial impediment to performance by the other 
party. In such cases it will be necessary to decide the extent to which 
non-performance was caused by the first party’s interference and that to 
which it was caused by other factors. 
2. Non-performance caused by event for which party alleging non-
performance bears the risk 
Another possibility is that non-performance may result from an event 
the risk of which is expressly or impliedly allocated by the contract to 
the party alleging non-performance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A, a builder, concludes a construction contract to be performed 
on the premises of B, who already has many buildings on those 
premises which are the subject of an insurance policy covering any 
damage to the buildings. If the parties agree that the risk of 
accidental damage is to fall on B as the person insured, there would 
normally be no reason to reject the parties’ allocation of risk since 
risks of this kind are normally covered by insurance. Even therefore 
if a fire were to be caused by A’s negligence, the risk may be 
allocated to B, although it would clearly need more explicit language 
to carry this result than would be the case if the fire which destroyed 
the building were the fault of neither party. 
ARTICLE  7.1.3 
(Withholding performance) 
(1) Where the parties are to perform 
simultaneously, 
either 
party 
may 
withhold 
performance until the other party tenders its 
performance. 
(2) Where the parties are to perform 
consecutively, the party that is to perform later 
may withhold its performance until the first party 
has performed. 
Art. 7.1.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
230 
COMMENT 
This Article must be read together with Article 6.1.4 (Order of 
performance). This Article is concerned with remedies and corresponds 
in effect to the civil law concept of exceptio non adimpleti contractus. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A agrees to sell B  a thousand tons of white wheat, payment to be 
made by confirmed letter of credit opened on a bank from country X. 
A is not obliged to ship the goods unless and until B opens the letter 
of credit in conformity with its contractual obligations. 
The text does not explicitly address the question which arises where 
one party performs in part but does not perform completely. In such a 
case the party entitled to receive performance may be entitled to 
withhold performance but only where in normal circumstances this is 
consonant with good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7). 
ARTICLE  7.1.4 
(Cure by non-performing party) 
(1) The non-performing party may, at its 
own 
expense, 
cure 
any 
non-performance, 
provided that  
(a) without undue delay, it gives notice 
indicating the proposed manner and timing of the 
cure; 
(b) cure is appropriate in the circum-
stances; 
(c) the aggrieved party has no legitimate 
interest in refusing cure; and 
(d) cure is effected promptly. 
(2) The right to cure is not precluded by 
notice of termination. 
(3) Upon effective notice of cure, rights of 
the aggrieved party that are inconsistent with the 
non-performing 
party’s 
performance 
are 
suspended until the time for cure has expired. 
(4) The aggrieved party may withhold 
performance pending cure. 
 
Non-performance in General 
Art. 7.1.4 
 
231 
(5) Notwithstanding cure, the aggrieved 
party retains the right to claim damages for delay 
as well as for any harm caused or not prevented 
by the cure. 
COMMENT 
1. General principle 
Paragraph (1) of this Article provides that, if certain conditions are 
met, the non-performing party may cure by correcting the non-
performance. In effect, by meeting these conditions, the non-performing 
party is able to extend the time for performance for a brief period 
beyond that stipulated in the contract, unless timely performance is 
required by the agreement or the circumstances. This Article thus 
favours the preservation of the contract. It also reflects the policy of 
minimising economic waste, as incorporated in Article 7.4.8 (Mitigation 
of harm), and the basic principle of good faith stated in Article 1.7. This 
Article is related to the cure provisions contained in Articles 37 and 48 
CISG and in some domestic laws governing contracts and sales. Even 
many of those legal systems that do not have a rule permitting cure 
would normally take a reasonable offer of cure into account in assessing 
damages. 
2. Notice of cure 
Cure may be effected only after the non-performing party gives 
notice of cure. The notice must be reasonable with regard to its timing 
and content as well as to the manner in which it is communicated. 
Notice of cure must be given without undue delay after the non-
performing party learns of the non-performance. To the extent 
information is then available, the notice must indicate how cure is to be 
effected and when. Notice must also be communicated to the aggrieved 
party in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances. 
Notice of cure is considered to be “effective” when the requirements 
of paragraph (1)(a) - (c) have been met. 
3. Appropriateness of cure 
Whether cure is appropriate in the circumstances depends on whether 
it is reasonable, given the nature of the contract, to permit the non-
performing party to make another attempt at performance. As indicated 
in paragraph (2), cure is not precluded merely because the failure to 
perform amounts to a fundamental non-performance. The factors to be 
Art. 7.1.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
232 
considered in determining the appropriateness of cure include whether 
the proposed cure promises to be successful in resolving the problem 
and whether the necessary or probable delay in effecting cure would be 
unreasonable or would itself constitute a fundamental non-performance. 
However, the right to cure is not defeated by the fact that the aggrieved 
party subsequently changes its position. If the non-performing party 
gives effective notice of cure, the aggrieved party’s right to change 
position is suspended. Nonetheless, the situation may be different if the 
aggrieved party has changed position before receiving notice of cure. 
4. The aggrieved party’s interest 
The non-performing party may not cure if the aggrieved party can 
demonstrate a legitimate interest in refusing cure. However, if notice of 
cure is properly given and if cure is appropriate in the circumstances, it 
is presumed that the non-performing party should be permitted to cure. 
A legitimate interest may arise, for example, if it is likely that, when 
attempting cure, the non-performing party will cause damage to person 
or property. On the other hand, a legitimate interest is not present if, on 
the basis of the non-performance, the aggrieved party has simply 
decided that it does not wish to continue contractual relations. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A agrees to construct a road on B’s property. When the road is 
complete, B discovers that the road grade is steeper than the contract 
permits. B also discovers that, during construction, A’s trucks caused 
damage to B’s timber. A gives notice of cure to regrade the road. 
Even if cure would otherwise be appropriate in the circumstances, 
B’s desire to prevent further damage to the timber may provide a 
legitimate interest for refusing cure. 
5. Timing of cure 
Cure must be effected promptly after notice of cure is given. Time is 
of the essence in the exercise of the right to cure. The non-performing 
party is not permitted to lock the aggrieved party into an extended 
waiting period. The lack of inconvenience on the part of the aggrieved 
party does not justify the non-performing party in delaying cure. 
6. Proper forms of cure 
Cure may include repair and replacement as well as any other 
activities that remedy the non-performance and give to the aggrieved 
party all that it is entitled to expect under the contract. Repairs constitute 
cure only when they leave no evidence of the prior non-performance 
 
Non-performance in General 
Art. 7.1.4 
 
233 
and do not threaten the value or the quality of the product as a whole. It 
is left to the courts to determine the number of times the non-performing 
party may attempt a cure. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A agrees to install an assembly line for high temperature 
enamel painting in B’s factory. The motors are installed with 
insufficient lubricant and as a result “lock up” after a few hours of 
operation. A replaces the motors in a timely fashion, but refuses to 
examine and test the rest of the equipment to ensure that other parts 
of the line have not been damaged. A has not effectively cured. 
7. Suspension of other remedies 
When the non-performing party has given effective notice of cure, 
the aggrieved party may, in accordance with paragraph (4), withhold its 
own performance but, pursuant to paragraph (3), may not exercise any 
remedies inconsistent with the non-performing party’s right to cure until 
it becomes clear that a timely and proper cure has not been or will not 
be effected. Inconsistent remedies include giving notice of termination, 
entering into replacement transactions and seeking damages or 
restitution. 
8. Effect of a notice of termination 
If the aggrieved party has rightfully terminated the contract pursuant 
to Articles 7.3.1(1) and 7.3.2(1), the effects of termination (see Articles 
7.3.5, 7.3.6 and 7.3.7) are also suspended by an effective notice of cure. 
If the non-performance is cured, the notice of termination is inoperative. 
On the other hand, termination takes effect if the time for cure has 
expired and any fundamental non-performance has not been cured. 
9. Right of aggrieved party to damages 
Under paragraph (5) of this Article, even a non-performing party 
who successfully cures is liable for any harm that, before cure, was 
occasioned by the non-performance, as well as for any additional harm 
Art. 7.1.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
234 
caused by the cure itself or by the delay or for any harm which the cure 
does not prevent. The principle of full compensation for damage 
suffered, as provided in Article 7.4.2, is fundamental to the Principles. 
10.  The aggrieved party’s obligations 
The decision to invoke this Article rests on the non-performing party. 
Once the aggrieved party receives effective notice of cure, it must 
permit cure and, as provided in Article 5.1.3, cooperate with the non-
performing party. For example, the aggrieved party must permit any 
inspection that is reasonably necessary for the non-performing party to 
effect cure. If the aggrieved party refuses to permit cure when required 
to do so, any notice of termination is ineffective. Moreover, the 
aggrieved party may not seek remedies for any non-performance that 
could have been cured. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
A agrees to construct a shed on B’s property in order to protect 
B’s machinery from the weather. The roof is constructed in a 
defective manner. During a storm, water leaks into the shed and B’s 
machinery is damaged. B gives notice of termination. A gives timely 
notice of cure. B does not wish to deal further with A and refuses the 
cure. If cure is appropriate in the circumstances and the other 
conditions for cure are met, B cannot invoke remedies for the faulty 
construction but can recover for damage caused to the machinery 
before the cure was to be effected. If cure is inappropriate in the 
circumstances, or if the proposed cure would not have solved the 
problem, the contract is terminated by B’s notice. 
ARTICLE  7.1.5 
(Additional period for performance) 
(1) In a case of non-performance the 
aggrieved party may by notice to the other party 
allow 
an 
additional 
period 
of 
time 
for 
performance. 
(2) During the additional period the 
aggrieved party may withhold performance of its 
own reciprocal obligations and may claim 
damages but may not resort to any other remedy. 
If it receives notice from the other party 
 
Non-performance in General 
Art. 7.1.5 
 
235 
that the latter will not perform within that period, 
or if upon expiry of that period due performance 
has not been made, the aggrieved party may 
resort to any of the remedies that may be 
available under this Chapter. 
(3) Where in a case of delay in perform-
ance which is not fundamental the aggrieved 
party has given notice allowing an additional 
period of time of reasonable length, it may 
terminate the contract at the end of that period. If 
the additional period allowed is not of reasonable 
length it shall be extended to a reasonable length. 
The aggrieved party may in its notice provide 
that if the other party fails to perform within the 
period allowed by the notice the contract shall 
automatically terminate. 
(4) Paragraph (3) does not apply where 
the obligation which has not been performed is 
only a minor part of the contractual obligation of 
the non-performing party. 
COMMENT 
This Article deals with the situation where one party performs late 
and the other party is willing to give extra time for performance. It is 
inspired by the German concept of Nachfrist although similar results are 
obtained by different conceptual means in other legal systems. 
1. Special characteristics of late performance 
The Article recognises that late performance is significantly different 
from other forms of defective performance. Late performance can never 
be remedied since once the date for performance has passed it will not 
occur again, but nevertheless in many cases the party who is entitled to 
performance will much prefer even a late performance to no 
performance at all. Secondly, at the moment when a party fails to 
perform on time it is often unclear how late performance will in fact be. 
The commercial interest of the party receiving performance may often 
therefore be that a reasonably speedy completion, although late, will be 
perfectly acceptable but that a long delayed completion will not. The 
procedure enables that party to give the performing party a second 
chance without prejudicing its other remedies. 
Art. 7.1.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
236 
2. Effects of granting extension of time for performance 
The party who grants the extension of time cannot terminate or seek 
specific performance during the extension time. The right to recover 
damages arising from late performance is not affected. 
The position at the end of the period of extension depends on 
whether the late performance was already fundamental at the time when 
the extension was granted. In this situation, if the contract is not 
completely performed during the extension, the right to terminate for 
fundamental non-performance simply springs into life again as soon as 
the extension period expires. On the other hand, if the late performance 
was not yet fundamental, termination would only be possible at the end 
of the period of extension if the extension was reasonable in length.

A agrees to construct a special bullet-proof body for B’s 
Mercedes. The contract provides that the body is to be finished by 1 
February so that the car can be shipped to B’s country of residence. 
On 31 January the car is needed but not yet quite finished. A assures 
B that it will be able to complete the work if given another week and 
B agrees to a week’s extension of time. If the car is finished within 
the week B must accept it but may recover any damages, for 
example extra shipping charges. If the work is not finished within the 
week, B may refuse to accept delivery and terminate the contract. 
2. 
A, a company in country X, concludes a contract with B, a 
company in country Y, to build 100 km. of motorway in the latter 
country. The contract provides that the motorway will be finished 
within two years from the start of the work. After two years, A has 
in fact built 85 km. and it is clear that it will take at least three 
more months to finish the motorway. B gives A notice to complete 
within a further month. B is not entitled to terminate at the end of 
the month because the additional period of time is not reasonable; 
it shall be extended to the reasonable period of three months. 
 
Non-performance in General 
Art. 7.1.6 
 
237 
ARTICLE  7.1.6 
(Exemption clauses) 
A clause which limits or excludes one 
party’s liability for non-performance or which 
permits one party to render performance sub-
stantially different from what the other party 
reasonably expected may not be invoked if it 
would be grossly unfair to do so, having regard to 
the purpose of the contract. 
COMMENT 
1. The need for a special rule on exemption clauses 
The Principles contain no general rule permitting a court to strike 
down abusive or unconscionable contract terms. Apart from the 
principle of good faith and fair dealing (see Article 1.7) which may 
exceptionally be invoked in this respect, there is only one provision 
permitting the avoidance at any time of the contract as a whole as well 
as of any of its individual terms when they unjustifiably give one party 
an excessive advantage (see Article 3.2.7).  
The reason for the inclusion of a specific provision on exemption 
clauses is that they are particularly common in international contract 
practice and tend to give rise to much controversy between the parties. 
Ultimately, this Article has opted in favour of a rule which gives the 
court a broad discretionary power based on the principle of fairness. 
Terms regulating the consequences of non-performance are in principle 
valid but the court may ignore clauses which are grossly unfair. 
2. “Exemption clauses” defined 
For the purpose of this Article exemption clauses are in the first 
instance those terms which directly limit or exclude the non-performing 
party’s liability in the event of non-performance. Such clauses may be 
expressed in different ways (e.g. fixed sum, ceiling, percentage of the 
performance in question, deposit retained).  
Exemption clauses are further considered to be those which permit a 
party to render a performance substantially different from what the other 
party reasonably expected. In practice clauses of this kind are in 
particular those the purpose or effect of which is to allow the performing 
party unilaterally to alter the character of the performance 
Art. 7.1.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
238 
promised in such a way as to transform the contract. Such clauses are to 
be distinguished from those which are limited to defining the 
performance undertaken by the party in question. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A tour operator offers at a high price a tour providing for 
accommodation in specifically designated luxury hotels. A term of 
the contract provides that the operator may alter the accommodation 
if the circumstances so require. If the operator puts up its clients in 
second class hotels, it will be liable to them notwithstanding the 
contractual term since the clients expected to be accommodated in 
hotels of a category similar to that which had been promised. 
2. 
A hotelkeeper exhibits a notice to the effect that the hotel is 
responsible for cars left in the garage but not for objects contained in 
the cars. This term is not an exemption clause for the purpose of this 
Article since its purpose is merely that of defining the scope of the 
hotelkeeper’s obligation. 
3. Exemption clauses to be distinguished from forfeiture clauses 
Exemption clauses are to be distinguished from forfeiture clauses 
which permit a party to withdraw from a contract on payment of an 
indemnity. In practice, however, there may be forfeiture clauses which 
are in reality intended by the parties to operate as disguised exemption 
clauses. 
4. Exemption clauses and agreed payment for non-performance 
A contract term providing that a party who does not perform is to 
pay a specified sum to the aggrieved party for such non-performance 
(see Article 7.4.13) may also have the effect of limiting the 
compensation due to the aggrieved party. In such cases the non-
performing party may not be entitled to rely on the term in question if 
the conditions laid down in this Article are satisfied.

3. 
A enters into a contract with B for the building of a factory. 
The contract contains a penalty clause providing for payment of 
Australian dollars (AUD) 10,000 for each week of delay. The work 
is not completed within the agreed period because A deliberately 
suspends the work for another project which was more lucrative for 
it and in respect of which the penalty for delay was higher. The 
actual harm suffered by B as a result of the delay amounts to AUD 
20,000 per week. A is not entitled to rely on the penalty clause and B 
may recover full compensation of the actual harm sustained, as the 
 
Non-performance in General 
Art. 7.1.6 
 
239 
enforcement of that clause would in the circumstances be grossly 
unfair in view of A’s deliberate non-performance. 
5. Cases where exemption clauses may not be relied upon 
Following the approach adopted in most national legal systems, this 
Article starts out from the assumption that in application of the doctrine 
of freedom of contract (see Article 1.1) exemption clauses are in 
principle valid. A party may not however invoke such a clause if it 
would be grossly unfair to do so. 
This will above all be the case where the term is inherently unfair 
and its application would lead to an evident imbalance between the 
performances of the parties. Moreover, there may be circumstances in 
which even a term that is not in itself manifestly unfair may not be 
relied upon: for instance, where the non-performance is the result of 
grossly negligent conduct or where the aggrieved party could not have 
obviated the consequences of the limitation or exclusion of liability by 
taking out appropriate insurance. 
In all cases regard must be had to the purpose of the contract and in 
particular to what a party could legitimately have expected from the 
performance of the contract.

4. 
A, an accountant, undertakes to prepare B’s accounts. The 
contract contains a term excluding any liability of A for the 
consequences arising from any inaccuracy whatsoever in A’s 
performance of the contract. As a result of a serious mistake by A, B 
pays 100% more taxes than were due. A may not rely on the 
exemption clause which is inherently unfair. 
5. 
A, a warehouse operator, enters into a contract with B for the 
surveillance of its premises. The contract contains a term limiting 
B’s liability. Thefts occur in the terminal resulting in loss exceeding 
the amount of the limitation. Although the term, agreed upon by two 
professional parties, is not inherently unfair, it may not be relied 
upon by B if the thefts were committed by B’s servants in the course 
of their employment. 
6. Consequence of inability to rely on exemption clauses 
If a party is not entitled to rely on an exemption clause, its liability is 
unaffected and the aggrieved party may obtain full compensation for the 
non-performance. Contrary to the rule laid down with respect to agreed 
payment for non-performance in Article 7.4.13, the court has no power 
to modify the exemption clause. 
 
Art. 7.1.7

ARTICLE  7.1.7 
(Force majeure) 
(1) Non-performance by a party is excused 
if that party proves that the non-performance was 
due to an impediment beyond its control and that 
it could not reasonably be expected to have taken 
the impediment into account at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or 
overcome it or its consequences. 
(2) When the impediment is only tempo-
rary, the excuse shall have effect for such period 
as is reasonable having regard to the effect of the 
impediment on the performance of the contract. 
(3) The party who fails to perform must 
give notice to the other party of the impediment 
and its effect on its ability to perform. If the 
notice is not received by the other party within a 
reasonable time after the party who fails to 
perform knew or ought to have known of the 
impediment, it is liable for damages resulting 
from such non-receipt. 
(4) Nothing in this Article prevents a party 
from exercising a right to terminate the contract 
or to withhold performance or request interest on 
money due. 
COMMENT 
1. The notion of force majeure 
This Article covers the ground covered in common law systems by the 
doctrines of frustration and impossibility of performance and in civil 
law systems by doctrines such as force majeure, Unmöglichkeit, etc. but 
it is identical with none of these doctrines. The term “force majeure” 
was chosen because it is widely known in international trade practice, as 
confirmed by the inclusion in many international contracts of so-called 
“force majeure” clauses.

1. 
A, a manufacturer in country X, sells a nuclear power station to 
B, a utility company in country Y. Under the terms of the contract A 
undertakes to supply all the power station’s requirements of uranium 
for ten years at a price fixed for that period, expressed in US dollars 
and payable in New York. The following separate events occur: 
(i) 
After five years the currency of country Y collapses to 1% 
of its value against the dollar at the time of the contract. B is not 
discharged from liability as the parties have allocated this risk by the 
payment provisions. 
(ii) After five years the Government of country Y imposes 
foreign exchange controls which prevent B paying in any currency 
other than that of country Y. B is excused from paying in US dollars. 
A is entitled to terminate the contract to supply uranium. 
(iii) After five years the world uranium market is cornered by 
a group of speculators. The price of uranium on the world market 
rises to ten times the contract figure. A is not excused from 
delivering uranium as this is a risk which was foreseeable at the time 
of making the contract. 
2. Effects of force majeure on the rights and duties of the parties 
The Article does not restrict the rights of the party who has not 
received performance to terminate if the non-performance is 
fundamental. What it does do, where it applies, is to excuse the non-
performing party from liability in damages. 
In some cases the impediment will prevent any performance at all 
but in many others it will simply delay performance and the effect of the 
Article will be to give extra time for performance. It should be noted 
that in this event the extra time may be greater (or less) than the length 
of the interruption because the crucial question will be what is the effect 
of the interruption on the progress of the contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A contracts to lay a natural gas pipeline across country X. 
Climatic conditions are such that it is normally impossible to work 
between 1 November and 31 March. The contract is timed to finish 
on 31 October but the start of work is delayed for a month by a civil 
war in a neighbouring country which makes it impossible to bring in 
all the piping on time. If the consequence is reasonably to prevent 
the completion of the work until its resumption in the following 
spring, A may be entitled to an extension of five months even though 
the delay was itself of one month only.

UNIDROIT Principles 
242 
3. Force majeure and hardship 
This Article must be read together with Chapter 6, Section 2 of the 
Principles dealing with hardship (see Comment 6 on Article 6.2.2). 
4. Force majeure and contract practice 
The definition of force majeure in paragraph (1) of this Article is 
necessarily of a rather general character. International commercial 
contracts often contain much more precise and elaborate provisions in 
this regard. The parties may therefore find it appropriate to adapt the 
content of this Article so as to take account of the particular features of 
the specific transaction. 
5. Long-term contracts 
Force majeure, like hardship, is typically relevant in long-term 
contracts (see Comment 5 on Article 6.2.2), and the same facts may 
present both hardship and force majeure (see Comment 6 on Article 
6.2.2). In the case of hardship, the Principles encourage negotiation 
between the parties to the end of continuing the relationship rather than 
dissolving it (see Article 6.2.3).   
Similarly, in the case of force majeure, parties to long-term contracts 
can anticipate that, in light of the duration and nature of the relationship 
and, possibly, large initial investments whose value would be realised 
only over time, they would have an interest in continuing rather than 
terminating their business relationship. Accordingly, the parties may 
wish to provide in their contract for the continuation, whenever feasible, 
of the business relationship even in the case of force majeure, and 
envisage termination only as a last resort. Such provisions can take a 
number of forms. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
A long-term contract contains a provision to the effect that, 
except where it is clear from the outset that an impediment to a 
party’s performance is of a permanent nature, the obligations of the 
party affected by the impediment are temporarily suspended for the 
length of the impediment, but for no more than 30 days, and any 
right of either party to terminate the contract is similarly suspended. 
The provision also states that, at the end of that time period, if the 
impediment continues the parties will negotiate with a view to 
agreeing to prolong the suspension on terms that are mutually 
agreed. It also states that, if such agreement cannot be reached, 
disputed matters will be referred to a dispute board pursuant to the 
ICC Dispute Board Rules. The parties are bound by that procedure.

SECTION  2: RIGHT TO PERFORMANCE 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  7.2.1 
(Performance of monetary obligation) 
Where a party who is obliged to pay money 
does not do so, the other party may require 
payment. 
COMMENT 
This Article reflects the generally accepted principle that payment of 
money which is due under a contractual obligation can always be 
demanded and, if the demand is not met, enforced by legal action before 
a court. The term “require” is used in this Article to cover both the 
demand addressed to the other party and the enforcement, whenever 
necessary, of such a demand by a court. 
The Article applies irrespective of the currency in which payment is 
due or may be made. In other words, the right of the obligee to require 
payment extends also to cases of payment in a foreign currency. For the 
determination of the currency in which a monetary obligation is due or 
payment may be made, see Articles 6.1.9, 6.1.10 and 7.4.12. 
Exceptionally, the right to require payment of the price of the goods 
or services to be delivered or rendered may be excluded. This is in 
particular the case where a usage requires a seller to resell goods which 
are neither accepted nor paid for by the buyer. For the applicability of 
usages, see Article 1.9. 
ARTICLE  7.2.2 
(Performance of non-monetary obligation) 
Where a party who owes an obligation 
other than one to pay money does not perform, 
the other party may require performance, unless 
(a) performance is impossible in law or in 
fact; 
(b) performance 
or, 
where 
relevant, 
enforcement is unreasonably burdensome or 
expensive; 
Art. 7.2.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
244 
(c) the party entitled to performance may 
reasonably obtain performance from another 
source; 
(d) performance 
is 
of 
an 
exclusively 
personal character; or 
(e) the party entitled to performance does 
not require performance within a reasonable time 
after it has, or ought to have, become aware of the 
non-performance. 
COMMENT 
1. Right to require performance of non-monetary obligations 
In accordance with the general principle of the binding character of 
the contract (see Article 1.3), each party should as a rule be entitled to 
require performance by the other party not only of monetary, but also of 
non-monetary obligations, assumed by that party. While this is not 
controversial in civil law countries, common law systems allow enfor-
cement of non-monetary obligations only in special circumstances.  
Following the basic approach of CISG (Article 46) this Article adopts 
the principle of specific performance, subject to certain qualifications. 
The principle is particularly important with respect to contracts other 
than sales contracts. Unlike the obligation to deliver something, 
contractual obligations to do something or to abstain from doing 
something can often be performed only by the other contracting party 
itself. In such cases the only way of obtaining performance from a party 
who is unwilling to perform is by enforcement. 
2. Remedy not discretionary 
While CISG provides that “a court is not bound to enter a judgement 
for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law 
in respect of similar contracts of sale not governed by [the] Convention” 
(Article 28), under the Principles specific performance is not a 
discretionary remedy, i.e. a court must order performance, unless one of 
the exceptions laid down in this Article applies. 
3. Exceptions to the right to require performance 
a. Impossibility 
A performance which is impossible in law or in fact, cannot be 
required (sub-paragraph (a)). However, impossibility does not nullify a 
 
Right to Performance 
Art. 7.2.2 
 
245 
contract: other remedies may be available to the aggrieved party (see 
Articles 3.1.3 and 7.1.7(4)). 
The refusal of a public permission which is required under the 
applicable domestic law and which affects the validity of the contract 
renders the contract void (see Article 6.1.17(1)), with the consequence 
that the problem of enforceability of the performance cannot arise. 
When, however, the refusal merely renders the performance impossible 
without affecting the validity of the contract (see Article 6.1.17(2)), sub-
paragraph (a) of this Article applies and performance cannot be 
required. 
b. Unreasonable burden 
In exceptional cases, particularly when there has been a drastic 
change of circumstances after the conclusion of a contract, performance, 
although still possible, may have become so onerous that it would run 
counter to the general principle of good faith and fair dealing (see 
Article 1.7) to require it. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
An oil tanker has sunk in coastal waters in a heavy storm. 
Although it would be possible to lift the ship from the bottom of the 
sea, the shipper may not require performance of the contract of 
carriage if this would involve the shipowner in expense vastly 
exceeding the value of the oil (see Article 7.2.2(b)). 
The words “where relevant, enforcement” take account of the fact 
that in common law systems it is the courts and not the obligees who 
supervise the execution of orders for specific performance. As a 
consequence, in certain cases, especially those involving performances 
extended in time, courts in those countries refuse specific performance 
if supervision would impose undue burdens upon courts. 
As to other possible consequences arising from drastic changes of 
circumstances amounting to a case of hardship, see Articles 6.2.1 et seq. 
c. Replacement transaction  
Many goods and services are of a standard kind, i.e. the same goods 
or services are offered by many suppliers. If a contract for such staple 
goods or standard services is not performed, most customers will not 
wish to waste time and effort extracting the contractual performance 
from the other party. Instead, they will go into the market, obtain 
substitute goods or services and claim damages for non-performance. In 
view of this economic reality sub-paragraph (c) excludes specific 
performance whenever the party entitled to performance may reasonably 
Art. 7.2.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
246 
obtain performance from another source. That party may terminate the 
contract and conclude a replacement transaction (see Article 7.4.5).  
The word “reasonably” indicates that the mere fact that the same 
performance can be obtained from another source is not in itself suffi-
cient, since the aggrieved party could not in certain circumstances 
reasonably be expected to have recourse to an alternative supplier. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A, situated in a developing country where foreign exchange is 
scarce, buys a machine of a standard type from B, a manufacturer 
situated in country X, a developed country. In compliance with the 
contract, A pays the price of USD 100,000 before delivery. B does 
not deliver. Although A could obtain the machine from another 
source in country X, it would be unreasonable, in view of the 
scarcity and high price of foreign exchange in its home country, to 
require A to take this course. A is therefore entitled to require 
delivery of the machine from B. 
d. Performance of an exclusively personal character  
Where performance has an exclusively personal character, enforce-
ment would interfere with the personal freedom of the obligor. 
Moreover, enforcement of performance often impairs its quality. The 
supervision of a very personal performance may also give rise to 
insuperable practical difficulties, as is shown by the experience of 
countries which have saddled their courts with this kind of respons-
ibility. For all these reasons, sub-paragraph (d) excludes enforcement of 
performance of an exclusively personal character. 
The precise scope of this exception depends essentially upon the 
meaning of the phrase “exclusively personal character”. The modern 
tendency is to confine this concept to performances of a unique 
character. The exception does not apply to obligations undertaken by a 
company. Nor are ordinary activities of a lawyer, a surgeon or an 
engineer covered by the phrase for they can be performed by other 
persons with the same training and experience. A performance is of an 
exclusively personal character if it is not delegable and requires 
individual skills of an artistic or scientific nature or if it involves a 
confidential and personal relationship. 
 
Right to Performance 
Art. 7.2.3 
 
247 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
3. 
An undertaking by a firm of architects to design a row of ten 
buildings can be specifically enforced as the firm can delegate the 
task to one of the partners or employ an outside architect to perform 
it. 
4. 
By contrast, an undertaking by a world-famous architect to 
design a new city hall embodying the idea of a city of the 21st 
century cannot be enforced because it is highly unique and calls for 
the exercise of very special skills. 
The performance of obligations to abstain from doing something 
does not fall under sub-paragraph (d).  
e. Request within reasonable time  
Performance of a contract often requires special preparation and 
efforts by the obligor. If the time for performance has passed but the 
obligee has failed to demand performance within a reasonable time, the 
obligor may be entitled to assume that the obligee will not insist upon 
performance. If the obligee were to be allowed to leave the obligor in a 
state of uncertainty as to whether performance will be required, the risk 
might arise of the obligee’s speculating unfairly, to the detriment of the 
obligor, upon a favourable development of the market. 
For these reasons sub-paragraph (e) excludes the right to perform-
ance if it is not required within a reasonable time after the obligee has 
become, or ought to have become, aware of the non-performance. 
For a similar rule concerning the loss of the right to terminate the 
contract, see Article 7.3.2(2). 
ARTICLE  7.2.3 
(Repair and replacement of defective performance) 
The right to performance includes in 
appropriate cases the right to require repair, 
replacement, or other cure of defective perform-
ance. The provisions of Articles 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 
apply accordingly. 
Art. 7.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
248 
COMMENT 
1. Right to performance in case of defective performance 
This Article applies the general principles of Articles 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 
to a special, yet very frequent, case of non-performance, i.e. defective 
performance. For the sake of clarity the Article specifies that the right to 
require performance includes the right of the party who has received a 
defective performance to require cure of the defect. 
2. Cure of defective performance 
Under the Principles cure denotes the right both of the non-
performing party to correct its performance (see Article 7.1.4) and of the 
aggrieved party to require such correction by the non-performing party. 
This Article deals with the latter right.  
The Article expressly mentions two specific examples of cure, namely 
repair and replacement. Repairing defective goods (or making good an 
insufficient service) is the most common case and replacement of a 
defective performance is also frequent. The right to require repair or 
replacement may also exist with respect to the payment of money, for 
instance in case of an insufficient payment or of a payment in the wrong 
currency or to an account different from that agreed upon by the parties. 
Apart from repair and replacement there are other forms of cure, 
such as the removal of the rights of third persons over goods or the 
obtaining of a necessary public permission. 
3. Restrictions 
The right to require cure of a defective performance is subject to the 
same limitations as the right to performance in general. 
Most of the exceptions to the right to require performance that are set 
out in Article 7.2.2 are easily applicable to the various forms of cure of a 
defective performance. Only the application of sub-paragraph (b) calls 
for specific comment. In many cases involving small, insignificant 
defects, both replacement and repair may involve “unreasonable effort 
or expense” and are therefore excluded. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A new car is sold which has a small painting defect which decreases 
the value of the car by 0.01% of the purchase price. Repainting 
would cost 0.5% of the purchase price. A claim for repair is excluded 
but the buyer is entitled to require a reduction in the purchase price. 
 
Right to Performance 
Art. 7.2.4 
 
249 
ARTICLE  7.2.4 
(Judicial penalty) 
(1) Where the court orders a party to 
perform, it may also direct that this party pay a 
penalty if it does not comply with the order. 
(2) The penalty shall be paid to the 
aggrieved party unless mandatory provisions of 
the law of the forum provide otherwise. Payment 
of the penalty to the aggrieved party does not 
exclude any claim for damages. 
COMMENT 
1. Judicially imposed penalty 
Experience in some legal systems has shown that the threat of a 
judicially imposed penalty for disobedience is a most effective means of 
ensuring compliance with judgments ordering the performance of 
contractual obligations. Other systems, on the contrary, do not provide 
for such sanctions because they are considered to constitute an 
inadmissible encroachment upon personal freedom. 
This Article takes a middle course by providing for monetary but not 
for other forms of penalty, applicable to all kinds of orders for 
performance including those for payment of money. 
2. Imposition of penalty at discretion of the court 
The use of the word “may” in paragraph (1) of this Article makes it 
clear that the imposition of a penalty is a matter of discretion for the court. 
Its exercise depends upon the kind of obligation to be performed. In the 
case of money judgments, a penalty should be imposed only in 
exceptional situations, especially where speedy payment is essential for 
the aggrieved party. The same is true for obligations to deliver goods. 
Obligations to pay money or to deliver goods can normally be easily 
enforced by ordinary means of execution. By contrast, in the case of 
obligations to do or to abstain from doing something, which moreover 
cannot easily be performed by a third person, enforcement by means of 
judicial penalties is often the most appropriate solution. 
3. Beneficiary 
Legal systems differ as to the question of whether judicial penalties 
should be paid to the aggrieved party, to the State, or to both. Some 
Art. 7.2.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
250 
systems regard payment to the aggrieved party as constituting an 
unjustified windfall benefit which is contrary to public policy. 
While rejecting this latter view and indicating the aggrieved party as 
the beneficiary of the penalty, the first sentence of paragraph (2) of this 
Article expressly mentions the possibility of mandatory provisions of 
the law of the forum not permitting such a solution and indicating other 
possible beneficiaries of judicial penalties. 
4. Judicial penalties distinguished from damages and from agreed 
payment for non-performance 
The second sentence of paragraph (2) makes it clear that a judicial 
penalty paid to the aggrieved party does not affect its claim for 
damages. Payment of the penalty is regarded as compensating the 
aggrieved party for those disadvantages which cannot be taken into 
account under the ordinary rules for the recovery of damages. Moreover, 
since payment of damages will usually occur substantially later than 
payment of a judicial penalty, courts may to some degree be able, in 
measuring the damages, to take the payment of the penalty into account. 
Judicial penalties are moreover to be distinguished from agreed 
payments for non-performance which are dealt with in Article 7.4.13, 
although the latter fulfil a function similar to that of the former. If the 
court considers that the contractual stipulation of the payment of a sum 
in case of non-performance already provides a sufficient incentive for 
performance, it may refuse to impose a judicial penalty. 
5. Form and procedure 
A judicial penalty may be imposed in the form of a lump sum 
payment or of a payment by instalments. 
The procedure relating to the imposition of a judicial penalty is 
governed by the lex fori. 
6. Penalties imposed by arbitrators 
Since according to Article 1.11 “court” includes an arbitral tribunal, 
the question arises of whether arbitrators might also be allowed to 
impose a penalty. 
While a majority of legal systems seems to deny such a power to 
arbitrators, some modern legislation and recent court practice have 
recognised it. This solution, which is in keeping with the increasingly 
important role of arbitration as an alternative means of dispute 
 
Right to Performance 
Art. 7.2.5 
 
251 
resolution, especially in international commerce, is endorsed by the 
Principles. Since the execution of a penalty imposed by arbitrators can 
only be effected by, or with the assistance of, a court, appropriate 
supervision is available to prevent any possible abuse of the arbitrators’ 
power. 
7. Recognition and enforcement of decisions imposing penalties 
Attention must be drawn to the problems of recognition and 
enforcement, in countries other than the forum State, of judicial 
decisions and of arbitral awards imposing penalties. Special rules on this 
matter are sometimes to be found in national law and to some extent in 
international treaties. 
ARTICLE  7.2.5 
(Change of remedy) 
(1) An aggrieved party who has required 
performance of a non-monetary obligation and 
who has not received performance within a 
period fixed or otherwise within a reasonable 
period of time may invoke any other remedy. 
(2) Where the decision of a court for 
performance of a non-monetary obligation cannot 
be enforced, the aggrieved party may invoke any 
other remedy. 
COMMENT 
1. Aggrieved party entitled to change of remedy 
This Article addresses a problem which is peculiar to the right to 
require performance. The aggrieved party may abandon the remedy of 
requiring performance of a non-monetary obligation and opt instead for 
another remedy or remedies. 
This choice is permitted on account of the difficulties usually 
involved in the enforcement of non-monetary obligations. Even if the 
aggrieved party first decides to invoke its right to require performance, 
it would not be fair to confine that party to this single option. The non-
performing party may subsequently become unable to perform, or its 
inability may only become evident during the proceedings. 
Art. 7.2.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
252 
2. Voluntary change of remedy 
Two situations must be addressed. 
In the first case, the aggrieved party has required performance but 
changes its mind before execution of a judgment in its favour, perhaps 
because it has discovered the non-performing party’s inability to 
perform. The aggrieved party now wishes to invoke one or more other 
remedies. Such a voluntary change of remedy can only be admitted if 
the interests of the non-performing party are duly protected. It may have 
prepared for performance, invested effort and incurred expense. For this 
reason paragraph (1) of this Article makes it clear that the aggrieved 
party is entitled to invoke another remedy only if it has not received 
performance within a fixed period or otherwise within a reasonable 
period of time. 
How much additional time must be made available to the non-
performing party for performance depends upon the difficulty which the 
performance involves. The non-performing party has the right to 
perform provided it does so before the expiry of the additional period. 
For similar conditions which restrict the right of termination in case 
of delay in performance, see Article 7.3.2(2). 
3. Unenforceable decision 
Paragraph (2) addresses the second and less difficult case in which 
the aggrieved party has attempted without success to enforce a judicial 
decision or arbitral award directing the non-performing party to 
perform. In this situation it is obvious that the aggrieved party may 
immediately pursue other remedies. 
4. Time limits 
In the event of a subsequent change of remedy the time limit 
provided for a notice of termination under Article 7.3.2(2) must, of 
course, be extended accordingly. The reasonable time for giving notice 
begins to run, in the case of a voluntary change of remedy, after the 
aggrieved party has or ought to have become aware of the non- 
performance at the expiry of the additional period of time available to 
the non-performing party to perform; and in the case of paragraph (2) of 
this Article, it will begin to run after the aggrieved party has or ought to 
have become aware of the unenforceability of the decision or award 
requiring performance. 
253 
SECTION  3: TERMINATION 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  7.3.1 
(Right to terminate the contract) 
(1) A party may terminate the contract 
where the failure of the other party to perform an 
obligation under the contract amounts to a 
fundamental non-performance. 
(2) In determining whether a failure to 
perform an obligation amounts to a fundamental 
non-performance 
regard 
shall 
be 
had, 
in 
particular, to whether 
(a) the 
non-performance 
substantially 
deprives the aggrieved party of what it was 
entitled to expect under the contract unless the 
other party did not foresee and could not 
reasonably have foreseen such result; 
(b) strict compliance with the obligation 
which has not been performed is of essence under 
the contract; 
(c) the non-performance is intentional or 
reckless; 
(d) the 
non-performance 
gives 
the 
aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot 
rely on the other party’s future performance; 
(e) the non-performing party will suffer 
disproportionate loss as a result of the preparation 
or performance if the contract is terminated. 
(3) In the case of delay the aggrieved party 
may also terminate the contract if the other party 
fails to perform before the time allowed it under 
Article 7.1.5 has expired. 
COMMENT 
1. Termination even if non-performance is excused 
The rules set out in this Section are intended to apply both to cases 
where the non-performing party is liable for the non-performance and to 
those where the non-performance is excused so that the aggrieved party 
Art. 7.3.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
254 
can claim neither specific performance nor damages for non-
performance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a company located in country X, buys wine from B in 
country Y. The Government of country X subsequently imposes an 
embargo upon the import of agricultural products from country Y. 
Although the impediment cannot be attributed to A, B may terminate 
the contract. 
2. Right to terminate the contract dependent on fundamental non-
performance 
Whether in a case of non-performance by one party the other party 
should have the right to terminate the contract depends upon the 
weighing of a number of considerations. On the one hand, performance 
may be so late or so defective that the aggrieved party cannot use it for 
its intended purpose, or the behaviour of the non-performing party may 
in other respects be such that the aggrieved party should be permitted to 
terminate the contract. 
On the other hand, termination will often cause serious detriment to 
the non-performing party whose expenses in preparing and tendering 
performance may not be recovered. 
For these reasons paragraph (1) of this Article provides that an 
aggrieved party may terminate the contract only if the non-performance 
of the other party is “fundamental”, i.e. material and not merely of 
minor importance. See also Articles 7.3.3. and 7.3.4. 
3. Circumstances of significance in determining whether non-
performance is fundamental 
Paragraph (2) of this Article lists a number of circumstances which 
are relevant to the determination of whether, in a given case, failure to 
perform an obligation amounts to fundamental non-performance. 
a. Non-performance substantially depriving the other party of its 
expectations 
The first factor referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is that the non-
performance is so fundamental that the aggrieved party is substantially 
deprived of what it was entitled to expect at the time of the conclusion 
of the contract.

2. 
On 1 May A contracts to deliver standard software before 15 
May to B who has requested speedy delivery. If A tenders delivery 
on 15 June, B may refuse delivery and terminate the contract. 
The aggrieved party cannot terminate the contract if the non-
performing party can show that it did not foresee, and could not 
reasonably have foreseen, that the non-performance was fundamental 
for the other party. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
A undertakes to remove waste from B’s site within thirty days 
without specifying the exact date of commencement. B fails to 
inform A that B has hired excavators at high cost to begin work on 
the site on 2 January. B cannot terminate its contract with A on the 
ground that A had not cleared the site on 2 January. 
b. Strict performance of contract of essence 
Paragraph (2)(b) looks not at the actual gravity of the non-
performance but at the nature of the contractual obligation for which 
strict performance might be of essence. Such obligations of strict 
performance are not uncommon in commercial contracts. For example, 
in contracts for the sale of commodities the time of delivery is normally 
considered to be of the essence, and in a documentary credit transaction 
the documents tendered must conform strictly to the terms of the credit. 
c. Intentional non-performance 
Paragraph (2)(c) deals with the situation where the non-performance 
is intentional or reckless. It may, however, be contrary to good faith (see 
Article 1.7) to terminate a contract if the non-performance, even though 
committed intentionally, is insignificant. 
d. No reliance on future performance 
Under paragraph (2)(d) the fact that non-performance gives the 
aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot rely on the other party’s 
future performance is of significance. If a party is to make its 
performance in instalments, and it is clear that a defect found in one of 
the earlier performances will be repeated in all performances, the 
aggrieved party may terminate the contract even if the defects in the 
early instalment would not of themselves justify termination. 
Sometimes an intentional breach may show that a party cannot be 
trusted.
Art. 7.3.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
 
256 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
A, the agent of B, who is entitled to reimbursement for 
expenses, submits false vouchers to B. Although the amounts 
claimed are insignificant, B may treat A’s behaviour as a funda-
mental non-performance and terminate the agency contract. 
e. Disproportionate loss 
Paragraph (2)(e) deals with situations in which a party who fails to 
perform has relied on the contract and has prepared or tendered 
performance. In these cases regard is to be had to the extent to which 
that party suffers disproportionate loss if the non-performance is treated 
as fundamental. Non-performance is less likely to be treated as 
fundamental if it occurs late, after the preparation of performance, than 
if it occurs early before such preparation. Whether a performance 
tendered or rendered can be of any benefit to the non-performing party 
if it is refused or has to be returned to that party is also of relevance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
On 1 May A undertakes to deliver software which is to be 
produced specifically for B. It is agreed that delivery shall be made 
before 31 December. A tenders delivery on 31 January, at which 
time B still needs the software, which A cannot sell to other users. B 
may claim damages from A, but cannot terminate the contract. 
4. Termination after Nachfrist 
Paragraph (3) makes reference to Article 7.1.5, paragraph (3) of 
which provides that the aggrieved party may use the Nachfrist procedure 
to terminate a contract which may not otherwise be terminated in case of 
delay (see Comment 2 on Article 7.1.5). 
ARTICLE  7.3.2 
(Notice of termination) 
(1) The right of a party to terminate the 
contract is exercised by notice to the other party. 
 
Termination 
Art. 7.3.2 
 
257 
(2) If performance has been offered late or 
otherwise does not conform to the contract the 
aggrieved party will lose its right to terminate the 
contract unless it gives notice to the other party 
within a reasonable time after it has or ought to 
have become aware of the offer or of the non-
conforming performance. 
COMMENT 
1. The requirement of notice 
Paragraph (1) of this Article reaffirms the principle that the right of a 
party to terminate the contract is exercised by notice to the other party. 
The notice requirement will permit the non-performing party to avoid 
any loss due to uncertainty as to whether the aggrieved party will accept 
the performance. At the same time it prevents the aggrieved party from 
speculating on a rise or fall in the value of the performance to the 
detriment of the non-performing party.  
2. Performance overdue 
When performance is due but has not been made, the aggrieved 
party’s course of action will depend upon its wishes and knowledge. 
It may be the case that the aggrieved party does not know whether 
the other party intends to perform, and either no longer wants the 
performance or is undecided. In this case the aggrieved party may wait 
and see whether performance is ultimately tendered and make up its 
mind if and when this happens (paragraph (2)). Alternatively, it may 
still want the other party to perform, in which case it must seek 
performance within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have 
become aware of the non-performance (see Article 7.2.2(e)). 
This Article does not deal with the situation where the non-
performing party asks the aggrieved party whether it will accept late 
performance. Nor does it deal with the situation where the aggrieved 
party learns from another source that the non-performing party intends 
nevertheless to perform the contract. In such cases good faith and fair 
dealing (see Article 1.7) may require that the aggrieved party inform the 
other party if it does not wish to accept the late performance. If it does 
not do so, it may be held liable in damages. 
Art. 7.3.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
258 
3. “Reasonable time” 
An aggrieved party who intends to terminate the contract must give 
notice to the other party within a reasonable time after it becomes or 
ought to have become aware of the non-performance (paragraph (2)). 
What is “reasonable” depends upon the circumstances. In situations 
where the aggrieved party may easily obtain a substitute performance 
and may thus speculate on a rise or fall in the price, notice must be 
given without delay. When it must make enquiries as to whether it can 
obtain substitute performance from other sources the reasonable period 
of time will be longer. 
4. Notice must be received 
The notice to be given by the aggrieved party becomes effective 
when the non-performing party receives it (see Article 1.10). 
ARTICLE  7.3.3 
(Anticipatory non-performance) 
Where prior to the date for performance by 
one of the parties it is clear that there will be a 
fundamental non-performance by that party, the 
other party may terminate the contract. 
COMMENT 
This Article establishes the principle that a non-performance which 
is to be expected is to be equated with a non-performance which 
occurred at the time when performance fell due. It is a requirement that 
it be clear that there will be non-performance; a suspicion, even a well-
founded one, is not sufficient. Furthermore, it is necessary that the non-
performance be fundamental and that the party who is to receive 
performance give notice of termination. 
An example of anticipatory non-performance is the case where one 
party declares that it will not perform the contract; however, the 
circumstances also may indicate that there will be a fundamental non-
performance.

A promises to deliver oil to B by M/S Paul at the terminal in country 
X on 3 February. On 25 January M/S Paul is still 2,000 kilometres 
from the terminal. At the speed it is making it will not arrive on 3 
February, but at the earliest on 8 February. As time is of the essence, 
a substantial delay is to be expected, and B may terminate the 
contract before 3 February. 
ARTICLE  7.3.4 
(Adequate assurance of due performance) 
A party who reasonably believes that there 
will be a fundamental non-performance by the 
other party may demand adequate assurance of 
due performance and may meanwhile withhold 
its own performance. Where this assurance is not 
provided within a reasonable time the party 
demanding it may terminate the contract. 
COMMENT 
1. Reasonable expectation of fundamental non-performance 
This Article protects the interest of a party who has reason to believe 
that the other will be unable or unwilling to perform the contract at the 
due date but who cannot invoke Article 7.3.3 since there is still a 
possibility that the other party will or can perform. In the absence of the 
rule laid down in this Article the former party would often be in a 
dilemma. If it were to wait until the due date of performance, and this 
did not take place, it might incur loss. If, on the other hand, it were to 
terminate the contract, and it then became apparent that the contract 
would have been performed by the other party, its action will amount to 
non-performance of the contract, and it will be liable in damages.  
2. Right to withhold performance pending adequate assurance of 
performance 
Consequently this Article enables a party who reasonably believes 
that there will be a fundamental non-performance by the other party to 
demand an assurance of performance from the other party and in the 
Art. 7.3.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
260 
meantime to withhold its own performance. What constitutes an 
adequate assurance will depend upon the circumstances. In some cases 
the other party’s declaration that it will perform will suffice, while in 
others a request for security or for a guarantee from a third person may 
be justified. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, a boatbuilder with only one berth, promises to build a yacht for B 
to be delivered on 1 May, and no later. Soon afterwards, B learns 
from C that A has promised to build a yacht for C during the same 
period. B is entitled to ask A for an adequate assurance that the yacht 
will be delivered on time and A will then have to give B a 
satisfactory explanation of how it intends to perform its contract with 
B. 
3. Termination of the contract 
If adequate assurance of due performance is not given the other party 
may terminate the contract. 
ARTICLE  7.3.5 
(Effects of termination in general) 
(1) Termination of the contract releases 
both parties from their obligation to effect and to 
receive future performance. 
(2) Termination does not preclude a claim 
for damages for non-performance. 
(3) Termination 
does 
not 
affect 
any 
provision in the contract for the settlement of dis-
putes or any other term of the contract which is to 
operate even after termination. 
COMMENT 
1. Termination extinguishes future obligations 
Paragraph (1) of this Article states the general rule that termination 
has effects for the future in that it releases both parties from their duty to 
effect and to receive future performance.

Art. 7.3.5 
 
261 
2. Claim for damages not affected 
The fact that, by virtue of termination, the contract is brought to an 
end, does not deprive the aggrieved party of its right to claim damages 
for non-performance in accordance with the rules laid down in Section 4 
of this Chapter. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n

A sells B specified production machinery. After B has begun to 
operate the machinery serious defects in it lead to a shutdown of B’s 
assembly plant. B declares the contract terminated but may still 
claim damages (see Article 7.3.5(2)).  
3. Contract provisions not affected by termination 
Notwithstanding the general rule laid down in paragraph (1), there 
may be provisions or obligations which survive termination. This is the 
case in particular with provisions or obligations relating to dispute 
settlement and governing law but there may be other provisions or 
obligations which by their very nature are intended to continue to 
operate even after termination, or to operate only upon termination. 
They may relate to provisions on confidentiality, non-competition, 
payment of interest, or unwinding of the contractual relationship (e.g. 
return of inventory, documents or advertising materials; return of media 
or documents containing confidential information; indemnities; 
treatment of intellectual property rights or databases; exit costs, etc.) 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that A 
discloses to B confidential information which is necessary for the 
production and which B agrees not to disclose for as long as it does 
not become public knowledge. The contract further contains a clause 
referring disputes to the courts of A’s country. Even after 
termination of the contract by B, B remains under a duty not to 
disclose the confidential information, and any dispute relating to the 
contract and its effects is to be settled by the courts of A’s country 
(see Article 7.3.5(3)). 
3.  
A, an equipment leasing company established in country X, 
leases a commercial aircraft to B, an airline operating regional flights 
in country Z. The aircraft is registered for nationality purposes in 
country Z in the name of B, as operator. As international aviation 
regulation prevents the redeployment of the aircraft without it being 
de-registered from Z, B has contractually agreed to procure that de-
registration upon termination. B decides to standardise its fleet and 
Art. 7.3.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
262 
terminates the lease. There is no power of attorney previously issued 
to A to arrange for the de-registration and export of the aircraft. B 
has a duty to cooperate with A in obtaining the de-registration and 
necessary administrative authorisations that will allow A to relocate 
the aircraft to another country. 
4. Post-termination obligations in long-term contracts 
The issue of post-termination obligations is particularly relevant for 
long-term contracts. In relation to surviving provisions, the parties 
should consider addressing the following issues: which provisions are to 
survive termination; whether such provisions are binding on one or both 
parties after termination; how long they survive, who will bear the cost; 
which remedies are available in case of non-performance, etc. Surviving 
provisions may be dealt with in various ways: by a general clause 
stating that all provisions which by their nature are intended to operate 
even after termination will remain in force; by listing the specific 
provisions intended to survive; or by stating in the provision concerned 
that it is to remain in force notwithstanding termination. Contract 
drafters should pay close attention to the compatibility of the surviving 
duties with mandatory domestic law (e.g. limitations on prohibitions to 
compete).   
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3. The contract between 
A and B contains an indemnification clause by the latter in favour of 
the former for losses attributable to the delay in de-registration of the 
aircraft, which is expressed to survive contractual termination. That 
indemnification clause operates and is enforceable independent of any 
damage claim under the terminated contract, though the payment 
thereof would impact the calculation of damages under such contract. 
5.  
Consultant A undertakes to provide consultancy services for a 
new product to Client B for an indefinite period. Intellectual property 
rights arising out of A’s services remain at all times with B, with 
royalties being payable for a period of fifteen years from the date of 
first sale. Five years after the duty to pay royalties by B to A has 
arisen, the contract is terminated pursuant to Article 5.1.8. B’s 
obligation to pay royalties will survive termination during the 
remaining period of ten years. 
6. 
Client A and Provider B are parties to an agreement under 
which a telecommunication system is to be provided by B to A. 
According to the agreement, B shall, upon termination, assist A in 
 
Termination 
Art. 7.3.6 
 
263 
the migration of the services to an alternative provider and A is to 
pay the exit costs. The agreement is terminated. B is under a duty to 
assist A in migrating the system with A paying the exit costs. 
ARTICLE  7.3.6 
(Restitution with respect to contracts  
to be performed at one time) 
(1) On termination of a contract to be 
performed at one time either party may claim 
restitution of whatever it has supplied under the 
contract, provided that such party concurrently 
makes restitution of whatever it has received 
under the contract. 
(2) If restitution in kind is not possible or 
appropriate, an allowance has to be made in 
money whenever reasonable. 
(3) The recipient of the performance does 
not have to make an allowance in money if the 
impossibility to make restitution in kind is 
attributable to the other party. 
(4) Compensation may be claimed for 
expenses reasonably required to preserve or 
maintain the performance received. 
COMMENT 
1. Contracts to be performed at one time 
Paragraph (1) of this Article refers only to contracts to be performed 
at one time or under which at least the characteristic performance has to 
be made at one time, while a different rule applies to long-term 
contracts (see Article 7.3.7(1)). The most common example of a 
contract to be performed at one time is an ordinary contract of sale 
where the entire object of the sale has to be transferred at one particular 
moment. 
Under a commercial contract one party will usually have to pay 
money for the performance received. That obligation is not the one that 
is characteristic of the contract. Thus, a contract of sale where the 
purchase price has to be paid in instalments, will fall under this Article 
provided that the seller’s performance is to be made at one time. 
Art. 7.3.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
264 
2. Right of parties to restitution on termination 
Paragraph (1) of this Article gives each party a right to claim the return 
of whatever the party has supplied under the contract provided that that 
party concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
1.  
In the process of a takeover of a company, controlling 
shareholder A agrees to sell and transfer to B shares for GBP 
1,000,000. B only pays GBP 600,000 after the shares have been 
transferred and A therefore terminates the contract. A can claim back 
the shares. At the same time, A has to return the GBP 600,000 
received from B. 
This rule also applies when the aggrieved party has made a bad 
bargain. If, in the case mentioned in Illustration 1, the real market value 
of the shares is GBP 1,200,000, A may still require the return of the 
shares. 
This Article also applies to the situation where the aggrieved party 
has supplied money in exchange for property, services, or other 
performances which the party has not received or which are defective. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
2.  
Art dealer A sells a Constable painting to art dealer B for EUR 
600,000. B only pays EUR 200,000 for the painting, and A therefore 
terminates the contract. Subsequently it turns out that the painting is 
not a Constable but a copy. On termination of the contract, B can 
reclaim the purchase price and must return the painting to A. 
As regards the costs involved in making restitution, Article 6.1.11 
applies. 
3. Restitution in kind not possible or appropriate 
Restitution must normally be made in kind. There are, however, 
instances where instead of restitution in kind, an allowance in money 
has to be made. This is the case first of all where restitution in kind is 
not possible. The allowance will normally amount to the value of the 
performance received. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
3.  
Company A, which has contracted to excavate company B’s 
site, leaves it after only part of the work has been done. B, which 
then terminates the contract, will have to pay A a sum in 
compensation for the work done, measured by the value that work 
 
Termination 
Art. 7.3.6 
 
265 
has for B. At the same time B will have a claim against A for 
whatever damages B may have suffered as a result of A’s breach of 
contract (see Article 7.3.5(2)). 
4.  
Company A charters a ship for a company cruise for its 
employees which is to take them up the Australian Coral Reef. Half-
way the cruise ship breaks down and cannot continue the cruise. A 
terminates the contract with B, the owner of the business organising 
the cruise, and decides to fly its employees home. If A had already 
paid the price A can now claim it back. At the same time, A owes B 
an allowance amounting to the value of the cruise so far. In addition, 
A can claim damages for the loss suffered as a result of B’s non-
performance (see Article 7.3.5(2)). 
An allowance is further envisaged by paragraph (2) of this Article 
whenever restitution in kind would not be appropriate. This is so in 
particular when returning the performance in kind would cause 
unreasonable effort or expense. The standard, in that respect, is the same 
as under Article 7.2.2(b). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
5.  
A, an artist, sells 200 silver-plated rings to dealer B. B fails to 
pay for the rings and A thereupon terminates the contract. It turns out 
that B has, in the meantime, attempted to ship the rings to his business 
premises. However, the boat on which they had been stored has sunk. 
Although it would be possible, at great expense, to rescue the rings 
from the wrecked ship, this cannot be expected of B. B has to pay a 
reasonable sum to A, measured by the value of the rings. 
The purpose of specifying that an allowance has to be made in 
money “whenever reasonable” is to make it clear that an allowance only 
has to be made if, and to the extent that, the performance has conferred a 
benefit on its recipient. That is not the case, for example, where the 
defect which gives the recipient of the performance a right to terminate 
has only become apparent in the course of processing the object of that 
performance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
6.  
Company A hires company B to develop a specialised software 
to improve its existing internal communication system. Once B has 
developed and installed the software, the software does not perform 
the functions it was intended to. A can terminate the contract and re-
claim the price paid, but since the installed system has no value for 
A, it would not be reasonable to expect A to pay B an allowance for 
the installed software. 
Art. 7.3.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
266 
4. The allocation of risk 
The rule contained in paragraph (2) implies an allocation of risk: it 
imposes a liability on the recipient of the performance to make good the 
value of that performance if it is unable to make restitution in kind. The 
rule in paragraph (2) applies even if the recipient was responsible for the 
deterioration or destruction of what it had received. Such allocation of 
the risk of deterioration or destruction is justified, in particular, because 
the risk should lie with the person in control of the performance. On the 
contrary, there is no liability to make good the value where the 
deterioration or destruction is attributable to the other party: either 
because it was due to the other party’s fault, or because it was due to a 
defect inherent in the performance. Hence the rule in paragraph (3). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
7.  
Manufacturer A sells and delivers a luxury car to company B. 
The car has defective brakes. Due to this defect it crashes into 
another car and is totally destroyed. Since the car was unfit to be 
used for its intended purpose, B can terminate the contract and 
reclaim the purchase price. B does not have to make an allowance 
for not being able to return the car. 
The recipient’s liability to make good the value of the performance 
received is not excluded in cases where the deterioration or destruction 
would also have occurred had the performance not been rendered. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
8.  
Manufacturer A sells and delivers a car to company B. After 
delivery has taken place, the car is totally destroyed by a hurricane 
flooding the properties of both A and B. B terminates the contract 
because of a defect attaching to the car. B can reclaim the purchase 
price but, at the same time, has to make an allowance for the value of 
the car prior to its destruction. 
The question of the recipient’s liability to pay the value of the 
performance only arises in cases where the deterioration or destruction 
occurs before termination of the contract. If what has been performed 
deteriorates or is destroyed after termination of the contract, the normal 
rules on non-performance apply, as after termination the recipient of the 
performance is under a duty to return what the recipient has received. 
Any non-performance of that duty gives the other party a right to claim 
damages according to Article 7.4.1, unless the non-performance is 
excused under Article 7.1.7.

9.  
Company A sells and delivers to company B a limousine with a 
leaking roof. Since the limousine is unfit to be used for its intended 
purpose, B can terminate the contract. As a result, B can reclaim the 
purchase price but is under a duty to return the limousine. Before B 
can return the car it is totally destroyed by a thunderstorm. A cannot 
claim damages because B is excused under Article 7.1.7. 
5. Compensation for expenses 
The recipient of a performance may have incurred expenses for the 
preservation or maintenance of the object of the performance. It is 
reasonable to allow the recipient to claim compensation for these 
expenses where the contract has been terminated and where, therefore, 
the parties have to return what they have received. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
10.  Company A has sold and delivered a race horse to company B. 
Some time later it becomes apparent that the horse is not, as A had 
promised, a descendant of a particular stallion. B terminates the 
contract. B can claim compensation for the costs incurred in feeding 
and caring for the horse. 
This rule applies only to reasonable expenses. What is reasonable 
depends on the circumstances of the case. In Illustration 10 it would 
matter whether the horse had been sold as a race horse or as an ordinary 
farm horse. 
Compensation cannot be claimed for other expenses linked to the 
performance received, even if they are reasonable. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
11.  Company A has sold and delivered a software package to 
company B. B then discovers that the software is lacking a certain 
functionality it was supposed to have. B therefore asks software 
expert C to check whether that functionality can still be imple-
mented. Since that turns out not to be possible, B terminates the 
contract. B cannot recover the fee paid to C as expenses under 
paragraph (4) from A. 
6. Benefits 
The Principles do not take a position concerning benefits that have 
been derived from the performance, or interest that has been earned. In 
commercial practice it will often be difficult to establish the value of the 
Art. 7.3.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
268 
benefits received by the parties as a result of the performance. 
Furthermore, often both parties will have received such benefits. 
7. Rights of third persons not affected 
In common with other Articles of the Principles, this Article deals 
with the relationship between the parties and not with any rights on the 
goods concerned that third persons may have acquired. Whether, for 
instance, an obligee of the buyer, the buyer’s receivers in bankruptcy, or 
a purchaser in good faith may oppose the restitution of goods sold is to 
be determined by the applicable law. 
ARTICLE  7.3.7 
(Restitution with respect to long-term contracts) 
(1) On termination of a long-term contract 
restitution can only be claimed for the period after 
termination has taken effect, provided the contract 
is divisible. 
(2) As far as restitution has to be made, 
the provisions of Article 7.3.6 apply. 
COMMENT 
1. Long-term contracts 
Unlike the rule in paragraph (1) of Article 7.3.6 with respect to 
contracts to be performed at one time, paragraph (1) of this Article 
provides that, on termination of a long-term contract, restitution can 
only be claimed for the period after termination has taken effect, 
provided the contract is divisible. Indeed, because under such contracts 
performance might have been made over a long period of time before 
the contract is terminated, it may be inconvenient to unravel that 
performance. Furthermore, termination is a remedy with prospective 
effect only (see Article 7.3.5). Restitution can, therefore, only be 
claimed in respect of the period after termination. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
1.  
A contracts to service B’s computer hardware and software for 
a period of five years. After three years of regular service A is 
obliged by illness to discontinue the services and the contract is 
terminated. B, who has paid A for the fourth year, can claim 
 
Termination 
Art. 7.3.7 
 
269 
restitution of the advance payment for that year but not for the 
money paid for the three years of regular service. 
 
Since contracts are terminated only for the future, any outstanding 
payments for past performance can still be claimed. This Article does 
not prevent a claim for damages being brought. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2.  
Company A leases equipment to company B for three years at a 
rental of EUR 10,000 a month. B pays punctually for the first two 
months but then fails to make any further payments despite repeated 
requests by A. After a lapse of five months A terminates the lease. A 
is entitled to retain the EUR 20,000 already received (see Article 
7.3.7(1)) and to recover the EUR 50,000 accrued due (on the basis of 
the contract of lease which is terminated only for the future), 
together with whatever damages for breach it has sustained (see 
Article 7.3.5(2)). 
3.  
A, a hospital, engages B to carry out cleaning services for the 
hospital, the contract to run for three years. After a year B informs A 
that it cannot continue with the cleaning services unless the price is 
doubled. A refuses to agree and B ceases to provide the service. On 
terminating the contract A can recover damages for any additional 
expense it incurs in hiring another cleaning firm (see Article 7.4.1 in 
conjunction with Article 7.3.5(2)), while B is entitled to retain the 
payments it has received for services already provided (see 
Article 7.3.7(1)). 
The rule that restitution can only be claimed for the period after 
termination has taken effect does not apply if the contract is indivisible. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4.  
A undertakes to paint ten pictures depicting one and the same 
historical event for B’s festival hall. After delivering and having 
been paid for five paintings, A abandons the work. In view of the 
fact that the decoration of the hall is supposed to consist of ten 
paintings to be painted by the same painter and showing different 
aspects of one historical event, B can claim the return of the 
advances paid to A and must return the five paintings to A. 
2. Restitution 
This Article is a special rule which, for long-term contracts, excludes 
restitution for performance made in the past. To the extent that there is 
restitution under this Article, it is governed by the provisions of Article 
7.3.6. 
 
270 
SECTION  4: DAMAGES 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  7.4.1 
(Right to damages) 
Any non-performance gives the aggrieved 
party a right to damages either exclusively or in 
conjunction with any other remedies except 
where the non-performance is excused under 
these Principles. 
COMMENT 
1. Right to damages in general 
This Article establishes the principle of a general right to damages in 
the event of non-performance, except where the non-performance is 
excused under the Principles, as in the case of force majeure (see Article 
7.1.7) or of an exemption clause (see Article 7.1.6). Hardship (see 
Article 6.2.1 et seq.) does not in principle give rise to a right to 
damages. 
The Article recalls that the right to damages, like other remedies, 
arises from the sole fact of non-performance. It is enough for the 
aggrieved party simply to prove the non-performance, i.e. that it has not 
received what it was promised. In particular, it is not necessary in 
addition to prove that the non-performance was due to the fault of the 
non-performing party. The degree of difficulty in proving the non-
performance will depend upon the content of the obligation and in 
particular on whether the obligation is one of best efforts or one to 
achieve a specific result (see Article 5.1.4). 
The right to damages exists in the event of failure to perform any of 
the obligations which arise from the contract. Thus, it is not necessary to 
draw a distinction between principal and accessory obligations. 
2. Damages may be combined with other remedies 
This Article also states that the aggrieved party may request damages 
either as an exclusive remedy (for example, damages for delay in the 
case of late performance or for defective performance accepted by the 
aggrieved party; damages in the event of impossibility of performance 
for which the non-performing party is liable), or in conjunction
 
Damages 
Art. 7.4.2 
 
271 
with other remedies. Thus, in the case of termination of the contract, 
damages may be requested to compensate the loss arising from such 
termination, or again, in the case of specific performance, to compensate 
for the delay with which the aggrieved party receives performance and 
for any expenses which might have been incurred. Damages may also be 
accompanied by other remedies (cure, publication in newspapers of, for 
example, an admission of error, etc.). 
3. Damages and pre-contractual liability 
The right to damages may arise not only in the context of non-
performance of the contract, but also during the pre-contractual period 
(see, for instance, Article 2.1.15 in case of negotiations in bad faith, 
Article 2.1.16 in the event of breach of the duty of confidentiality, or 
Article 3.2.16 in the case of mistake, fraud, threat or gross disparity). 
The rules governing damages for non-performance as laid down in this 
Section may be applied by analogy to those situations. 
ARTICLE  7.4.2 
(Full compensation) 
(1) The aggrieved party is entitled to full 
compensation for harm sustained as a result of 
the non-performance. Such harm includes both 
any loss which it suffered and any gain of which it 
was deprived, taking into account any gain to the 
aggrieved party resulting from its avoidance of 
cost or harm. 
(2) Such harm may be non-pecuniary and 
includes, for instance, physical suffering or 
emotional distress. 
COMMENT 
1. Aggrieved party entitled to full compensation 
Paragraph (1) of this Article establishes the principle of the 
aggrieved party’s entitlement to full compensation for the harm it has 
sustained as a result of the non-performance of the contract. It further 
affirms the need for a causal link between the non-performance and the 
Art. 7.4.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
272 
harm (see also Comment 3 on Article 7.4.3). Non-performance must be 
a source neither of gain nor of loss for the aggrieved party. 
The solution to be found in some legal systems which allows the 
court to reduce the amount of damages having regard to the 
circumstances has not been followed, since in international situations it 
could risk creating a considerable degree of uncertainty and its 
application might moreover vary from one court to another. 
2. Damages cover loss suffered, including loss of profit 
In specifying the harm for which damages are recoverable, paragraph 
(1) of this Article, following the rule laid down in Article 74 CISG, 
states that the aggrieved party is entitled to compensation in respect not 
only of loss which it has suffered, but also of any gain of which it has 
been deprived as a consequence of the non-performance. 
The notion of loss suffered must be understood in a wide sense. It 
may cover a reduction in the aggrieved party’s assets or an increase in 
its liabilities which occurs when an obligee, not having been paid by its 
obligor, must borrow money to meet its commitments. The loss of profit 
or, as it is sometimes called, consequential loss, is the benefit which 
would normally have accrued to the aggrieved party if the contract had 
been properly performed. The benefit will often be uncertain so that it 
will frequently take the form of the loss of a chance (see Article 
7.4.3(2)). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A national library sends a rare manuscript by special courier 
abroad for an exhibition. The manuscript is irreparably damaged 
during transport. Its loss in value is estimated at EUR 100,000 and it 
is this sum which is due by the courier. 
2. 
A, who has not been paid by B under the terms of their 
contract, must borrow money from its bank at a high rate of interest. 
B must compensate A for the interest due by the latter to its bank. 
3. 
A, a construction company, hires a crane from company B. The 
boom of the crane, which has been poorly maintained, breaks and in 
falling crushes the architect’s car and results in an interruption of 
work on the site for eight days, for which A must pay a penalty for 
delay of EUR 50,000 to the owner. B must reimburse A for the 
expenses incurred as a consequence of the interruption of the work, 
the amount of the penalty and the cost of repairing the architect’s car 
which A has had to pay. 
4. 
A, a singer, cancels an engagement with B, an impresario. A 
must pay damages to B in respect not only of the expenses incurred 
 
Damages 
Art. 7.4.2 
 
273 
by B in preparing the concert, but also of the loss of profit resulting 
from the cancellation of the concert. 
3. Damages must not enrich the aggrieved party 
However, the aggrieved party must not be enriched by damages for 
non-performance. It is for this reason that paragraph (1) also provides 
that account must be taken of any gain resulting to the aggrieved party 
from the non-performance, whether that be in the form of expenses 
which it has not incurred (e.g. it does not have to pay the cost of a hotel 
room for an artist who fails to appear), or of a loss which it has avoided 
(e.g. in the event of non-performance of what would have been a losing 
bargain for it). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
A rents out excavating machinery to B for two years at a 
monthly rental of EUR 10,000. The contract is terminated after six 
months for non-payment of the rentals. Six months later, A succeeds 
in renting out the same machinery at a monthly charge of EUR 
11,000. The gain of EUR 12,000 realised by A as a result of the re-
letting of the machinery for the remainder of the initial contract, that 
is to say one year, should be deducted from the damages due by B to 
A. 
4. Damages in case of changes in the harm 
In application of the principle of full compensation regard is to be 
had to any changes in the harm, including its expression in monetary 
terms, which may occur between the time of the non-performance and 
that of the judgment. The rule however is not without exceptions: for 
example, if the aggrieved party has itself already made good the harm at 
its own expense, the damages awarded will correspond to the amount of 
the sums disbursed. 
5. Compensation of non-material harm 
Paragraph (2) of this Article expressly provides for compensation 
also of non-pecuniary harm. This may be pain and suffering, loss of 
certain amenities of life, aesthetic prejudice, etc. as well as harm 
resulting from attacks on honour or reputation. 
Art. 7.4.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
274 
The rule might find application, in international commerce, in regard 
to contracts concluded by artists, outstanding sportsmen or women and 
consultants engaged by a company or by an organisation. 
In these cases also, the requirement of the certainty of harm must be 
satisfied (see Article 7.4.3), together with the other conditions for 
entitlement to damages. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
6. 
A, a young architect who is beginning to build up a certain 
reputation, signs a contract for the modernisation of a municipal fine 
arts museum. The appointment receives wide press coverage. The 
municipal authorities subsequently decide to engage the services of a 
more experienced architect and terminate the contract with A. A may 
obtain compensation not only for the material loss suffered but also 
for the harm to A’s reputation and the loss of the chance of 
becoming better known which the commission would have provided. 
The compensation of non-material harm may assume different forms 
and it is for the court to decide which of them, whether taken alone or 
together, best assures full compensation. The court may not only award 
damages but also order other forms of redress such as the publication of 
a notice in newspapers designated by it (e.g. in case of breach of a 
clause prohibiting competition or the reopening of a business, 
defamation etc.). 
ARTICLE  7.4.3 
(Certainty of harm) 
(1) Compensation is due only for harm, 
including future harm, that is established with a 
reasonable degree of certainty. 
(2) Compensation may be due for the loss 
of a chance in proportion to the probability of its 
occurrence. 
(3) Where the amount of damages cannot 
be established with a sufficient degree of 
certainty, the assessment is at the discretion of the 
court.

COMMENT 
1. Occurrence of harm must be reasonably certain 
This Article reaffirms the well-known requirement of certainty of 
harm, since it is not possible to require the non-performing party to 
compensate harm which may not have occurred or which may never 
occur. 
Paragraph (1) permits the compensation also of future harm, i.e. 
harm which has not yet occurred, provided that it is sufficiently certain. 
Paragraph (2) in addition covers loss of a chance, obviously only in 
proportion to the probability of its occurrence: thus, the owner of a 
horse which arrives too late to run in a race as a result of delay in 
transport cannot recover the whole of the prize money, even though the 
horse was the favourite. 
2. Determination of extent of harm 
Certainty relates not only to the existence of the harm but also to its 
extent. There may be harm the existence of which cannot be disputed 
but which it is difficult to quantify. This will often be the case in respect 
of loss of a chance (there are not always “odds” as there are for a horse, 
for example for an engineering company preparing for the making of a 
bid) or of compensation for non-material harm (detriment to someone’s 
reputation, pain and suffering, etc.). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A entrusts a file to B, an express delivery company, in response to an 
invitation to submit tenders for the construction of an airport. B 
undertakes to deliver the file before the closing date for tenders but 
delivers it after that date and A’s application is refused. The amount 
of compensation will depend upon the degree of probability of A’s 
tender having been accepted and calls for a comparison of it with the 
applications 
which 
were 
admitted 
for 
consideration. 
The 
compensation will therefore be calculated as a proportion of the 
profit which A might have made. 
According to paragraph (3), where the amount of damages cannot be 
established with a sufficient degree of certainty then, rather than refuse 
any compensation or award nominal damages, the court is empowered 
to make an equitable quantification of the harm sustained. 
Art. 7.4.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
276 
3. Harm must be a direct consequence of non-performance as well 
as certain 
There is a clear connection between the certainty and the direct 
nature of the harm. Although the latter requirement is not expressly 
dealt with by the Principles, it is implicit in Article 7.4.2(1) which refers 
to the harm sustained “as a result of the non-performance” and which 
therefore presupposes a sufficient causal link between the non-
performance and the harm. Harm which is too indirect will usually also 
be uncertain as well as unforeseeable. 
ARTICLE  7.4.4 
(Foreseeability of harm) 
The non-performing party is liable only for 
harm which it foresaw or could reasonably have 
foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the 
contract as being likely to result from its non-
performance. 
COMMENT 
The principle of limitation of recoverable harm to that which is 
foreseeable corresponds to the solution adopted in Article 74 CISG. 
This limitation is related to the very nature of the contract: not all the 
benefits of which the aggrieved party is deprived fall within the scope of 
the contract and the non-performing party must not be saddled with 
compensation for harm which it could never have foreseen at the time of 
the conclusion of the contract and against the risk of which it could not 
have taken out insurance. 
The requirement of foreseeability must be seen in conjunction with 
that of certainty of harm set out in Article 7.4.3. 
The concept of foreseeability must be clarified since the solution 
contained in the Principles does not correspond to certain national 
systems which allow compensation even for harm which is 
unforeseeable when the non-performance is due to wilful misconduct or 
gross negligence. Since the present rule does not provide for such an 
exception, a narrow interpretation of the concept of foreseeability is 
called for. Foreseeability relates to the nature or type of the harm but not 
to its extent unless the extent is such as to transform the harm into one 
of a different kind. In any event, foreseeability is a flexible concept 
which leaves a wide measure of discretion to the judge. 
 
Damages 
Art. 7.4.5 
 
277 
What was foreseeable is to be determined by reference to the time of 
the conclusion of the contract and to the non-performing party itself 
(including its servants or agents), and the test is what a normally diligent 
person could reasonably have foreseen as the consequences of non-
performance in the ordinary course of things and the particular 
circumstances of the contract, such as the information supplied by the 
parties or their previous transactions. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A cleaning company orders a machine which is delivered five 
months late. The manufacturer is obliged to compensate the company 
for lost profit caused by the delay in delivery as it could have foreseen 
that the machine was intended for immediate use. On the other hand 
the harm does not include the loss of a valuable Government contract 
that could have been concluded if the machine had been delivered on 
time since that kind of harm was not foreseeable. 
2. 
A, a bank, usually employs the services of a security company 
for the conveyance of bags containing coins to its branches. Without 
informing the security company, A sends a consignment of bags 
containing new coins for collectors worth fifty times the value of 
previous consignments. The bags are stolen in a hold-up. A can only 
recover compensation corresponding to the value of the normal 
consignments as this was the only kind of harm that could have been 
foreseen and the value of the items lost was such as to transform the 
harm into one of another kind. 
Unlike certain international conventions, particularly in the field of 
transport, the Principles follow CISG in not making provision for full 
compensation of harm, albeit unforeseeable, in the event of intentional 
non-performance. 
ARTICLE  7.4.5 
(Proof of harm in case of  
replacement transaction) 
Where the aggrieved party has terminated 
the contract and has made a replacement 
transaction within a reasonable time and in a 
reasonable manner it may recover the difference 
between the contract price and the price of the 
replacement transaction as well as damages for 
any further harm. 
Art. 7.4.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
278 
COMMENT 
1. Amount of harm presumed in case of replacement transaction  
It seems advisable to establish, alongside the general rules applicable 
to the proof of the existence and of the amount of the harm, 
presumptions which may facilitate the task of the aggrieved party. 
The first of these presumptions is provided by this Article which 
corresponds in substance to Article 75 CISG. It concerns the situation 
where the aggrieved party has made a replacement transaction, for instance 
because so required by the duty to mitigate harm or in conformity with 
usages. In such cases, the harm is considered to be the difference between 
the contract price and the price of the replacement transaction. 
The presumption comes into play only if there is a replacement trans-
action and not where the aggrieved party has itself performed the 
obligation which lay upon the non-performing party (for example when 
a shipowner itself carries out the repairs to its vessel following the failure 
to do so of the shipyard which had been entrusted with the work). 
Nor is there replacement, and the general rules will apply, when a 
company, after the termination of a contract, uses its equipment for the 
performance of another contract which it could have performed at the 
same time as the first (“lost volume”). 
The replacement transaction must be performed within a reasonable 
time and in a reasonable manner so as to avoid the non-performing party 
being prejudiced by hasty or malicious conduct. 
2. Further damages recoverable for additional harm 
The rule that the aggrieved party may recover the difference between 
the two contract prices establishes a minimum right of recovery. The 
aggrieved party may also obtain damages for additional harm which it 
may have sustained. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A, a shipyard, undertakes to accommodate a ship belonging to B, a 
shipowner, in dry dock for repairs costing USD 500,000 as from 1 
July. B learns on 1 June that the dry dock will only be available as 
from 1 August. B terminates the contract and after lengthy and costly 
negotiations concludes with C, another shipyard, an identical 
contract at a price of USD 700,000. B is entitled to recover from A 
not only the difference in the price of USD 200,000 but also the 
expenses it has incurred and compensation for the longer period of 
unavailability of the ship. 
 
Damages 
Art. 7.4.6

ARTICLE  7.4.6 
(Proof of harm by current price) 
(1) Where 
the 
aggrieved 
party 
has 
terminated the contract and has not made a 
replacement transaction but there is a current 
price for the performance contracted for, it may 
recover the difference between the contract price 
and the price current at the time the contract is 
terminated as well as damages for any further 
harm. 
(2) Current price is the price generally 
charged for goods delivered or services rendered 
in comparable circumstances at the place where 
the contract should have been performed or, if 
there is no current price at that place, the current 
price at such other place that appears reasonable 
to take as a reference. 
COMMENT 
1. Amount of harm presumed when no replacement transaction 
The purpose of this Article, which corresponds in substance to 
Article 76 CISG, is to facilitate proof of harm where no replacement 
transaction has been made, but there exists a current price for the 
performance contracted for. In such cases the harm is presumed to be 
equal to the difference between the contract price and the price current 
at the time the contract was terminated. 
2. Determination of “current price” 
According to paragraph (2) “current price” is the price generally 
charged for the goods or services in question. The price will be 
determined in comparison with that which is charged for the same or 
similar goods or services. This will often, but not necessarily, be the 
price on an organised market. Evidence of the current price may be 
obtained from professional organisations, chambers of commerce etc.  
For the purpose of this Article the place relevant for determining the 
current price is that where the contract should have been performed or, 
if there is no current price at that place, the place that appears reasonable 
to take as a reference. 
Art. 7.4.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
280 
3. Further damages recoverable for additional harm 
The rule that the aggrieved party may recover the difference between 
the contract price and the current price at the time of termination 
establishes only a minimum right of recovery. The aggrieved party may 
also obtain damages for additional harm which it may have sustained as 
a consequence of termination. 
ARTICLE  7.4.7 
(Harm due in part to aggrieved party) 
Where the harm is due in part to an act or 
omission of the aggrieved party or to another 
event for which that party bears the risk, the 
amount of damages shall be reduced to the extent 
that these factors have contributed to the harm, 
having regard to the conduct of each of the 
parties. 
COMMENT 
1. Contribution of the aggrieved party to the harm 
In application of the general principle established by Article 7.1.2 
which restricts the exercise of remedies where non-performance is in 
part due to the conduct of the aggrieved party, this Article limits the 
right to damages to the extent that the aggrieved party has in part 
contributed to the harm. It would indeed be unjust for such a party to 
obtain full compensation for harm for which it has itself been partly 
responsible. 
2. Ways of contributing to the harm 
The contribution of the aggrieved party to the harm may consist 
either in its own conduct or in an event for which it bears the risk. The 
conduct may take the form of an act (e.g. it gave a carrier a mistaken 
address) or an omission (e.g. it failed to give all the necessary instruct-
tions to the constructor of the defective machinery). Most frequently 
such acts or omissions will result in the aggrieved party failing to 
perform one or another of its own contractual obligations; they may 
however equally consist in tortious conduct or non-performance of 
 
Damages 
Art. 7.4.7 
 
281 
another contract. The external events for which the aggrieved party 
bears the risk may, among others, be acts or omissions of persons for 
whom it is responsible such as its servants or agents.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, a franchisee bound by an “exclusivity” clause contained in 
the contract with B, acquires stock from C because B has required 
immediate payment despite the fact that the franchise agreement 
provides for payment at 90 days. B claims payment of the penalty 
stipulated for breach of the exclusivity clause. B will obtain only part 
of the sum due thereunder as it was B who provoked A’s non-
performance. 
2. 
A, a passenger on a liner effecting a luxury cruise, is injured 
when a lift fails to stop at the floor requested. B, the shipowner, is 
held liable for the consequences of A’s injury and seeks recourse 
against C, the company which had checked the lifts before the liner’s 
departure. It is proved that the accident would have been avoided if 
the floor had been better lit. Since this was B’s responsibility, B will 
not obtain full recovery from C. 
3. Apportionment of contribution to the harm 
The conduct of the aggrieved party or the external events as to which 
it bears the risk may have made it absolutely impossible for the non-
performing party to perform. If the requirements of Article 7.1.7 (Force 
majeure) are satisfied, the non-performing party is totally exonerated 
from liability. 
Otherwise, the exoneration will be partial, depending on the extent to 
which the aggrieved party contributed to the harm. The determination of 
each party’s contribution to the harm may well prove to be difficult and 
will to a large degree depend upon the exercise of judicial discretion. In 
order to give some guidance to the court this Article provides that the 
court shall have regard to the respective behaviour of the parties. The 
more serious a party’s failing, the greater will be its contribution to the 
harm. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. Since it was B who 
was the first not to observe the terms of the contract, B is deemed to 
have caused A’s failure to respect the exclusivity clause. B may only 
recover 25% of the amount stipulated in the penalty clause. 
Art. 7.4.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
282 
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2. Since the failings of 
B and C seem to be equivalent, B can only recover from C 50% of 
the compensation it had to pay A. 
4. Contribution to harm and mitigation of harm  
This Article must be read in conjunction with the following Article 
on mitigation of harm (see Article 7.4.8). While this Article is 
concerned with the conduct of the aggrieved party in regard to the cause 
of the initial harm, Article 7.4.8 relates to that party’s conduct 
subsequent thereto. 
ARTICLE  7.4.8 
(Mitigation of harm) 
(1) The non-performing party is not liable 
for harm suffered by the aggrieved party to the 
extent that the harm could have been reduced by 
the latter party’s taking reasonable steps. 
(2) The aggrieved party is entitled to 
recover any expenses reasonably incurred in 
attempting to reduce the harm. 
COMMENT 
1. Duty of aggrieved party to mitigate harm 
The purpose of this Article is to avoid the aggrieved party passively 
sitting back and waiting to be compensated for harm which it could have 
avoided or reduced. Any harm which the aggrieved party could have 
avoided by taking reasonable steps will not be compensated. 
Evidently, a party who has already suffered the consequences of non-
performance of the contract cannot be required in addition to take time-
consuming and costly measures. On the other hand, it would be 
unreasonable from the economic standpoint to permit an increase in 
harm which could have been reduced by the taking of reasonable steps. 
The steps to be taken by the aggrieved party may be directed either 
to limiting the extent of the harm, above all when there is a risk of it 
lasting for a long time if such steps are not taken (often they will consist 
in a replacement transaction: see Article 7.4.5), or to avoiding any 
increase in the initial harm.

Art. 7.4.8

I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
On 2 May, A requests B, a travel agency, to reserve a hotel 
room in city X for 1 June, at a cost of EUR 200. On 15 May, A 
learns that B has not made the reservation. A waits however until 25 
May before making a new reservation and can only find a room 
costing EUR 300, whereas accommodation could have been secured 
for EUR 250 if A had taken action already on 15 May. A can recover 
only EUR 50 from B. 
2. 
A, a company which has been entrusted by B with the building 
of a factory, suddenly stops work when the project is nearing 
completion. B looks for another company to finish the building of 
the factory but takes no steps to protect the buildings on the site the 
condition of which deteriorates as a result of bad weather. B cannot 
recover compensation for such deterioration as it is attributable to its 
failure to take interim protective measures. 
2. Reimbursement of expenses 
The reduction in damages to the extent that the aggrieved party has 
failed to take the necessary steps to mitigate the harm must not however 
cause loss to that party. The aggrieved party may therefore recover from 
the non-performing party the expenses incurred by it in mitigating the 
harm, provided that those expenses were reasonable in the 
circumstances (paragraph (2)). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2, except that B has the 
necessary work carried out to ensure the interim protection of the 
buildings. The cost of such work will be added to the damages due 
by A for non-performance of the contract on condition that those 
costs were reasonable. If they were not, they will be reduced. 
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that A takes a 
room costing EUR 500 in a luxury hotel. A may only recover the 50 
euro difference in respect of the room which A could have obtained 
for EUR 250. 
Art. 7.4.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
284 
ARTICLE  7.4.9 
(Interest for failure to pay money) 
(1) If a party does not pay a sum of money 
when it falls due the aggrieved party is entitled to 
interest upon that sum from the time when 
payment is due to the time of payment whether or 
not the non-payment is excused. 
(2) The rate of interest shall be the average 
bank short-term lending rate to prime borrowers 
prevailing for the currency of payment at the 
place for payment, or where no such rate exists at 
that place, then the same rate in the State of the 
currency of payment. In the absence of such a 
rate at either place the rate of interest shall be the 
appropriate rate fixed by the law of the State of 
the currency of payment. 
(3) The aggrieved party is entitled to 
additional damages if the non-payment caused it 
a greater harm. 
COMMENT 
1. Lump sum compensation for failure to pay a sum of money 
This Article reaffirms the widely accepted rule according to which 
the harm resulting from delay in the payment of a sum of money is 
subject to a special regime and is calculated by a lump sum 
corresponding to the interest accruing between the time when payment 
of the money was due and the time of actual payment. 
Interest is payable whenever the delay in payment is attributable to 
the non-performing party, and this as from the time when payment was 
due, without any need for the aggrieved party to give notice of the 
default. 
If the delay is the consequence of force majeure (e.g. the non-
performing party is prevented from obtaining the sum due by reason of 
the introduction of new exchange control regulations), interest will still 
be due not as damages but as compensation for the enrichment of the 
debtor as a result of the non-payment as the debtor continues to receive 
interest on the sum which it is prevented from paying. 
The harm is calculated as a lump sum. In other words, subject to 
paragraph (3) of this Article, the aggrieved party may not prove that it 
 
Damages 
Art. 7.4.9 
 
285 
could have invested the sum due at a higher rate of interest or the non-
performing party that the aggrieved party would have obtained interest 
at a rate lower than the average lending rate referred to in paragraph (2). 
The parties may of course agree in advance on a different rate of 
interest (which would in effect subject it to Article 7.4.13). 
2. Rate of interest 
Paragraph (2) of this Article fixes in the first instance as the rate of 
interest the average bank short-term lending rate to prime borrowers. 
This solution seems to be that best suited to the needs of international 
trade and most appropriate to ensure an adequate compensation of the 
harm sustained. The rate in question is the rate at which the aggrieved 
party will normally borrow the money which it has not received from 
the non-performing party. That normal rate is the average bank short-
term lending rate to prime borrowers prevailing at the place for payment 
for the currency of payment. 
No such rate may however exist for the currency of payment at the 
place for payment. In such cases, reference is made in the first instance 
to the average prime rate in the State of the currency of payment. For 
instance, if a loan is made in pounds sterling payable in country X and 
there is no rate for loans in pounds on country X financial market, 
reference will be made to the rate in the United Kingdom. 
In the absence of such a rate at either place, the rate of interest will 
be the “appropriate” rate fixed by the law of the State of the currency of 
payment. In most cases this will be the legal rate of interest and, as there 
may be more than one, that most appropriate for international 
transactions. If there is no legal rate of interest, the rate will be the most 
appropriate bank rate. 
3. Additional damages recoverable 
Interest is intended to compensate the harm normally sustained as a 
consequence of delay in payment of a sum of money. Such delay may 
however cause additional harm to the aggrieved party for which it may 
recover damages, always provided that it can prove the existence of 
such harm and that it meets the requirements of certainty and 
foreseeability (paragraph (3)). 
Art. 7.4.10 
UNIDROIT Principles 
286 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A concludes a contract with B, a specialised finance company, for a 
loan which will permit the renovation of its factory in country X. 
The loan specifically mentions the use of the funds. The money lent 
is transferred three months later than agreed. During that period the 
cost of the renovation has increased by ten percent. A is entitled to 
recover this additional sum from B. 
ARTICLE  7.4.10 
(Interest on damages) 
Unless 
otherwise 
agreed, 
interest 
on 
damages for non-performance of non-monetary 
obligations accrues as from the time of non-
performance. 
COMMENT 
This Article determines the time from which interest on damages 
accrues in cases of non-performance of obligations other than monetary 
obligations. In such cases, at the time of non-performance the amount of 
damages will usually not yet have been assessed in monetary terms. The 
assessment will only be made after the occurrence of the harm, either by 
agreement between the parties or by the court.  
This Article fixes as the starting point for the accrual of interest the 
date of the occurrence of the harm. This solution is that best suited to 
international trade where it is not the practice for businesspersons to 
leave their money idle. In effect, the aggrieved party’s assets are 
diminished as from the occurrence of the harm whereas the non-
performing party, for as long as the damages are not paid, continues to 
enjoy the benefit of the interest on the sum which it will have to pay. It 
is only natural that this gain passes to the aggrieved party. 
However, when making the final assessment of the harm, regard is to 
be had to the fact that damages are awarded as from the date of the 
harm, so as to avoid double compensation, for instance when a currency 
depreciates in value. 
This Article takes no stand on the question of compound interest, 
which in some national laws is subject to rules of public policy limiting 
compound interest with a view to protecting the non-performing party.

ARTICLE  7.4.11 
(Manner of monetary redress) 
(1) Damages are to be paid in a lump sum. 
However, they may be payable in instalments 
where the nature of the harm makes this 
appropriate. 
(2) Damages to be paid in instalments may 
be indexed. 
COMMENT 
1. Lump sum or instalments 
Although this Article does not impose a fixed rule as to the manner 
in which damages are to be paid, the payment of damages as a lump 
sum is in general considered to be the mode of payment best suited to 
international trade. There are however situations in which payment by 
instalments will be more appropriate, having regard to the nature of the 
harm, for instance when the harm is on-going. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, a consultant, is retained by B for the purpose of checking the 
safety of its factories. A is killed when travelling by helicopter to one 
of B’s factories, for which accident B is held responsible. A leaves 
two children aged twelve and eight. So as to compensate for the loss 
of the maintenance of the family, a monthly allowance will be 
payable to the children until they reach the age of majority. 
2. 
A, a consultant in safety matters, is recruited by B for a three 
year period. The remuneration is fixed at 0.5% of the production. A 
is wrongfully dismissed after six months. It may be appropriate that 
B be ordered to pay A monthly a sum corresponding to the agreed 
salary until A has found new employment or, at the most, for thirty 
months. 
2. Indexation 
Paragraph (2) of this Article contemplates the possibility of 
indexation of damages to be paid in instalments so as to avoid the 
complex mechanism of a review of the original judgment in order to 
take account of inflation. Indexation may however be prohibited by the 
law of the forum. 
Art. 7.4.12

The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. The monthly 
allowance may be adjusted in accordance with the cost of living 
index applicable where the children live. 
ARTICLE  7.4.12 
(Currency in which to assess damages) 
Damages are to be assessed either in the 
currency in which the monetary obligation was 
expressed or in the currency in which the harm 
was suffered, whichever is more appropriate. 
COMMENT 
The harm resulting from the non-performance of an international 
contract may occur in different places and the question therefore arises 
of the currency in which it is to be assessed. This question is dealt with 
by this Article and should be kept distinct from that of the currency of 
payment of the damages addressed in Article 6.1.9. 
The Article offers a choice between the currency in which the 
monetary obligation was expressed and that in which the harm was 
suffered, whichever is more appropriate in the circumstances. 
While the first alternative calls for no particular comment, the second 
takes account of the fact that the aggrieved party may have incurred 
expenses in a particular currency to repair damage which it has 
sustained. In such a case it should be entitled to claim damages in that 
currency even if it is not the currency of the contract. Another currency 
which may be considered the most appropriate is that in which the profit 
would have been made. 
The choice is left to the aggrieved party, provided that the principle 
of full compensation is respected. 
Finally, it may be noted that in the absence of any indication to the 
contrary, a party is entitled to interest and to liquidated damages and 
penalties in the same currency as that in which the main obligation is 
expressed.

Art. 7.4.13 
 
289 
ARTICLE  7.4.13 
(Agreed payment for non-performance) 
(1) Where the contract provides that a 
party who does not perform is to pay a specified 
sum to the aggrieved party for such non-
performance, the aggrieved party is entitled to 
that sum irrespective of its actual harm. 
(2) However, notwithstanding any agree-
ment to the contrary the specified sum may be 
reduced to a reasonable amount where it is 
grossly excessive in relation to the harm resulting 
from the non-performance and to the other 
circumstances. 
COMMENT 
1. Agreed payment for non-performance defined 
This Article gives an intentionally broad definition of agreements to 
pay a specified sum in case of non-performance, whether such 
agreements be intended to facilitate the recovery of damages (liquidated 
damages according to the common law) or to operate as a deterrent 
against non-performance (penalty clauses proper), or both. 
2. Agreed payment for non-performance in principle valid 
National laws vary considerably with respect to the validity of the 
type of clauses in question, ranging from their acceptance in the civil 
law countries, with or without the possibility of judicial review of 
particularly onerous clauses, to the outright rejection in common law 
systems of clauses intended specifically to operate as a deterrent against 
non-performance, i.e. penalty clauses. 
In view of their frequency in international contract practice, 
paragraph (1) of this Article in principle acknowledges the validity of 
any clauses providing that a party who does not perform is to pay a 
specified sum to the aggrieved party for such non-performance, with the 
consequence that the latter is entitled to the agreed sum irrespective of 
the harm actually suffered by it. The non-performing party may not 
allege that the aggrieved party sustained less harm or none at all. 
Art. 7.4.13 
UNIDROIT Principles 
290 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a former international football player from country X, is 
recruited for three years to train the players of B, a football team 
from country Y, at a monthly salary of AUD 10,000. Provision is 
made for a severance allowance of AUD 200,000 in the event of 
unjustified dismissal. A is dismissed without any justification after 
six months. A is entitled to the agreed sum, even though A was 
immediately recruited by another team at double the salary received 
from B. 
Normally, the non-performance must be one for which the non-
performing party is liable, since it is difficult to conceive a clause 
providing for the payment of an agreed sum in case of non-performance 
operating in a force majeure situation. Exceptionally, however, such a 
clause may be intended by the parties also to cover non-performance for 
which the non-performing party is not liable. 
In the case of partial non-performance, the amount may, unless 
otherwise agreed by the parties, be reduced in proportion. 
3. Agreed sum may be reduced 
In order to prevent the possibility of abuse to which such clauses 
may give rise, paragraph (2) of this Article permits the reduction of the 
agreed sum if it is grossly excessive “in relation to the harm resulting 
from the non-performance and to the other circumstances”. The same 
paragraph makes it clear that the parties may under no circumstances 
exclude such a possibility of reduction.  
The agreed sum may only be reduced, but not entirely disregarded as 
would be the case were the judge, notwithstanding the agreement of the 
parties, to award damages corresponding to the exact amount of the 
harm. It may not be increased, at least under this Article, where the 
agreed sum is lower than the harm actually sustained (see however 
Comment 4 on Article 7.1.6). It is moreover necessary that the amount 
agreed be “grossly excessive”, i.e. that it would clearly appear to be so 
to any reasonable person. Regard should in particular be had to the 
relationship between the sum agreed and the harm actually sustained. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A enters into a contract with B for the purchase of machinery 
which provides for payment in five instalments of EUR 50,000 each. 
The contract contains a clause allowing immediate termination in the 
event of non-payment by A of one instalment, and authorises B to 
keep the sums already paid and to recover future instalments as 
damages. A fails to pay the third instalment. B keeps the EUR 
100,000 already paid and claims, in addition to the return of the 
 
Damages 
Art. 7.4.13 
 
291 
machinery, the EUR 150,000 representing the three outstanding 
instalments. The court will reduce the amount since A’s non-
performance would result in a grossly excessive benefit for B. 
4. Agreed payment for non-performance to be distinguished from 
forfeiture and other similar clauses 
The type of clauses dealt with in this Article must be distinguished 
from forfeiture and other similar clauses which permit a party to 
withdraw from a contract either by paying a certain sum or by losing a 
deposit already made. On the other hand a clause according to which the 
aggrieved party may retain sums already paid as part of the price falls 
within the scope of this Article. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
3. 
A undertakes to sell real estate to B for EUR 450,000. B must 
exercise the option to purchase within three months and must pay a 
deposit of EUR 25,000, which A is entitled to retain if B does not 
exercise the option. Since this is not an agreed payment for non-
performance it does not fall under this Article and the sum cannot be 
reduced thereunder even if grossly excessive in the circumstances. 
4. 
A enters into a contract with B for the lease of a machine. The 
contract provides that in the event of A’s failure to pay one single 
rental the contract will be terminated and that the sums already paid 
will be retained by B as damages. The clause falls under this Article 
and the agreed amount may be subject to reduction.

SET-OFF 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  8.1 
(Conditions of set-off) 
(1) Where two parties owe each other 
money or other performances of the same kind, 
either of them (“the first party”) may set off its 
obligation against that of its obligee (“the other 
party”) if at the time of set-off, 
(a) the first party is entitled to perform its 
obligation; 
(b) the other party’s obligation is ascer-
tained as to its existence and amount and 
performance is due. 
(2) If the obligations of both parties arise 
from the same contract, the first party may also 
set off its obligation against an obligation of the 
other party which is not ascertained as to its 
existence or to its amount.  
COMMENT 
1. Use of set-off 
Under the Principles, when two parties owe each other an obligation 
arising from a contract or any cause of action, each party may set off its 
obligation against the obligation of the other party. By mutual 
deduction, both obligations are discharged up to the amount of the lesser 
obligation (see Article 8.5). Set-off avoids the need for each party to 
perform its obligation separately. 
The obligor from whom payment is asked, and who sets off its own 
obligation, is called “the first party”. The obligee who first asks its 
obligor for payment and against whom the right of set-off is exercised, 
is called “the other party”. 
 
Set-off 
Art. 8.1 
 
293 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A, a sea carrier, has carried goods belonging to B from country 
X to country Y. A asks B for EUR 10,000 as payment for the 
carriage. B, who had previously become an obligee of A for an 
amount of EUR 10,000 as compensation for harm to other goods 
carried, may set off its own obligation to pay A EUR 10,000 against 
A’s obligation to pay it EUR 10,000. If it does so, neither A nor B 
will remain the other’s obligor. 
2. 
A sells B a plot of land for the price of AUD 100,000. 
Subsequently B, who is a contractor, builds a house for A. The price 
of the construction is AUD 200,000. When A asks for the payment 
of the land, B may set off the price of the construction. The 
obligation of B to pay A AUD 100,000 is totally discharged, but A 
remains B’s obligor for AUD 100,000.  
For a party to be allowed to set off its own obligation against the 
obligation of the other party the conditions laid down in this Article 
must be satisfied. 
2. Obligation owed to each other 
A first condition is that each party is the obligor and the obligee of 
the other (paragraph (1), opening sentence). To be noted is that the 
parties must be so in the same capacity. Thus, set-off is not possible if 
the first party has an obligation to the other party in its own name but is 
the obligee of the other party in another capacity, for example as a 
trustee or as the absolute owner of a company. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Company A sells company B machinery for 600,000 Japanese 
Yen (JPY). B, which is in business with company C, a subsidiary of 
A, sells C products for JPY 500,000. When A asks B to pay the sales 
price of the machinery, B cannot set off its obligation for the sale of 
the products to C, even if the capital of C is totally subscribed by A, 
as C is an independent entity. A and B are not obligor and obligee of 
each other. 
The condition that the obligations must be owed to each other may 
give rise to a problem where the other party has assigned the obligation 
owed to it by the first party to a third party. The first party may 
nonetheless set off its obligation against the other party’s obligation if 
the right of set-off existed against the assignor’s obligation before the 
assignment was notified to the obligor (see Article 9.1.13).  
Art. 8.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
294 
3. Obligations of the same kind 
Both obligations must be of the same kind (paragraph (1), opening 
sentence). In some legal systems obligations have to be “fungible”. A 
monetary obligation may be set off only against a monetary obligation. 
A delivery of grain may be set off only against a delivery of grain of the 
same kind.  
The concept of “obligations of the same kind” is broader than that of 
“fungible obligations”. Performances of non-monetary obligations may be 
of the same kind while at the same time not being fungible. Two 
obligations to deliver wine of the same vineyard but not of the same year 
may be obligations of the same kind, but would not be fungible. Cash and 
securities are not performances of the same kind in the sense of this 
Article. Nevertheless, as is the case with different foreign currencies, set-
off may be exercised if the securities are easily convertible and if there is 
no agreement to the effect that only the payment of specified cash or 
securities is possible. Whether or not obligations are of the same kind may 
depend on commercial practices or special trade rules.  
A personal obligation cannot be of the same kind as another type of 
obligation. Set-off is thus not available if one of the obligations is of a 
personal nature. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
4. 
A, a crude oil producer, contracts to deliver 1,500 tonnes of crude 
oil by pipe-line every month to B in country X. B, in turn, must each 
week transfer 1,000 tonnes of crude oil by road. The crude oil 
produced by A and the crude oil delivered by B do not have the same 
origin and are not totally similar, but as their use could be identical, the 
two obligations relating to the crude oil can be said to be of the same 
kind, and if A and B are obligor and obligee for the delivery of some 
quantity of crude oil, set-off will be available. 
5. 
A holds 100 ordinary shares of the company C. Shareholder B 
of the same company holds 120 redeemable preferred shares. They 
are obligee and obligor of each other, and in an earlier contract it was 
provided that payment would be possible by means of shares of 
equal value. Since the shares held by A and the shares held by B are 
not of the same kind, set-off cannot be exercised. 
4. First party’s obligation performable  
The first party must have the right to perform its obligation 
(paragraph (1)(a)). It cannot impose on the other party a performance 
which either has not yet been ascertained, or is not yet due. 
 
Set-off 
Art. 8.1

I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
6. 
A has sold ten trucks to B for USD 1,000,000. B must pay for 
the trucks before 30 September. B wishes to set off an obligation it 
has towards A arising from a loan to A, repayment of which is due 
on 30 November. Before this date B may not set off its obligation 
towards A, as it cannot pay A before 30 November. B’s obligation to 
A is not yet due. 
7. 
A owes B EUR 200,000 for the repayment of a loan. The 
repayment must take place on 30 January. B is obliged to pay A for a 
claim for damages of EUR 140,000, under a judgment handed down 
on 25 January. A asks B to pay on 9 February. B, whose obligation 
can be performed, is allowed to set off its obligation against A’s 
obligation. 
8. 
A has sold B 10,000 bottles of wine, the price of which must be 
paid at the latest on 30 October. B is also A’s obligee and A’s 
obligation is already due. B may set off its own obligation against 
A’s obligation on 10 October even if the latest date B’s obligation 
should be paid is 30 October, because A is bound to accept a 
payment before such date.  
5. Other party’s obligation ascertained  
Set-off may be exercised only when the other party’s obligation is 
ascertained both as to its existence and as to its amount (paragraph 
(1)(b)). 
The existence of an obligation is ascertained when the obligation 
itself cannot be contested, for example, when it is based on a valid and 
executed contract or a final judgment or award which is not subject to 
review. 
Conversely, an obligation to pay damages is not ascertained when 
the obligation may be contested by the other party. 
Even if the existence of the other party’s obligation is not contested, 
it is not possible to exercise set-off if the obligation is not ascertained as 
to its amount. If the existence of the harm is not disputed, but the 
amount of the compensation has not been fixed, set-off will not be 
available. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
9. 
A judgment requires A to pay B 200,000 Chinese Yuan 
Renminbi (CNY), for breach of contract. B is in turn A’s obligor for 
the repayment of a loan of CNY 240,000, repayment of which is 
already due. A asks B to pay the CNY 240,000. B may set off its 
obligation against A’s obligation arising from the judgment. 
Art. 8.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
296 
10. A sells B a yacht for EUR 300,000. A is liable to B for tort. The 
harm is not contested, but the amount of damages has not yet been 
fixed. A will not be permitted to set off its own obligation, as A’s 
obligation has not been ascertained. 
The Principles do not deal with the impact of insolvency proceedings 
on the right to exercise set-off, which is therefore to be determined by 
the applicable law. Most domestic laws grant the first party the right to 
exercise set-off even after the other party has become involved in 
insolvency proceedings, thereby derogating from the principle of the 
equality of the creditors in insolvency proceedings.  
6. Other party’s obligation due 
The other party’s obligation must furthermore be due (paragraph 
(1)(b)). An obligation is due when the obligee has the right to request 
performance by the obligor, and the obligor has no available defence 
against that request. A defence will, for example, be available if the time 
of payment has not yet arrived. As a natural or moral obligation is not 
enforceable, the first party may not set off its obligations against such an 
obligation owed by the other party. The enforceability or non-
enforceability of an obligation may depend on the otherwise applicable 
law. Consequently, in some cases the possibility to exercise the right of 
set-off may depend on the otherwise applicable law. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
11. By a final judgment of 10 April, A was ordered to pay B USD 
20,000 for the sale of cotton. A, who is B’s obligee for the 
repayment of a loan of USD 12,000 which was enforceable as from 
10 January, may set off its own obligation against B’s obligation. B, 
whose obligation is ascertained and due cannot contest the set-off 
exercised by A. 
Since the expiration of the limitation periods prevents the enforce-
ment of the obligation but does not extinguish the right itself, the first 
party who is not allowed to enforce the time-barred obligation may 
nonetheless set off that time-barred obligation (see Article 10.10). 
7. Set-off of obligations arising from the same contract 
Set-off is a convenient means of discharging obligations at once and 
at the same time. Therefore, if the two obligations arise from the same 
contract, the conditions of set-off are modified.  
If the obligations of the two parties arise from the same contract, the 
first party is allowed to set off its own obligation against an obligation 
of the other party even where that other party’s obligation is not 
 
Set-off 
Art. 8.1 
 
297 
ascertained as to its existence or to its amount (paragraph (2)). Thus, for 
instance, an obligation to pay damages may be ascertained as to its 
existence but not as to its amount. If the minimum amount payable 
cannot be contested, the first party may set off its own obligation up to 
that minimum amount, even if the total amount of the other party’s 
obligation is unknown. 
Even though one of the obligations is contested, the right to set-off 
can be exercised because all the relevant obligations capable of being 
set off arise from the same contract and can therefore be easily 
identified. This could be useful to parties in a business relationship to 
facilitate quick settlements of claims. Judicial intervention may however 
be necessary to determine whether the conditions of set-off are in fact 
satisfied. In international commerce, the obligations of the two parties 
may frequently arise from the same contract. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
12. A carries turkeys for B from country X to country Y. The 
carriage charge is 35,000 Russian Roubles (RUB). During the 
carriage one hundred turkeys die due to the fault of the carrier which 
it acknowledges. A asks B for the payment of the carriage. B may set 
off the obligation to pay for the harm caused by the loss of the 
turkeys against A’s obligation. Although the amount of the damages 
is not ascertained, it would be easy to estimate the damages and 
determine if the conditions for set off are satisfied as the two 
obligations arise from the same contract. 
13. A, a carrier, accepts to carry a piano for pianist B from country 
X to country Y. A provision of the contract expressly provides that 
delay penalties are to be paid if the piano is not delivered at the 
concert hall five days before the date of the concert. The piano is 
delivered at the place of destination only two days before the date of 
the concert. A asks for the payment of the carriage. B may set off its 
claim for the agreed delay penalties against A’s claim even if A 
contests the amount of the penalties owed for the delay. 
8. Set-off by agreement 
Even if the conditions of this Article are not met, the parties may 
achieve the effects of set-off by agreement. Likewise, parties may agree 
that their mutual obligations are set off automatically either at a 
Art. 8.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
298 
specific date or periodically. Also, more than two parties may agree that 
their respective obligations shall be discharged, for example by netting. 
ARTICLE  8.2 
(Foreign currency set-off) 
Where the obligations are to pay money in 
different currencies, the right of set-off may be 
exercised, provided that both currencies are 
freely convertible and the parties have not agreed 
that the first party shall pay only in a specified 
currency. 
COMMENT 
1. Convertible currencies 
Payments in different currencies are not performances of the same 
kind as required by Article 8.1. However, if the payments are to be 
made in currencies that are both convertible, set-off may nevertheless be 
exercised. According to Article 6.1.9, if there is no agreement to the 
contrary, payment may be made by the obligor in the currency of the 
place for payment, if this currency is convertible. On the contrary, since 
the relative value of a currency that is not freely convertible cannot be 
readily ascertained for the purpose of set-off, set-off cannot be used to 
impose payment in such a currency on the other party. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A, a wine producer in country X, sells 5,000 bottles of wine for 
USD 200,000 to B, a cork producer. B sells 100,000 corks to A for 
the price of 100,000 livros, which is the currency of the country 
where corks are produced and which is not convertible. A asks B for 
payment of the USD 200,000. B may not set off the 100,000 livros 
against the USD 200,000. 
2. Currency specified by contract 
If a contract expressly requires a party to pay in a specified currency, 
and if the other party has to perform its own obligation in a currency 
different from that currency, it will not be able to set off its own 
obligation against the other party’s obligation.

A sells B products for USD 100,000. The sales contract expressly 
provides that the price is to be paid by the buyer in US dollars. B, an 
Asian carrier, is A’s obligee for an unpaid invoice for carriage charges 
which must be paid in Korean Won. A requires payment of the USD 
100,000. B, who contractually is obliged to pay the price of the 
products in US dollars, is not allowed to set off its obligation against 
the obligation of A to pay the carriage charges. 
ARTICLE  8.3 
(Set-off by notice) 
The right of set-off is exercised by notice to 
the other party. 
COMMENT 
The right of set-off is exercised by notice to the other party. It does 
not operate automatically or by declaration of the court. The first party 
must inform the other party that it will discharge its own obligation by 
set-off. Notice must not be conditional. 
To be effective, notice must be sent after the conditions for set-off 
are fulfilled.  
Notice may be given by any means appropriate to the circumstances 
and is effective when it reaches the person to whom it is given (see 
Article 1.10). 
ARTICLE  8.4 
(Content of notice) 
(1) The notice must specify the obligations 
to which it relates. 
(2) If the notice does not specify the 
obligation against which set-off is exercised, the 
other party may, within a reasonable time, 
declare to the first party the obligation to which 
set-off relates. If no such declaration is made, the 
set-off 
will 
relate 
to 
all 
the 
obligations 
proportionally.  
Art. 8.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
300 
COMMENT 
According to paragraph (1), the notice must specify the obligations 
of both parties that are to be set off. The other party, receiving the 
notice, must know the grounds for set-off and the amount of set-off. 
1. Declaration by the other party 
If the first party has two or more obligations against the other party, 
and if the first party has not specified the obligations it wants to be paid 
by set-off, the other party may freely choose which of the first party’s 
obligations it wants to be discharged (paragraph (2), first part). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
1. 
A regularly sells B cloth. On 30 December B asks A for the 
payment of USD 50,000 that A owes it. At that date B owes A the 
payment of the price relating to three different sales contracts, i.e. 
USD 40,000, USD 35,000 and USD 45,000 respectively. If A wants to 
set off B’s obligation, it has to indicate in the notice which of the three 
obligations owed by B it wants to set off. If A does not indicate in the 
notice which obligation owed by B it wants to set off, B may in a 
reasonable time indicate to A that its obligation of USD 45,000 will be 
totally discharged by set off and that the obligation of USD 35,000 
will be discharged up to USD 5,000. After set-off has been applied, B 
remains the obligor of A for USD 70,000. 
2. Absence of declaration 
If the notice does not specify the obligations that the first party wants 
to set off, and if the other party does not make any declaration as to 
which obligation set-off relates within a reasonable time, all the 
obligations of the other party will be discharged by set-off 
proportionally, up to the value of the first party’s obligation (paragraph 
(2), second part). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B does 
not declare to which obligation set-off relates. In the absence of such 
a declaration, set-off will discharge the obligation of USD 40,000 of 
the first contract up to USD 16,670; the obligation of USD 35,000 of 
the second contract up to USD 14,580 and the obligation of USD 
45,000 of the third contract up to USD 18,750.

ARTICLE  8.5 
(Effect of set-off) 
(1) Set-off discharges the obligations. 
(2) If obligations differ in amount, set-off 
discharges the obligations up to the amount of the 
lesser obligation. 
(3) Set-off takes effect as from the time of 
notice. 
COMMENT  
1. Discharge by set-off 
If the conditions of set-off specified in Article 8.1 are satisfied, the 
obligations of both parties are discharged to the extent of the set-off, as 
if two reciprocal payments had been made. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A owes USD 100,000 to B and B owes USD 100,000 to A. B 
asks for the payment of its obligation. A by notice declares to B that 
it sets off its own obligation. After set-off takes effect, the two 
obligations are discharged. 
If the two obligations differ in their amount, set-off will discharge 
the obligations, but only up to the amount of the lesser obligation.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
B owes USD 100,000 to A, who in turn owes B USD 70,000. A 
asks for the payment of the USD 100,000 it is owed, B declares that 
it wants to set off A’s obligation of USD 70,000. If the conditions for 
set-off are met, A is no longer the obligor of B, as its obligation has 
been entirely discharged, but A is still the obligee of B for USD 
30,000, corresponding to the part of the obligation not paid by set-
off. 
2. Set-off effective at the time of notice 
The obligations are discharged at the time of notice if at that time the 
conditions required for set-off are fulfilled. Set-off does not operate 
retroactively. It has prospective effect only. 
The date of effectiveness of set-off is consistent with the necessity to 
declare set-off by notice, and in practice the date when set-off is 
effective will be easy to know. 
Art. 8.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
302 
The situation has to be evaluated as if both obligations were paid at 
the time of notice. Two consequences derive from this rule. Firstly, 
interest on the obligations runs until the time of notice. A party who 
may and wants to set off its obligation, must declare set-off as soon as 
possible if it wishes to stop the accrual of interest. Secondly, if an undue 
payment has been made after set-off has been declared, restitution will 
take place, as the payment has no legal grounds. If the payment had 
been made before the notice, it is an effective payment and restitution 
cannot be required. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
A owes B USD 100,000 dollars for goods sold by B. A’s 
obligation is ascertained and payment is due on 20 November. By a 
judgement dated 30 November, B is ordered to pay A USD 80,000 in 
damages. The obligation to pay USD 80,000 is due and ascertained 
at the date of the judgement, i.e. on 30 November. Set-off is 
exercised by A by notice on 10 December. The set-off will take 
place at the time of notice as all the conditions required have been 
satisfied before this date. The two obligations are discharged up to 
the amount of the lesser obligation. A will remain the obligee of B 
for USD 20,000. After 10 December, interest no longer accrues, 
except on the amount of USD 20,000. 
At the time when the conditions for set-off are satisfied and notice 
has been given, not only are the principal obligations discharged but 
also related rights, e.g. rights securing an obligation, are discharged 
accordingly. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
A, a banker, had lent architect B EUR 100,000 and has obtained 
a personal security for the payment from B’s wife. B is the obligee of 
A for EUR 120,000, which is money that B holds on its account in A’s 
bank. A asks B for the payment of the EUR 100,000. B declares set-off 
by notice on 12 December. The conditions required for A’s obligation 
and B’s obligation were fulfilled on 10 December. At the date of 
notice on 12 December, A’s and B’s obligations are discharged, as is 
the personal security given by B’s wife.

ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS, TRANSFER OF 
OBLIGATIONS, ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS 
 
 
 
SECTION  1: ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS 
ARTICLE  9.1.1 
(Definitions) 
“Assignment of a right” means the transfer 
by agreement from one person (the “assignor”) to 
another person (the “assignee”), including transfer 
by way of security, of the assignor’s right to 
payment of a monetary sum or other performance 
from a third person (“the obligor”). 
COMMENT  
In many circumstances an obligee entitled to the payment of a 
monetary sum or to another performance from an obligor may find it 
useful to assign its right to another person. For instance, an assignment 
to a bank is a common way to finance the credit granted to a customer. 
The Articles of the present Section cover the assignment of rights as 
defined in this Article.  
1. Transfer by agreement 
Only transfers by agreement are concerned, as opposed to situations 
in which the applicable law may provide for legal transfers of certain 
rights (such as, in certain jurisdictions, the transfer of a seller’s rights 
against an insurer to the purchaser of an insured building, or the 
automatic transfer of rights in the case of the merger of companies (see 
Article 9.1.2(b)). 
The definition equally does not cover unilateral transfers, which in 
certain jurisdictions may take place without the assignee’s participation.

2. Right to payment of a monetary sum or to other performance 
On the other hand, the definition is not restricted to the assignment of 
rights to the payment of a monetary sum. It also covers rights to other 
kinds of performance, such as the rendering of a service. Nor are the 
assignable rights limited to rights of a contractual nature. Claims 
deriving from non-contractual claims or based on a judgment, for 
instance, can be governed by the present Section, subject to Article 1.4. 
Future rights may also be transferred under the conditions of Article 
9.1.5. 
3. Notion of “transfer” 
The “transfer” of the right means that it leaves the assignor’s assets 
to become part of those of the assignee. The definition also covers 
transfers for security purposes. 
4. Third party rights 
Transfers from the assets of the assignor to those of the assignee 
remain subject to third party rights. Different third persons can be 
affected by the assignment of a right between an assignor and an 
assignee, such as, first and foremost, the obligor, but also the assignor’s 
creditors and successive assignees. Third party rights are covered in part 
by other provisions of this Section (see Articles 9.1.10 and 9.1.11 
concerning the obligor and successive assignees). They may in some 
instances be governed by mandatory rules of the otherwise applicable 
law (e.g. the law of bankruptcy).  
ARTICLE  9.1.2  
(Exclusions) 
This Section does not apply to transfers 
made under the special rules governing the 
transfers: 
(a)  of instruments such as negotiable 
instruments, documents of title or financial 
instruments, or 
(b) of rights in the course of transferring a 
business.  
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.2 
 
305 
COMMENT  
Some types of assignment of rights are normally subject to very 
specific rules under the applicable law, and are therefore not governed 
by this Section. 
1. Transfer of instruments governed by special rules 
The transfer of certain types of instrument governed by special rules 
are outside the scope of this Section. This applies for instance to 
negotiable instruments, such as bills of exchange, that are usually 
transferred by endorsement or delivery of the document, and which are 
subject to further distinct rules, e.g. concerning defences that would 
have been available to the transferor. This exclusion also applies to 
documents of title, such as bills of lading or warehouse receipts, and 
financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. The transfer of such 
instruments are all normally subject to specific rules. 
This does not exclude the possibility that such rights, in certain 
jurisdictions, could also be transferred by a normal assignment, which 
would then be subject to this Section. 
2. Transfer of a business 
Another exclusion is assignment made in the course of transferring a 
business under special rules governing such transfers, as may happen in 
the case of the merger of companies. The applicable law often provides 
for mechanisms that cause all rights and obligations, under certain 
conditions, to be transferred in their entirety by operation of law.  
Article 9.1.2(b) does not prevent this Section from applying when 
certain rights pertaining to the transferred business are assigned 
individually. On the contrary, the mere transfer of shares in a company 
may fall under Article 9.1.2(a) and therefore not be covered by this 
Section. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Company A is transferred to company B. If the otherwise 
applicable law provides that all rights pertaining to the former 
company are automatically transferred to the latter, the Principles do 
not apply.  
2. 
The initial facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but B is not 
interested in taking over a specific claim against customer X, and 
prefers that right to be assigned to company C. This particular 
transfer is subject to the Principles. 
Art. 9.1.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
306 
ARTICLE  9.1.3  
(Assignability of non-monetary rights) 
A right to non-monetary performance may 
be assigned only if the assignment does not render 
the obligation significantly more burdensome. 
COMMENT 
The assignment of a right does not in principle affect the obligor’s 
rights and obligations. However, to a certain extent the fact that 
performance is now due to another obligee can modify the conditions 
under which the obligation is to be performed. The place of performance 
may be different. The change of obligee may in itself render the 
obligation more burdensome. 
Article 9.1.8 entitles the obligor to be compensated by the assignor 
or the assignee for any additional costs caused by the assignment. That 
provision should be sufficient to take care of the problem in the case of 
the assignment of monetary obligations. However, when the assigned 
right concerns a non-monetary performance, the remedy may not always 
be sufficient. This Article excludes the possibility of assigning such 
rights when the transfer would render the obligation significantly more 
burdensome for the obligor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Company X has undertaken to provide the security service 
aimed at preventing theft in warehouses used by company A for the 
storage of wood. The premises are sold to company B, which intends 
to apply them to the same use. Nothing in this provision prevents A 
from assigning to B its right to the security services provided by X. 
2. 
The initial facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but B intends 
to use the warehouses for the storage of electronic equipment. A’s 
right to the security services provided by X may not be assigned to 
B: such services would become significantly more burdensome since 
the security risks are obviously much higher with electronic 
equipment than with the storage of wood. 
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.4 
 
307 
ARTICLE  9.1.4  
(Partial assignment) 
(1) A right to the payment of a monetary 
sum may be assigned partially.  
(2) A right to other performance may be 
assigned partially only if it is divisible, and the 
assignment does not render the obligation signi-
ficantly more burdensome. 
COMMENT 
1. Economic interest 
The partial assignment of a right may serve different economic 
purposes. A contractor may for instance want to assign part of its right 
to payment from a customer to a financing institution and keep the rest 
for itself. Or it may want to assign the other part to a supplier of raw 
materials.  
Permitting partial assignment may however affect the principle that 
the assignment should not worsen the obligor’s situation. If the right is 
split, the obligor will have to perform in several parts, which could 
entail extra costs. 
2.  Monetary and non-monetary rights 
The obligor’s burden of having to make two or several monetary 
payments instead of one is not in itself deemed to be excessive, and 
partial assignments of monetary rights are therefore permitted in 
principle (paragraph (1)).  
Another rule prevails for the assignment of non-monetary rights, 
where the validity of the partial assignment is made dependent on two 
cumulative conditions: the divisibility of the performance due and the 
degree of additional burden the partial assignment may place on the 
obligor. Article 9.1.3 already excludes the possibility to assign non-
monetary rights in their entirety if the assignment would render the 
obligation significantly more burdensome. Paragraph (2) applies the 
same rule to the partial assignment of such rights. 
In any event, additional costs borne by the obligor as a result of 
having to perform in several parts must be compensated under 
Article 9.1.8. 
Art. 9.1.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
308 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Buyer X is due to pay a price of USD 1,000,000 to seller A on 
31 October. A urgently needs USD 600,000 and assigns a 
corresponding part of its right to bank B. Notice of the partial 
assignment is given to X. On 31 October, both A and B claim 
payment of their respective parts. X must pay A USD 400,000 and B 
USD 600,000.  
2. 
Metal company X is to deliver 1,000 tons of steel to carmaker 
A on 31 October. Due to a decrease in sales, A estimates that it will 
not need that much steel at that time, and assigns the right to delivery 
of up to 300 tons to carmaker B. Notice of the partial assignment is 
given to X. On 31 October both A and B claim delivery of their 
respective quantities. X must deliver 700 tons to A and 300 tons to 
B. 
3. 
Tax consultant X has promised to spend 30 days in examining 
the accounts of company A in order to determine the proper policy to 
be followed in the light of new tax regulations. A subsequently 
regrets this arrangement, in consideration of the level of the fees to 
be paid. It proposes to assign 15 of the days to company B. X can 
argue against such a partial assignment on the grounds that 
performance of tasks of that nature is not divisible. It can also argue 
that the accounts of B are of a significantly more complex nature 
than those of A. 
ARTICLE  9.1.5  
(Future rights) 
A future right is deemed to be transferred 
at the time of the agreement, provided the right, 
when it comes into existence, can be identified as 
the right to which the assignment relates. 
COMMENT 
1.  Economic interest 
For the purposes of this Section, a future right is a right that will or 
might come into existence in the future (as opposed to a present right to 
a performance due in the future). Examples of future rights are rights 
that a bank may have against a customer who might be granted a credit 
line in the future, or that a company may have against another 
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.6 
 
309 
company on the basis of a contract which might be concluded in the 
future. The assignment of such future rights can be highly significant 
economically. 
2.  Determinability 
According to this Article a future right can be assigned on condition 
that it can be determined as the right to which the assignment relates 
when it comes into existence. The reason for this is the need to avoid the 
difficulties that might be caused by a transfer of future rights that are 
described in vague and too broad general terms.  
3. Retroactive effect 
This Article also provides that the assignment of future rights is 
effective with retroactivity between the assignor and the assignee. When 
the right comes into existence, the transfer is considered to have taken 
place at the time of the assignment agreement.  
As regards third parties, it will be recalled that their rights may in 
some instances be governed by mandatory rules of the otherwise 
applicable law (e.g. the law of bankruptcy). However, third party rights 
are partly covered by other provisions of this Section, including the 
consequences of notices specified in Articles 9.1.10 and 9.1.11.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
In order to finance new investments, company A assigns the 
royalties to be earned from future licences of a certain technology to 
lending institution B. Six months later, A licenses that technology to 
company X. The royalties due are considered to have been assigned 
to B from the date of the assignment agreement, provided the 
royalties can be related to this agreement. 
ARTICLE  9.1.6  
(Rights assigned without individual specification) 
A number of rights may be assigned 
without individual specification, provided such 
rights can be identified as rights to which the 
assignment relates at the time of the assignment 
or when they come into existence. 
Art. 9.1.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
310 
COMMENT 
Rights are often assigned as a bundle or in bulk. A company may for 
instance assign all its receivables to a factoring company. In practice it 
would be excessively burdensome to require individual specification of 
each assigned right, but the global identification of the rights assigned as 
a bundle must be such as to permit the recognition of each right 
concerned as part of the assignment.  
In the case of existing rights, such recognition must be possible at the 
time of the assignment. If future rights are included in the bundle, in 
accordance with Article 9.1.5 identification must be possible when the 
rights come into existence.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
Retailer A assigns all its receivables to factor B. There are thousands 
of existing and/or future rights. The assignment does not require the 
specification of each single claim. Later, B gives notice of the 
assignment to the obligor of a specific receivable. B must be able to 
demonstrate the inclusion of that receivable in the bundle either at 
the time of the assignment, or, in the case of a right which did not 
exist yet at that time, when the right came into existence. 
ARTICLE  9.1.7  
(Agreement between assignor  
and assignee sufficient) 
(1) A right is assigned by mere agreement 
between the assignor and the assignee, without 
notice to the obligor.  
(2) The consent of the obligor is not 
required unless the obligation in the circum-
stances is of an essentially personal character. 
COMMENT 
In the definition of Article 9.1.1 the assignment of a right is 
described as a “transfer by agreement”. Articles 9.1.7 to 9.1.15 govern 
the respective legal positions of assignor, assignee and obligor.  
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.7 
 
311 
1. Mere agreement between assignor and assignee 
According to paragraph (1) of this Article, the assignment of a right 
is effective, i.e. the right is transferred from the assignor’s assets to the 
assignee’s assets, by mere agreement between these two parties. The 
provision is an application to the assignment of a right of the general 
principle laid down in Article 1.2 according to which nothing in the 
Principles requires a contract to be concluded in a particular form. Yet it 
does not affect the possible application of mandatory rules of the 
otherwise applicable law according to Article 1.4: thus, for instance, an 
assignment for security purposes may be subject to special requirements 
as to form.  
As already stated in Comment 4 on Article 9.1.1, the rule laid down 
in paragraph (1) remains subject to third party rights, which are partly 
covered by other provisions of this Section (see Articles 9.1.10 and 
9.1.11 concerning the obligor and successive assignees), and may in 
some instances be governed by mandatory rules of the otherwise 
applicable law (e.g. the law of bankruptcy) according to Article 1.4. 
However, it should be stressed that notice to the obligor as provided for 
by Article 9.1.10 is not a condition for the effectiveness of the transfer 
of the right(s) between the assignor and the assignee. 
2.  Consent of the obligor in principle not required 
Paragraph (2) states explicitly what is already implied in paragraph 
(1), i.e. that the obligor’s consent is not required for the assignment to 
be effective between the assignor and the assignee. 
3. Exception: obligation of an essentially personal character 
An exception is made for the case in which the right to be assigned 
relates to an obligation of an essentially personal character, i.e. a right 
that has been granted by the obligor specifically to the person of the 
obligee. This characteristic prevents the right from being assigned 
without the consent of the obligor, since it would be inappropriate to 
oblige the obligor to perform in favour of another person. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Company X promises to sponsor activities organised by 
organisation A, engaged in the defence of human rights. A wishes to 
assign the right to organisation B, active in the protection of the 
environment. The assignment can only take place with X’s 
agreement. 
Art. 9.1.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
312 
2. 
A famous soprano has made a contract with agent A to sing in 
concerts organised by A. A sells its claims against the soprano to 
agent B. This transfer will require the soprano’s consent, if the 
circumstances reveal that she was willing to sing only for A. 
4.  Effect of other provisions 
The possibility to assign a right without the obligor’s consent may be 
affected by the presence of a non-assignment clause in the contract 
between the assignor and the obligor (see Article 9.1.9), although such a 
clause does not in itself necessarily imply the essentially personal 
character of the obligation. 
This Article does not address the issue of the necessity to give notice 
of the assignment to the obligor in order to avoid that the obligor pay the 
assignor after the assignment has taken place. On these issues, see 
Articles 9.1.10 and 9.1.11. 
ARTICLE  9.1.8  
(Obligor’s additional costs) 
The obligor has a right to be compensated 
by the assignor or the assignee for any additional 
costs caused by the assignment. 
COMMENT 
1.  Compensation for additional costs 
The assignment of a right does not necessarily affect the obligor’s 
rights and obligations. However, should the obligor bear additional costs 
due to the fact that performance has to be rendered to the assignee 
instead of the original obligee, this Article entitles the obligor to require 
due compensation. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Company X is obliged to reimburse a loan of EUR 1,000,000 to 
company A. Both companies are located in country M. A assigns its 
right to company B, located in country N. X has a right to be 
compensated for the additional costs involved in what has now 
become an international transfer. 
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.9 
 
313 
The rule laid down in this Article is in conformity with Article 6.1.6, 
which provides a similar solution if a party to the contract changes its 
place of business after the conclusion of the contract. 
2. Compensation by the assignor or the assignee 
The obligor may claim compensation for additional costs either from 
the assignor or from the assignee. In the case of a monetary obligation, 
the obligor will often be in a position to set off its right to compensation 
against the obligation it owes to the assignee.  
3.  Partial assignment 
Additional costs may arise in particular in the case of partial 
assignment (see Article 9.1.4). This Article applies accordingly. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
2. 
In Illustration 2 to Article 9.1.4, A has assigned to B part of its 
right to receive a delivery of steel from X. Instead of having to 
deliver 1,000 tons to A, X became obliged to deliver 700 tons to A 
and 300 tons to B. X is entitled to be compensated for the additional 
costs resulting from having to deliver in two parts. 
4. Obligation becoming significantly more burdensome 
In two cases compensation for additional costs is not considered to 
be a sufficient remedy. Firstly, under Article 9.1.3 the assignment of a 
right to a non-monetary performance is not allowed when it would 
render the obligation significantly more burdensome. Secondly, under 
Article 9.1.4 the partial assignment of a right to a non-monetary 
performance is also not allowed in similar circumstances.  
ARTICLE  9.1.9  
(Non-assignment clauses) 
(1) The assignment of a right to the 
payment of a monetary sum is effective notwith-
standing an agreement between the assignor and 
the obligor limiting or prohibiting such an 
assignment. However, the assignor may be liable 
to the obligor for breach of contract. 
Art. 9.1.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
314 
(2) The assignment of a right to other 
performance is ineffective if it is contrary to an 
agreement between the assignor and the obligor 
limiting or prohibiting the assignment. Never-
theless, the assignment is effective if the assignee, 
at the time of the assignment, neither knew nor 
ought to have known of the agreement. The 
assignor may then be liable to the obligor for 
breach of contract. 
COMMENT 
1. Balance of interests 
According to Article 9.1.7(2) the consent of the obligor is not 
required for the assignment to be effective between the assignor and the 
assignee unless the obligation is of an essentially personal character. 
However, in practice it is frequent for the contract between the original 
obligee/assignor and the obligor to contain a clause limiting or 
prohibiting the assignment of the original obligee/assignor’s rights as 
the obligor may not wish to change obligee. Should the original 
obligee/assignor subsequently assign such rights in spite of the non-
assignment clause, the conflicting interests of the obligor and of the 
assignee must be weighed. The obligor suffers a violation of its 
contractual rights, but the assignee must equally be protected. At a more 
general level, it is also important to favour the assignment of rights as an 
efficient means of financing. 
In this respect this Article makes a distinction between the 
assignment of monetary rights and the assignment of rights to other 
performances.  
2. Monetary rights 
In the case of the assignment of monetary rights, paragraph (1) gives 
preference to the needs of credit. The assignee of a monetary right is 
protected against non-assignment clauses and the assignment is fully 
effective. However, as the assignor acts contrary to its contractual 
duties, it is liable in damages to the obligor for non-performance of the 
contract under Chapter 7, Section 4. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Contractor A is entitled to the payment of USD 100,000 from 
its customer X after a certain stage of construction work has been 
completed. The contract contains a clause prohibiting A from 
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.9 
 
315 
assigning the right. A nevertheless assigns the right to bank B. B can 
rely on the assignment despite the clause, and can claim payment 
when it is due. X is however entitled to sue A for acting in breach of 
the clause. X could for instance claim damages if it demonstrates that 
it has suffered some prejudice. 
2. 
Company X is to reimburse EUR 500,000 to company A at a 
date when it can set off this obligation partially with a claim of EUR 
200,000 it has against A. The contract between X and A contains a 
non-assignment clause. Disregarding that clause, A assigns its right 
to reimbursement to company B. X may claim damages against A for 
the costs it incurs in having to engage in a separate procedure to 
recover the sum of EUR 200,000.  
3.  Non-monetary rights 
The assignment of rights to non-monetary performances does not 
have the same relationship to credit, thus justifying another solution 
which is to be found in paragraph (2). In order to achieve a fair balance 
between the conflicting interests of the three parties concerned, the rule 
is that non-assignment clauses are given effect vis-à-vis the assignee 
with the result that the assignment is ineffective. The solution is 
however reversed if it can be established that, at the time of the 
assignment, the assignee did not know and ought not to have known of 
the non-assignment clause. In such a case, the assignment is effective, 
but the assignor may be liable in damages to the obligor for non-
performance of the contract under Chapter 7, Section 4. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Company X has agreed to communicate to company A all 
improvements it will develop to a technical process over a period of 
time. Their contract stipulates that A’s rights towards X may not be 
assigned. A does not need the technology for itself any longer and 
attempts to assign its rights to company B. Such an assignment is 
ineffective. X does not become B’s obligor. In such a case, B has a 
claim against A under Article 9.1.15(b).  
Art. 9.1.10 
UNIDROIT Principles 
316 
ARTICLE  9.1.10  
(Notice to the obligor) 
(1) Until the obligor receives a notice of 
the assignment from either the assignor or the 
assignee, it is discharged by paying the assignor. 
(2) After the obligor receives such a notice, 
it is discharged only by paying the assignee. 
COMMENT  
1.  Effect of notice on the obligor 
Whereas the assignment is effective between the assignor and the 
assignee as a result of their agreement (see Article 9.1.7), the obligor 
will be discharged by paying the assignor until it receives notice of the 
assignment. If the obligor pays the assignor, the assignee can recover 
that payment from the assignor (see Article 9.1.15(f)). Only after the 
obligor receives a notice of assignment does the assignment become 
effective towards the obligor. The obligor can then be discharged only 
by paying the assignee. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Seller A assigns its right to payment from buyer X to bank B. 
Neither A nor B gives notice to X. When payment is due, X pays A. 
This payment is fully valid and X is discharged. It will be up to B to 
recover it from A under Article 9.1.15(f). 
2. 
Seller A assigns to bank B its right to payment from buyer X. B 
immediately gives notice of the assignment to X. When payment is 
due, X still pays A. X is not discharged and B is entitled to oblige X 
to pay a second time. 
Before the obligor receives a notice of the assignment, it is 
discharged when it pays the assignor irrespective of whether it knew, or 
ought to have known, of the assignment. The purpose is to place the 
burden of informing the obligor of the assignment on the parties to the 
assignment agreement, i.e. the assignor and the assignee. This solution 
is considered to be justified in the context of international commercial 
contracts. However, it does not necessarily exclude that in certain 
circumstances the obligor will be liable for damages if it acted in bad 
faith when it paid the assignor.  
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.10 
 
317 
Parties sometimes resort to so-called “silent assignments”, where the 
assignor and the assignee agree not to inform the obligor of the 
assignment. This arrangement is valid between parties, but since the 
obligor receives no notice, it will be discharged by paying the assignor, 
as provided in Article 9.1.10(1). 
2. Meaning of “notice” 
“Notice” is to be understood in the broad sense of Article 1.10. 
Although this Article does not specify the content of the notice, the 
latter should indicate not only the fact of the assignment, but also the 
identity of the assignee, the specifications of the right transferred 
(subject to Article 9.1.6) and, in the case of partial assignment, the 
extent of the assignment. 
3.  Who should give notice 
Article 9.1.10(1) leaves the question of who should give notice open, 
i.e. whether it should be the assignor or the assignee. In practice, it is 
probable that in most cases the assignee will take the initiative, as it has 
a major interest in avoiding that the obligor will perform in favour of the 
assignor notwithstanding the assignment. But notice given by the 
assignor has the same effect. When notice is given by the assignee, the 
obligor may request adequate proof of the assignment (see 
Article 9.1.12). 
4.  When must notice be given 
This Article does not explicitly require notice to be given only after 
the assignment agreement has been concluded. In some cases the 
contract between a future assignor and the obligor will provide that the 
rights arising from it will be assigned to a financial institution. Whether 
this can be considered to be adequate notice having the consequences 
provided for in this Article is a matter of interpretation, and may 
possibly depend on the definiteness of the clause regarding the identity 
of the future assignee.  
5.  Revocation of notice 
Notice given to the obligor can be revoked in certain circumstances, 
e.g. if the assignment agreement itself becomes invalid, or if an 
assignment made for security purposes is no longer necessary. This will 
not affect payments made before the revocation to the person who was 
the assignee at the time, but if the obligor pays that person after the 
revocation it would no longer be discharged. 
Art. 9.1.11 
UNIDROIT Principles 
318 
ARTICLE  9.1.11  
(Successive assignments) 
If the same right has been assigned by the 
same assignor to two or more successive 
assignees, the obligor is discharged by paying 
according to the order in which the notices were 
received. 
COMMENT 
1.  Priority of first notice 
This Article deals with the case where the same assignor assigns the 
same right to different assignees. Normally this should not happen, 
although in practice it may occur, whether the assignor does so 
consciously or inadvertently. Preference is then given to the assignee 
who was the first to give notice. The other assignees can only claim 
against the assignor under Article 9.1.15(c) below. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
On 5 February seller A assigns its right to payment from buyer X to 
bank B, and then on 20 February to bank C. C notifies the 
assignment on 21 February, and B does so only on 25 February. X is 
discharged by paying C, even though the right was assigned to C 
after it had been assigned to B.  
Unlike the solution prevailing under certain jurisdictions, this Article 
does not take into consideration the actual or constructive knowledge 
the obligor may have of the assignment(s) in the absence of notice. This 
approach is motivated by the wish to encourage the giving of notice, 
thus ensuring a degree of certainty that is especially advisable in the 
context of international contracts. 
2.  No notice given 
If no notice is given by any of the successive assignees the obligor 
will be discharged by paying the assignor (see Article 9.1.10(1)). 
3.  Notice without adequate proof 
Notice by an assignee without there being adequate proof that the 
assignment has been made, may be ineffective under Article 9.1.12.

(Adequate proof of assignment) 
(1) If notice of the assignment is given by 
the assignee, the obligor may request the assignee 
to provide within a reasonable time adequate 
proof that the assignment has been made.  
(2) Until adequate proof is provided, the 
obligor may withhold payment.  
(3) Unless adequate proof is provided, 
notice is not effective.  
(4) Adequate proof includes, but is not 
limited to, any writing emanating from the 
assignor and indicating that the assignment has 
taken place. 
COMMENT 
Since receiving the notice of assignment has the important effects 
provided for in Articles 9.1.10 and 9.1.11, this Article intends to protect 
the obligor against the risk of receiving a fraudulent notice from a fake 
“assignee” by requiring adequate proof that the assignment has actually 
been made. Until adequate proof is provided, the obligor may withhold 
payment to the alleged assignee. If adequate proof is provided, notice is 
effective from the date it was provided.

On 1 December purchaser X has to pay USD 200,000 to contractor 
A as an instalment of the sum due for the construction of a plant. In 
October A assigns the right to bank B. Either A or B may give notice 
of the assignment to X. If B takes the initiative and writes to X that it 
has become the assignee of the sum, X may require B to provide 
adequate proof. Without prejudice to other types of evidence, B will 
probably produce the assignment agreement or any other writing 
from A confirming that the right has been assigned. Until such 
adequate proof is provided, X may withhold payment. 
Art. 9.1.13

ARTICLE  9.1.13  
(Defences and rights of set-off) 
(1) The obligor may assert against the 
assignee all defences that the obligor could assert 
against the assignor. 
(2) The obligor may exercise against the 
assignee any right of set-off available to the 
obligor against the assignor up to the time notice 
of assignment was received.  
COMMENT  
1.  Assertion of defences 
A right can in principle be assigned without the obligor’s consent 
(see Article 9.1.7(2)). This solution rests on the assumption that the 
assignment will not adversely affect the obligor’s legal situation.  
It can happen that the obligor would have been able to withhold or 
refuse payment to the original obligee on the basis of a defence such as 
the defective performance of that obligee’s obligations vis-à-vis the 
obligor. To determine whether such defences can be asserted also 
against the assignee, the respective interests of the parties have to be 
weighed: the obligor’s situation should not deteriorate as a result of the 
assignment, while the assignee has an interest in the integrity of the 
right it has acquired. 
According to paragraph (1) of this Article, the obligor may assert 
against the assignee all the defences that it would have been able to 
assert if the claim had been made by the assignor. In this case, however, 
the assignee will have a claim against the assignor under Article 
9.1.15(d). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Software company A promises customer X to install a new 
accounting application before the end of the year. The main payment 
is to take place one month after completion. A immediately assigns 
the right to bank B. When the payment is due, B wants to claim it 
from X, but the latter explains that the new software is not working 
properly and that the accounting department is in chaos. X refuses to 
pay until this catastrophic situation has been remedied. X is justified 
in asserting this defence against B, which can then claim against A 
under Article 9.1.15(d). 
The same solution applies to defences of a procedural nature.

Art. 9.1.14

I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
Company X sells a gas turbine to contractor A, to be 
incorporated into a plant built for customer B. When the work has 
been completed, A assigns the guarantee of satisfactory performance 
to B. When the turbine does not work properly, B sues X before a 
court at its place of business. X will successfully invoke the 
arbitration clause included in its contract with A. 
2.  Set-off 
According to paragraph (2), the obligor may exercise against the 
assignee any right of set-off provided that the right of set-off was 
available to the obligor under Article 8.1 before the notice of the 
assignment was given.  
This solution is in accord with the principle that the obligor’s 
situation should not deteriorate as a result of the assignment. The 
assignee’s interests are protected by the claim it may then have against 
the assignor under Article 9.1.15(e). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Company A assigns to company B the right to the payment of 
EUR 100,000 that it has against company X. X however has a claim 
of EUR 60,000 against A. The two claims have not yet been set off 
by notice given under Article 8.3 of the Principles, but the required 
conditions for set-off were satisfied before the assignment was 
notified. X may still exercise its right of set-off by giving notice to 
the assignee. B can then only claim EUR 40,000 from X. B can 
recover the difference from A which had undertaken under Article 
9.1.15(e) that the obligor would not give notice of set-off as regards 
the assigned right. 
ARTICLE  9.1.14  
(Rights related to the right assigned) 
The assignment of a right transfers to the 
assignee: 
(a) all the assignor’s rights to payment or 
other performance under the contract in respect 
of the right assigned, and 
(b) all rights securing performance of the 
right assigned.  
Art. 9.1.14 
UNIDROIT Principles 
322 
COMMENT 
1.  Scope of the assignment 
This provision is inspired by the same principle as Article 9.1.13. 
The assignment transfers the assignor’s right as it is, not only with the 
defences the obligor may be able to assert, but also with all the rights to 
payment or to other performances under the contract in respect of the 
right assigned, and all rights securing performance of the right assigned. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Bank A is entitled to receive reimbursement of a loan of EUR 
1,000,000 made to customer X, bearing interest at a rate of 3%. A 
assigns its right to reimbursement of the principal to bank B. The 
assignment also operates as a transfer of the right to interest and of 
the underlying security. 
2. 
The initial facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but the loan 
contract entitles A to claim early repayment if X fails to pay the 
interest due. This right is also transferred to B. 
3. 
The initial facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but X has 
deposited some shares as security to the benefit of A. This benefit is 
transferred to B, subject to the possible application of mandatory 
requirements of the otherwise applicable law under Article 1.4. 
2.  Partial assignment 
When a right is partially assigned, if the rights covered by Article 
9.1.14 are divisible they will be transferred in proportion. If they are not, 
parties should decide whether they are transferred to the assignee or 
whether they will remain with the assignor.  
3.  Contractual deviations 
The rule laid down in paragraph (1) may however be modified by an 
agreement between the assignor and the assignee, who may stipulate, for 
instance, a separate assignment of interest.  
4. Assignor’s co-operation 
It follows from the general duty to co-operate laid down in Article 
5.1.3 that the assignor is obliged to take all the steps necessary to permit 
the assignee to enjoy the benefit of accessory rights and securities. 
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.15 
 
323 
ARTICLE  9.1.15  
(Undertakings of the assignor) 
The assignor undertakes towards the 
assignee, except as otherwise disclosed to the 
assignee, that: 
(a) the assigned right exists at the time of 
the assignment, unless the right is a future right; 
(b) the assignor is entitled to assign the 
right; 
(c) the right has not been previously 
assigned to another assignee, and it is free from 
any right or claim from a third party; 
(d) the obligor does not have any defences; 
(e) neither the obligor nor the assignor has 
given notice of set-off concerning the assigned 
right and will not give any such notice; 
(f) the 
assignor 
will 
reimburse 
the 
assignee for any payment received from the 
obligor before notice of the assignment was given. 
COMMENT 
When assigning a right by agreement to the assignee, the assignor 
assumes several undertakings. 
1. Existence of the right 
The assigned right should exist at the time of the assignment. This 
would, for instance, not be the case if the payment had already been 
made or if the right to a payment had previously been avoided. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Company A assigns a bundle of rights to factor B. When 
required to pay by B, customer X demonstrates that the amount due 
had been paid to A before the assignment. B has a claim against A, 
since at the time of the assignment the right no longer existed. 
If, as permitted by Article 9.1.5, a future right is assigned, no such 
undertaking exists. 
Art. 9.1.15 
UNIDROIT Principles 
324 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
Company A assigns to bank B the royalties from a technology 
licence that is to be granted in the near future to company X. The 
licence never materialises. B has no claim against A. 
2. Assignor entitled to assign the right 
The assignor is entitled to assign the right. This is, for instance, not 
the case if there is a legal or contractual prohibition to assign the right.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Company X has agreed to communicate to company A all the 
improvements to a technical process that it will develop over a 
period of time. Their contract stipulates that A’s rights towards X 
cannot be assigned. A no longer needs the technology itself, and 
attempts to assign its rights to company B. This illustration was 
already given above, under Article 9.1.9, to give an example of an 
ineffective assignment. In this case, B has a claim against A under 
Article 9.1.15(b). It will be recalled that the solution would be 
reversed, should B demonstrate that it neither knew nor ought to 
have known of the non-assignment clause. 
3. No previous assignment, no third party rights or claims 
If the assignor has already assigned a right to another assignee, it is 
generally not entitled to make a second assignment of that same right 
and this prohibition could be considered as already covered by the 
undertaking under sub-paragraph (b). The practical importance of this 
hypothesis is such that a separate and explicit provision is justified. It 
will however be recalled that under Article 9.1.11 the second assignee 
may prevail over the first one if it gives earlier notice to the obligee.  
However, a previous assignment may have been made merely for 
security purposes. In this case, the right is still assignable, with proper 
disclosure to the second assignee. 
4.  No defence from the obligor 
According to Article 9.1.13(1), the obligor may assert against the 
assignee all the defences that the obligor would have been able to assert 
against the assignor. In such a case, the assignee has a claim against the 
assignor on the basis of this undertaking. 
 
Assignment of Rights 
Art. 9.1.15 
 
325 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
4. 
Bank B is the assignee of contractor A’s right to payment of a 
certain sum from customer X. When payment is due, X refuses to 
pay arguing that A did not perform its obligations properly. Such 
defence can be successfully set up against B under Article 9.1.13(1). 
B would then have a claim against A. 
5.  No notice of set-off 
The right of set-off may be exercised by the obligor against the 
assignee if it was available to the obligor before the notice of assign-
ment was received (see Article 9.1.13(2)). The assignor undertakes vis-
à-vis the assignee that neither the assignor nor the obligor has already 
given notice of set-off affecting the assigned right. The assignor also 
undertakes that such notice will not be given in the future. If, for 
instance, the obligor were to give such a notice to the assignee after the 
assignment, as permitted by Article 9.1.13(2), the assignee would have a 
claim against the assignor under Article 9.1.15(e). 
6.  Reimbursement of payment by the obligor 
Article 9.1.10(1) provides that until it receives the notice of 
assignment the obligor is discharged by paying the assignor. This is the 
correct solution to protect the obligor, but the assignor and the assignee 
have agreed between themselves on the transfer of the right. The 
assignor therefore undertakes that it will reimburse the assignee for any 
payment it received from the obligor before the notice of assignment 
was given. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
Seller A assigns to bank B its right to payment from buyer X. 
Neither A nor B gives notice to X. When payment is due, X pays A. 
As already explained in the Comment on Article 9.1.10, this 
payment is fully valid and X is discharged. However, Article 
9.1.15(f) enables B to recover the sum paid from A. 
7.  No undertaking concerning the obligor’s performance or solvency 
Parties to the assignment may certainly provide for an undertaking 
by the assignor concerning the obligor’s present or future solvency, or, 
more generally, the obligor’s performance of its obligations. However, 
without such an agreement, there is no such undertaking under this 
Article. 
Art. 9.1.15 
UNIDROIT Principles 
326 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
6. 
Company B is the assignee of company A’s right to payment of 
a certain sum from customer X. When payment is due, B finds out 
that X has become insolvent. B has to bear the consequences. The 
solution would be the same if B discovered that X was already 
insolvent at the time of the assignment. 
In case of breach of one of the assignor’s undertakings, the remedies 
provided for in Chapter 7 become available. The assignee may for 
instance claim damages from the assignor or terminate the agreement if 
the conditions of Article 7.3.1 et seq. are fulfilled. 
8. Effect of disclosure on undertaking 
Some of the assignor’s undertakings may be affected by disclosures 
made at the time of the transfer. The assignor may for instance advise 
the assignee of the existence of a claim by a third party, in which case 
the assignee may accept the transfer of the right at its own risk, with no 
undertaking on that matter on the part of the assignor. 
 
327 
SECTION  2: TRANSFER OF OBLIGATIONS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  9.2.1 
(Modes of transfer) 
An obligation to pay money or render other 
performance may be transferred from one person 
(the “original obligor”) to another person (the 
“new obligor”) either 
(a) by an agreement between the original 
obligor and the new obligor subject to Article 
9.2.3, or 
(b) by an agreement between the obligee 
and the new obligor, by which the new obligor 
assumes the obligation. 
COMMENT 
As is the case with the assignment of rights covered by Section 1 of 
this Chapter, also the transfer of obligations may serve useful economic 
purposes. For instance, if company A can claim payment from its 
customer B, but itself owes a similar amount to its supplier X, it may be 
practical to arrange for the customer to become the supplier’s obligor.  
Such a transfer of an obligation may occur in two different ways.  
1.  Transfer by agreement between the original obligor and the new 
obligor 
In practice, the more frequent of the two ways indicated in this 
Article to transfer an obligation is by agreement between the original 
obligor and the new obligor, with the obligee’s consent as required by 
Article 9.2.3.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Company A owes its supplier X EUR 50,000, and customer B 
owes the same sum to A. A and B agree that the latter will take over 
the former’s obligation towards X. The obligation is transferred if X 
agrees to the transaction. 
2. Transfer by agreement between the obligee and the new obligor 
Another possibility is an agreement between the obligee and the new 
obligor, by which the new obligor accepts to take over the obligation. 
Art. 9.2.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
328 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
2. 
The products of company X are sold by distributor A on a 
certain market. The contract between the parties is close to 
termination. Distributor B enters into negotiations with X, proposing 
to take over the distributorship. In order to gain X’s acceptance, B 
promises that it will assume a debt of EUR 50,000 still owed by A to 
X, and X accepts. B has become X’s obligor. 
3.  Obligee’s consent necessary 
In both cases, the obligee must give its consent to the transfer. This is 
obvious when the transfer occurs by agreement between the obligee and 
the new obligor. If it occurs by an agreement between the original 
obligor and the new obligor, the requirement is stated in Article 9.2.3. 
Consent may be given in advance under Article 9.2.4. 
Without the obligee’s consent, the obligor may agree with another 
person that the latter will perform the obligation under Article 9.2.6. 
4. Transfer by agreement only 
Only transfers by agreement are governed by this Section, as 
opposed to situations where the applicable law may provide for legal 
transfers (such as, under certain jurisdictions, the automatic transfer of 
obligations in the case of the merger of companies – see Article 9.2.2). 
5.  Obligations in respect of payment of money or other 
performance 
This Section is not restricted to the transfer of obligations in respect 
of payment of money. It covers also the transfer of obligations relating 
to other kinds of performance, such as the rendering of a service. Nor 
are transferable obligations limited to obligations of a contractual 
nature. Obligations deriving from tort law or based on a judgment, for 
instance, can be governed by this Section, subject to Article 1.4. 
6.  What is meant by “transfer” 
The “transfer” of an obligation means that it leaves the original 
obligor’s assets to enter those of the new obligor.  
However, in some cases although the new obligor becomes bound 
towards the obligee, the original obligor is not discharged (see 
Article 9.2.5). 
 
 
Transfer of Obligations

ARTICLE  9.2.2 
(Exclusion) 
This Section does not apply to transfers of 
obligations 
made 
under 
the 
special 
rules 
governing transfers of obligations in the course of 
transferring a business. 
COMMENT 
The Articles contained in this Section do not apply to transfers of 
obligations made in the course of transferring a business under any 
special rules governing such transfers, as may happen in the case of the 
merger of companies. The applicable law often provides for 
mechanisms that cause all rights and obligations to be transferred under 
certain conditions in their entirety by operation of law.  
Article 9.2.2 does not prevent this Section from applying when 
certain obligations pertaining to the transferred business are transferred 
individually.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
1. 
Company A is transferred to company B. If the otherwise 
applicable law provides that all obligations pertaining to the former 
company are automatically transferred to the latter, the Principles do 
not apply.  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but B has reasons to 
prefer not to become the obligor of company X, one of A’s suppliers. 
A can transfer the obligations concerned to company C, with the 
consent of X. This particular transfer is subject to the Principles. 
ARTICLE  9.2.3  
(Requirement of obligee’s consent to transfer) 
The transfer of an obligation by an 
agreement between the original obligor and the 
new obligor requires the consent of the obligee.  
Art. 9.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
330 
COMMENT 
1.  Agreement between the original and the new obligor 
As stated in Article 9.2.1(a), the transfer of an obligation may occur 
by an agreement between the original obligor and the person who will 
become the new obligor.  
2.  Obligee’s consent required 
This agreement, however, does not suffice to transfer the obligation. 
It is also necessary for the obligee to give its consent. 
This is different from the corresponding rule on the assignment of 
rights, where the operation is in principle effective without the consent 
of the obligor (see Article 9.1.7). The assignment of a right does not 
affect the obligor’s situation, except that the obligor will have to deliver 
performance to another person. On the contrary, a change of obligor 
may considerably affect the obligee’s position, as the new obligor may 
be less reliable than the original one. The change may therefore not be 
imposed on the obligee, who must consent to it. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
Company A owes USD 150,000 to company X, located in Asia, for 
services rendered. Due to a reorganisation of the group, A’s activities 
in Asia are taken over by affiliate company B. A and B agree that B 
will take over A’s debt towards X. The obligation is transferred only 
if X gives its consent.  
3.  Original obligor not necessarily discharged 
With the obligee’s consent, the new obligor becomes bound by the 
obligation. It does not necessarily follow that the original obligor is 
discharged (see Article 9.2.5). 
4.  Lack of consent by the obligee 
If the obligee refuses to consent to the transfer, or if its consent is not 
solicited, an arrangement for a third party performance is possible under 
Article 9.2.6. 
 
 
Transfer of Obligations 
Art. 9.2.4 
 
331 
ARTICLE  9.2.4  
(Advance consent of obligee) 
(1) The obligee may give its consent in 
advance. 
(2) If the obligee has given its consent in 
advance, the transfer of the obligation becomes 
effective when a notice of the transfer is given to 
the obligee or when the obligee acknowledges it. 
COMMENT 
1. Advance consent by the obligee 
Paragraph (1) of this Article provides that the obligee’s consent, 
required under Article 9.2.3, may be given in advance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Licensor X enters into a transfer of technology agreement with 
licensee A. For a period of ten years, A will have to pay royalties to 
X. When the contract is concluded, A envisages that at some time in 
the future it will prefer the royalties to be paid by its affiliate, 
company B. X may agree in advance in the contract to the obligation 
to pay the royalties being transferred by A to B. 
2.  When the transfer is effective as to the obligee 
According to paragraph (2), if the obligee has given its consent in 
advance, the transfer of the obligation becomes effective when it is 
notified to the obligee or when the obligee acknowledges it. This means 
that it is sufficient for either the original or the new obligor to notify the 
obligee of the transfer when it occurs. Notification is not needed if it 
appears that the obligee has acknowledged the transfer, to which it had 
given its consent in advance. “Acknowledgement” means giving an 
overt sign of having become aware of the transfer. 
Art. 9.2.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
332 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but there comes a 
time when A actually agrees with B that from then on the latter will 
take over the obligation to pay the royalties. This decision becomes 
effective when notice is given to X. 
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. No notice is given, 
but the first time B pays the yearly royalties, X writes to B to 
acknowledge receipt of the payment and to confirm that from then 
on it will expect B to pay the royalties. The transfer is effective with 
this acknowledgement. 
ARTICLE  9.2.5  
(Discharge of original obligor) 
(1) The obligee may discharge the original 
obligor. 
(2) The obligee may also retain the 
original obligor as an obligor in case the new 
obligor does not perform properly. 
(3) Otherwise the original obligor and the 
new obligor are jointly and severally liable. 
COMMENT 
1.  Extent of original obligor’s discharge 
The obligee’s consent, whether given under Article 9.2.1(b) or under 
Article 9.2.3, has the effect of binding the new obligor to the obligation. 
What still remains to be determined is whether the original obligor is 
discharged. It is primarily up to the obligee to choose among different 
options. Only in the case of Article 9.2.1(b) will the choice depend also 
on the original obligor.  
2. Obligee’s choice: full discharge 
The obligee may first of all fully discharge the original obligor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Supplier X accepts that its obligor company A transfer its 
obligation to pay the price to customer B. Fully confident that the new 
obligor is solvent and reliable, X discharges A. Should B fail to 
perform, the loss will be on X who will have no recourse against A. 
 
Transfer of Obligations 
Art. 9.2.5 
 
333 
3.  Obligee’s choice: original obligor retained as a subsidiary obligor 
Another possibility is for the obligee to accept the transfer of the 
obligation from the original obligor to the new obligor on condition that 
it retain a claim against the original obligor.  
There are two options. 
The first option is that the original obligor is retained as an obligor in 
the event that the new obligor does not perform properly. In this case the 
obligee must claim performance first from the new obligor, but if the 
new obligor does not perform properly the obligee may call upon the 
original obligor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
Supplier X accepts that its obligor company A transfer its 
obligation to pay the price to customer B, but this time stipulates that 
A will remain bound if B does not perform properly. X no longer has 
a direct claim against A, and must first request performance from B. 
However, should B fail to perform, X will have a claim against A. 
4. Obligee’s choice: original obligor and new obligor jointly and 
severally liable 
The second option, the one most favourable to the obligee, is to 
consider the original obligor and the new obligor jointly and severally 
liable. This means that when performance is due, the obligee can 
exercise its claim against either the original or the new obligor (see 
Articles 11.1.3 et seq.). Should the obligee obtain performance from the 
original obligor, the latter would then have a claim against the new 
obligor (see Articles 11.1.10 et seq.). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Supplier X accepts that its obligor company A transfer its 
obligation to pay the price to customer B, but stipulates that A and B 
will remain jointly and severally liable. In this case X may request 
performance from either A or B. Should B perform properly, both A 
and B would be fully discharged. Should A have to render 
performance to X, it would then have right of recourse against B. 
5. Default rule 
The language of this Article makes it clear that the last-mentioned 
option is the default rule. In other words, if the obligee has neither 
indicated that it intends to discharge the original obligor, nor indicated 
that it intends to keep the original obligor as a subsidiary obligor, the 
original obligor and the new obligor are jointly and severally liable.
Art. 9.2.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
334 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
Supplier X accepts that its obligor company A transfer its 
obligation to pay the price to customer B, but says nothing about the 
liability of A. Also in this case X may request performance from 
either A or B. Should B perform properly, both the original and the 
new obligor would be fully discharged. Should A have to render 
performance to X, it would then have right of recourse against B. 
6.  Original obligor refusing to be discharged 
When the obligation is assumed by means of an agreement between 
the obligee and the new obligor, as provided in Article 9.2.1(b), and the 
agreement provides that the original obligor is discharged, the agree-
ment amounts to a contract in favour of a third party. Under Article 
5.2.6 such a benefit cannot be imposed on the beneficiary, who may 
have reasons not to accept it. The original obligor may thus refuse to be 
discharged by the agreement between the obligee and the new obligor.  
If such a refusal occurs, the new obligor is bound to the obligee, but 
the original obligor and the new obligor are jointly and severally liable, 
in accordance with the default rule of Article 9.2.5(3).  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the 
obligation is assumed by an agreement between X and B, and that X 
discharges A. If A is no longer interested in a business relationship 
with B, it may accept to be discharged. On the other hand, if A wants 
to keep the possibilities it has of benefiting from a renewal of its 
contract with X, it might wish to keep the relationship and may 
therefore refuse to be discharged. 
ARTICLE  9.2.6  
(Third party performance) 
(1) Without the obligee’s consent, the 
obligor may contract with another person that this 
person will perform the obligation in place of the 
obligor, unless the obligation in the circumstances 
has an essentially personal character.  
(2) The obligee retains its claim against the 
obligor. 
 
Transfer of Obligations 
Art. 9.2.6 
 
335 
COMMENT 
1. Agreement on performance by another party 
Obligations can be transferred either by an agreement between the 
original obligor and the new obligor, with the obligee’s consent (see 
Article 9.2.1(a)), or by an agreement between the obligee and the new 
obligor (see Article 9.2.1(b)). 
There may be situations in which the consent of the obligee is 
lacking, either because it has not been solicited, or because it has been 
refused. In such cases the obligor may agree with another person that 
this person will perform the obligation in its place. When performance 
becomes due, the other person will render it to the obligee.  
While an obligee may refuse to accept a new obligor before 
performance is due, in principle it may not refuse to accept the 
performance itself when it is offered by another party.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Companies A and B have entered into a co-operation agreement 
for their activities on a certain market. At a certain point they decide to 
redistribute some of their tasks. Thus, B will take over all operations 
concerning 
telecommunications 
which 
were 
previously 
A’s 
responsibility. On the following 30 October A would have been bound 
to pay company X, a local operator, a sum of USD 100,000. The two 
partners agree that B will pay that amount when it is due. On 30 
October X may not refuse such a payment made by B. 
2.  Obligation of an essentially personal character 
Third party performances may not be refused by the obligee in all the 
cases in which they would be equally satisfactory as performances 
rendered by the obligor. The situation is different when the performance 
due is of an essentially personal character, linked to the obligor’s 
specific qualifications. The obligee may then insist on receiving 
performance by the obligor itself. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
In Illustration 1, B also takes over operations for the 
maintenance of some sophisticated technological equipment 
developed by A and sold to company Y. The partners agree that the 
next yearly maintenance will be carried out by B. When B’s 
technicians arrive at Y’s premises, Y may refuse their intervention, 
invoking the fact that due to the highly technical nature of the 
Art. 9.2.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
336 
verifications involved, they are entitled to receive performance from 
the specialised staff of A. 
ARTICLE  9.2.7 
(Defences and rights of set-off) 
(1) The new obligor may assert against the 
obligee all defences which the original obligor 
could assert against the obligee. 
(2) The new obligor may not exercise 
against the obligee any right of set-off available to 
the original obligor against the obligee. 
COMMENT 
1. Assertion of defences 
The obligation transferred to the new obligor is the very same 
obligation that used to bind the original obligor (and, in some cases, still 
binds it - see Article 9.2.5). 
Whenever the original obligor would have been able to withhold or 
refuse payment to the obligee on the basis of a defence, such as the 
defective performance of the obligee’s own obligations, the new obligor 
may rely on the same defence against the obligee. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Company A owes company X EUR 200,000, due to be paid at 
the end of the year, as payment for facilities management services. 
With X’s consent A transfers this obligation to company B. X 
renders A extremely defective services which would have given A a 
valid defence for refusing payment. When payment is due, B may 
assert the same defence against X.  
2.  Defences of a procedural nature 
The same solution applies to defences of a procedural nature. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that X sues B 
before a court at its place of business. B can successfully invoke the 
arbitration clause included in the contract between A and X. 
 
 
Transfer of Obligations 
Art. 9.2.8 
 
337 
3. Set-off 
The right of set-off relating to an obligation owed by the obligee to 
the original obligor may however not be exercised by the new obligor. 
The reciprocity requirement is not fulfilled between the obligee and the 
new obligor. The original obligor may still exercise its right of set-off if 
it has not been discharged.  
ARTICLE  9.2.8  
(Rights related to the obligation transferred) 
(1) The obligee may assert against the new 
obligor all its rights to payment or other 
performance under the contract in respect of the 
obligation transferred. 
(2) If the original obligor is discharged 
under Article 9.2.5(1), a security granted by any 
person other than the new obligor for the 
performance of the obligation is discharged, 
unless that other person agrees that it should 
continue to be available to the obligee. 
(3) Discharge of the original obligor also 
extends to any security of the original obligor 
given to the obligee for the performance of the 
obligation, unless the security is over an asset 
which is transferred as part of a transaction 
between the original obligor and the new obligor.  
COMMENT 
1.  Scope of the transfer 
The rules laid down in this Article are inspired by the same principle 
as Article 9.2.7. The obligation is transferred to the new obligor as it is, 
not only with the defences the original obligor was able to assert, but 
also with all the rights to payment or to other performances under the 
contract that the obligee had in respect of the obligation transferred. 
The following illustrations provide examples of such rights. 
Art. 9.2.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
338 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Company A must reimburse bank X for a loan of EUR 
1,000,000 bearing an interest rate of 3%. A transfers its obligation to 
reimburse the principal to company B. The transfer also includes the 
obligation to pay the 3% interest. 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the loan 
contract entitles X to claim premature reimbursement if A fails to 
pay the interest due. X can assert also this right against B. 
2. Contractual deviations 
Party autonomy permits deviations from the rules laid down in this 
Article, such as a separate transfer of the obligation to pay interest.  
3.  Securities in assignment of rights and transfer of obligations 
compared 
In the case of the assignment of a right, all rights securing 
performance are automatically transferred to the assignee (see Article 
9.1.14(b)). This solution is justified by the fact that the assignment of a 
right does not alter the obligor’s situation, i.e. securities can continue to 
serve their purposes in unchanged circumstances. 
The transfer of an obligation to a new obligor on the contrary 
modifies the context in which the security has been granted. If the 
original obligor is discharged, and if the security were to be transferred 
with the obligation, the risk of breach or insolvency to be covered would 
be that of another person, thus completely altering the object of the 
security. 
4.  
Suretyship 
If the original obligor’s obligation was covered by a suretyship 
granted by another person, this suretyship can survive if the original 
obligor remains bound. If, on the other hand, the original obligor is 
discharged, the suretyship cannot be transferred to cover the new 
obligor, unless the person who granted the suretyship agrees that it 
should continue to be available to the obligee. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Company A owes USD 1,000,000 to company X. Bank S has 
agreed to guarantee due performance of this obligation. With X’s 
agreement, A transfers the obligation to company B, and X accepts 
to discharge A. S does not guarantee B’s obligation, unless it agrees 
to continue to provide the security. 
 
Transfer of Obligations 
Art. 9.2.8 
 
339 
A special case occurs when the suretyship was granted by the person 
who was itself to become the new obligor. In such a case, the security 
necessarily disappears, since a person cannot provide a security for its 
own obligation. 
5.  Securities over assets 
The original obligor may have given one of its assets as security. In 
this case, if the obligation is transferred and the original obligor is 
discharged, the security ceases to cover the obligation now binding the 
new obligor.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
Bank X has granted a loan of EUR 100,000 to company A, 
secured by a deposit of shares by the obligor. With X’s agreement, A 
transfers the obligation to pay back the loan to company B, and X 
accepts to discharge A. The shares cease to serve as security. 
The solution is different if the asset given as security is transferred as 
part of a transaction between the original and the new obligor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 4, but the transfer of the 
obligation between A and B occurs as part of a broader operation in 
which ownership of the shares is also transferred to B. In such a 
situation, the shares will continue to serve as security for B’s 
obligation to reimburse the loan. 
340 
SECTION  3: ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  9.3.1  
(Definitions) 
“Assignment of a contract” means the 
transfer by agreement from one person (the 
“assignor”) to another person (the “assignee”) of 
the assignor’s rights and obligations arising out of 
a contract with another person (the “other 
party”). 
COMMENT 
Rights and obligations can be transferred separately, under the 
respective rules of Sections 1 and 2 of this Chapter. In some cases, 
however, a contract is assigned as a whole. More precisely, a person 
transfers to another person all the rights and obligations deriving from 
its being a party to a contract. A contractor, for instance, may wish to let 
another contractor replace it as one of the parties in a construction 
contract. The Articles of this Section cover the assignment of contracts 
as defined in this Article.  
Only transfers by agreement are concerned, as opposed to various 
situations where the applicable law may provide for legal transfers (such 
as, under certain jurisdictions, the automatic transfer of contracts in the 
case of the merger of companies - see Article 9.3.2). 
ARTICLE  9.3.2  
(Exclusion) 
This Section does not apply to the assign-
ment of contracts made under the special rules 
governing transfers of contracts in the course of 
transferring a business. 
COMMENT 
The assignment of contracts may be subject to special rules of the 
applicable law when it is made in the course of the transfer of a 
 
Assignment of Contracts 
Art. 9.3.3 
 
341 
business. Such special rules often provide for mechanisms that cause all 
contracts of the business to be transferred, under certain conditions, by 
operation of law.  
This Article does not prevent the present Section from applying 
when certain contracts pertaining to the transferred business are 
assigned individually.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Company A is transferred to company B. If the otherwise 
applicable law provides that all contracts to which the former 
company was a party are automatically transferred to the latter, the 
Principles do not apply.  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but B is not 
interested in taking over a particular contract with company X, and 
prefers that contract to be assigned to company C. This particular 
transfer is subject to the Principles. 
ARTICLE  9.3.3  
(Requirement of consent of the other party) 
The assignment of a contract requires the 
consent of the other party. 
COMMENT 
1.  Agreement between assignor and assignee 
The first requirement for the assignment of a contract is that the 
assignor and the assignee agree on the operation. 
2.  Other party’s consent required 
This agreement does not however suffice to transfer the contract. It is 
also necessary for the other party to give its consent. 
If it were only for the assignment of the rights involved, such a 
consent would in principle not be needed (see Article 9.1.7). However, 
the assignment of a contract also involves a transfer of obligations, 
which cannot be effective without the obligee’s consent (see Article 
9.2.3). The assignment of a contract can thus only occur with the other 
party’s consent. 
Art. 9.3.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
342 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
Office space is let by owner X to company A. The contract expires 
only six years from the date of the contract. Due to the development 
of its business, A wants to move to larger premises. Company B 
would be interested in taking over the lease. The contract can be 
assigned by an agreement between A and B, but the operation also 
requires X’s consent. 
3.  Assignor not necessarily discharged of its obligations 
With the other party’s consent, the assignee becomes bound by the 
assignor’s obligations under the assigned contract. It does not 
necessarily follow that the assignor is discharged (see Article 9.3.5). 
ARTICLE  9.3.4  
(Advance consent of the other party) 
(1) The other party may give its consent in 
advance. 
(2) If the other party has given its consent 
in advance, the assignment of the contract 
becomes effective when a notice of the assignment 
is given to the other party or when the other party 
acknowledges it. 
COMMENT 
1.  Advance consent by the other party 
Paragraph (1) of this Article provides that the other party’s consent, 
required under Article 9.3.3, may be given in advance.  
This rule, concerning the assignment of contracts, corresponds to the 
rule in Article 9.2.4 according to which the obligee, who must consent 
to the transfer of the obligation may give its consent in advance. 
Similarly, the other party, who must consent to the assignment of the 
contract, may also give its consent in advance. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
Company X enters into an agreement with agency A, providing 
that the latter will be responsible for advertising X’s products in 
country M for the next five years. A, however, is already
 
Assignment of Contracts 
Art. 9.3.5 
 
343 
considering ceasing its activities in country M in the not too distant 
future, and obtains X’s advance consent to the subsequent 
assignment of the contract to agency B, located in country M’s 
capital. This advance consent is effective under Article 9.3.4. 
2.  When the assignment of the contract is effective vis-à-vis the 
other party 
According to paragraph (2), if the other party has given its consent in 
advance, the assignment of the contract becomes effective when it is 
notified to the other party or when the other party acknowledges it. This 
means that it is sufficient for either the assignor or the assignee to notify 
the assignment when it occurs. Notification is not needed if it appears 
that the obligee has acknowledged the transfer, to which it had given its 
consent in advance. “Acknowledgement” means giving an overt sign of 
having become aware of the transfer.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. When A actually 
assigns its contract to B, the assignment becomes effective vis-à-vis 
the other party when either A or B notifies it to X. 
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. No notice is given, 
but B sends X a proposal for a new advertising campaign. X 
understands that the assignment has taken place and sends its 
comments on the proposal to B. The assignment of the contract is 
effective with this acknowledgement. 
ARTICLE  9.3.5  
(Discharge of the assignor) 
(1) The other party may discharge the 
assignor. 
(2) The other party may also retain the 
assignor as an obligor in case the assignee does 
not perform properly. 
(3) Otherwise 
the 
assignor 
and 
the 
assignee are jointly and severally liable. 
Art. 9.3.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
344 
COMMENT 
1.  Extent of assignor’s discharge 
This Article, concerning the assignment of contracts, corresponds to 
Article 9.2.5. To the extent that the assignment of a contract causes 
obligations to be transferred from the assignor to the assignee, the other 
party, as an obligee, may decide the effect that the acceptance of the 
assignee as a new obligor will have on the assignor’s obligations. This 
Article gives the other party several choices and provides for a default 
rule. 
2. Other party’s choice: full discharge 
The other party may first of all fully discharge the assignor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
By contract with company X, company A has undertaken to 
dispose of the waste produced by an industrial process. At a certain 
point, X accepts that the contract is assigned by A to company B. Fully 
confident that B is solvent and reliable, X discharges A. Should B fail 
to perform properly, X will have no recourse against A. 
3.  Other party’s choice: assignor retained as a subsidiary obligor 
Another possibility is for the other party to accept the assignment of 
the contract on condition that it retain a claim against the assignor.  
There are two options. 
The first option is that the assignor is retained as an obligor in the 
event that the assignee does not perform properly. In this case the other 
party must necessarily claim performance first from the assignee, but if 
the assignee does not perform properly, the other party may call upon 
the assignor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that X, when 
consenting to the assignment, has stipulated that A will remain bound 
if B does not perform properly. X no longer has a direct claim against 
A, and must first request performance from B. However, should B fail 
to perform, then X would have a claim against A. 
 
Assignment of Contracts 
Art. 9.3.5 
 
345 
4. Other party’s choice: assignor retained as jointly and severally 
liable with the assignee  
The second option, the one most favourable to the other party, is to 
consider the assignor and the assignee jointly and severally liable. This 
means that when performance is due, the other party can exercise its 
claim against either the assignor or the assignee (see Articles 11.1.3 et 
seq.). Should the other party obtain performance from the assignor, the 
latter would then have a claim against the assignee (see Articles 11.1.10 
et seq.). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
Company X accepts that company A assign the contract to 
company B, but stipulates that A and B will remain jointly and 
severally liable. In this case X may require performance from either 
A or B. Should B perform properly, both A and B would be fully 
discharged. Should A have to render performance to X, it would then 
have a right of recourse against B. 
5. Default rule 
The language of this Article makes it clear that the last-mentioned 
option is the default rule. In other words, if the other party has neither 
indicated that it intends to discharge the assignor, nor indicated that it 
intends to keep the assignor as a subsidiary obligor, the assignor and the 
assignee are jointly and severally liable. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4. 
Company X accepts that company A assign the contract to 
company B, but says nothing about the liability of A. Also in this 
case X may request performance from either A or B. Should B 
perform properly, both A and B would be fully discharged. Should A 
have to render performance to X, it would then have a right of 
recourse against B. 
6. Differentiated options possible 
A party to a contract is often subject to a whole set of obligations. 
When the contract is assigned, the other party may choose to exercise 
different options with regard to the different obligations. The other party 
may for instance accept to discharge the assignor for a certain 
obligation, but to retain it either as a subsidiary obligor or to consider it 
jointly and severally liable with the assignee with respect to other 
obligations. 
Art. 9.3.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
346 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5. 
Company A has entered into a know-how licence contract with 
company X. In return for the transferred technology, A has 
undertaken to pay royalties and to co-operate with X in the 
development of a new product. When X later on accepts that A 
assign the contract to company B, X discharges A from the 
obligation to participate in the joint research, for which it will deal 
with the assignee only, but retains A as a subsidiary or a jointly and 
severally liable with B for the payment of royalties. 
ARTICLE  9.3.6 
(Defences and rights of set-off) 
(1) To the extent that the assignment of a 
contract involves an assignment of rights, Article 
9.1.13 applies accordingly. 
(2) To the extent that the assignment of a 
contract involves a transfer of obligations, Article 
9.2.7 applies accordingly. 
COMMENT 
The assignment of a contract entails both an assignment of the 
original rights and a transfer of the original obligations from the 
assignor to the assignee. The transaction should not adversely affect the 
other party’s situation as an obligor and it should put the assignee in the 
same situation as the assignor in its capacity as obligor. 
As a consequence, the provisions concerning defences in Sections 1 
and 2 of this Chapter apply accordingly. When the assignee exercises its 
rights, the other party may assert all the defences it could have asserted 
as obligor if the claim had been made by the assignor (see Article 
9.1.13). When the other party exercises its rights, the assignee may 
assert all the defences that the assignor could have asserted as obligor if 
the claim had been made against it (see Article 9.2.7) 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Company X has out-sourced its risk management department to 
consultant A. With X’s consent, the contract is assigned to consultant 
B. Due to A’s incompetence, X was not properly insured for a loss it 
subsequently suffered. Pending indemnification, X may suspend 
paying B the agreed fees.

2. 
Airline A has a contract with catering company X. A transfers 
the operation of its flights to certain destinations to airline B. With 
X’s consent, the catering contract is assigned by A to B. Litigation 
later arises, and X sues B before a court at its place of business. As a 
procedural defence B may successfully invoke that the assigned 
contract includes an arbitration clause.  
ARTICLE  9.3.7 
(Rights transferred with the contract) 
(1) To the extent that the assignment of a 
contract involves an assignment of rights, Article 
9.1.14 applies accordingly. 
(2) To the extent that the assignment of a 
contract involves a transfer of obligations, Article 
9.2.8 applies accordingly. 
COMMENT 
The assignment of a contract entails both an assignment of the 
original rights and a transfer of the original obligations from the 
assignor to the assignee. In parallel to what has been said about defences 
under Article 9.3.6, the operation should not adversely affect the other 
party’s situation as an obligee and it should place the assignee in the 
same situation as the assignor in its capacity as obligee. 
As a consequence, the provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of this Chapter 
concerning rights related to the claim assigned and to the obligation 
transferred will apply accordingly.  
When the assignee acts against the other party, it may assert all the 
rights to payment or other performances under the contract assigned 
with respect to the rights assigned, as well as all rights securing such 
performance (see Article 9.1.14). When the other party exercises its 
rights, it may assert all its rights to payment or other performances 
under the contract with respect to the obligation transferred against the 
assignee (see Article 9.2.8(1)). Securities granted for the performance of 
the assignor’s obligations are maintained or discharged in accordance 
with Article 9.2.8(2) and (3). 
Art. 9.3.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
348 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A service contract provides that late payment of the yearly fees 
due by customer X to supplier A will bear interest at the rate of 10%. 
With X’s consent, A assigns the contract to supplier B. When X fails 
to pay the yearly fees on time, B is entitled to claim such interest 
(see Article 9.1.14(a)). 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but X has also 
provided A with a bank guarantee covering payment of the fees. B 
may call upon that guarantee should X fail to pay the fees (see 
Article 9.1.14(b)). 
3. 
Company X has ordered the construction and installation of 
industrial equipment from company A. Performance levels have 
been agreed between the parties, and the contract provides for 
liquidated damages should actual performance be insufficient. With 
X’s consent, A assigns the contract to company B. The assignee 
delivers equipment that does not meet the required performance 
levels. X may avail itself of the liquidated damages against B (see 
Article 9.2.8(1)). 
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, but A has provided X 
with a bank guarantee covering satisfactory performance. The bank 
guarantee will not apply to B’s obligations resulting from the 
assignment, unless the bank accepts to continue to offer its guarantee 
in respect of the assignee’s obligations (see Article 9.2.8(2)). 
 
349 
CHAPTER  10 
 
 
 
LIMITATION PERIODS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  10.1 
(Scope of the Chapter) 
(1) The exercise of rights governed by the 
Principles is barred by the expiration of a period 
of time, referred to as “limitation period”, 
according to the rules of this Chapter.  
(2) This Chapter does not govern the time 
within which one party is required under the 
Principles, as a condition for the acquisition or 
exercise of its right, to give notice to the other 
party or to perform any act other than the 
institution of legal proceedings. 
COMMENT 
1. Notion of limitation period 
All legal systems recognise the influence of passage of time on 
rights. There are two basic systems. Under one system, the passage of 
time extinguishes rights and actions. Under the other system, the 
passage of time operates only as a defence against an action in court. 
Under the Principles a lapse of time does not extinguish rights, but 
operates only as a defence (see Article 10.9). 
This Article refers in general to “rights governed by the Principles” 
to indicate that not only the right to require performance or the right to 
another remedy for non-performance can be barred, but also the 
exercise of rights which directly affect a contract, such as the right of 
termination or a right of price reduction contractually agreed upon.  
Art. 10.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
350 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A sells a tanker to B. Upon delivery the ship turns out not to be 
in conformity with the specifications contained in the contract, but it 
is only three and a half years later that B brings an action against A 
for the cure of the defects. A may raise the defence of B’s claim 
being time-barred under Article 10.2. 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the 
contract between A and B contains a clause allowing B a price 
reduction of up to 30% in case of missing equipment or spare parts. 
B’s right to a price reduction is also barred.  
2. Notice requirements and other prerequisites for enforcing rights 
Under the Principles rights can be lost if the party entitled to acquire 
or exercise a right fails to give notice or to perform an act within a 
reasonable period of time, without undue delay, or within another fixed 
period of time (see Articles 2.1.1 – 2.1.22 (communications in the 
context of formation of contracts), Article 3.2.12 (notice of avoidance of 
the contract), Article 6.2.3 (request for re-negotiation), Article 7.2.2(e) 
(request for performance), Article 7.3.2(2) (notice of termination of the 
contract)). Although they serve a function similar to limitation periods, 
these special time-limits and their effects are not affected by the 
limitation periods provided for in this Chapter as they are designed to 
meet special needs. As they are generally much shorter than the 
limitation periods provided for in this Chapter, they take effect 
regardless of the latter. In the exceptional case that in the circumstances 
a “reasonable period of time” is longer than the applicable limitation 
period, the former will prevail.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B sets A 
an additional period of time of 60 days for the cure of the defects. A 
fails to cure the defects, but it is only two months after the expiry of 
the additional period fixed that B sends A a notice of termination 
under Article 7.3.2. Although B’s claim is not time-barred under 
Article 10.2, it has lost the right to terminate the contract because it 
has not given notice of termination within a reasonable time as 
required by Article 7.3.2(2).

3. Mandatory rules of domestic law 
In cases in which the parties’ reference to the Principles is 
considered to be only an agreement to incorporate them in the contract, 
mandatory rules on limitation periods of national, international or 
supranational origin relating to the length, suspension, and renewal of 
the limitation periods as well as to the right of the parties to modify 
them, prevail over the rules laid down in this Chapter (see Comment 2 
on Article 1.4). Yet even in cases in which the Principles are applied as 
the law governing the contract, domestic mandatory rules on limitation 
periods prevail over the rules laid down in this chapter, provided that 
they claim application whatever the law governing the contract (see 
Comment 3 on Article 1.4).

4. 
Seller A in country X sells and delivers component parts to car 
manufacturer B in country Y. Some of the parts are defective and the 
same year of delivery the defects cause accidents for which B has to 
pay damages. Four years later, B asks A to be indemnified for its 
costs. A refuses to pay. The contract provides for arbitration in 
country Z with the UNIDROIT Principles as the applicable law. In an 
arbitration commenced by B, A raises the defence of the expiration 
of the three-year limitation period provided for in Article 10.2. B 
responds that under the law of country X the claim for damages for 
defective goods is time-barred only after 5 years, and that this rule 
claims to apply irrespective of the law governing the contract. The 
rule of the law of country X prevails. 
ARTICLE  10.2 
(Limitation periods) 
(1) The general limitation period is three 
years beginning on the day after the day the 
obligee knows or ought to know the facts as a 
result of which the obligee’s right can be 
exercised.  
(2) In any event, the maximum limitation 
period is ten years beginning on the day after the 
day the right can be exercised. 
Art. 10.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
352 
COMMENT 
1. No common solution 
Although periods of limitation of rights and claims are common to all 
legal systems, they differ in length. They range from six months or one 
year for claims for breach of warranties, to up to 15, 20 or even 30 years 
for other claims. At international level the 1974 United Nations 
Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods 
(as amended in 1980) (“UN Limitation Convention”) provides uniform 
rules but is restricted to the international sale of goods. 
2. Relevant factors 
The stated length of a limitation period does not always in itself 
determine the time after which the exercise of rights is barred. That time 
may be affected by the prerequisites for the starting of the period and by 
circumstances affecting its running (see Articles 10.4 to 10.9). It may 
also be affected by the agreement of the parties (see Article 10.3). Party 
autonomy with regard to limitation periods is of great practical 
importance, as periods that are either too long or too short may be 
tolerable if the parties may modify them freely according to their needs. 
3. Balance between interests of obligee and obligor 
The Principles strike a balance between the conflicting interests of 
the obligee and the obligor of a dormant claim. An obligee should have 
a reasonable chance to pursue its right, and should therefore not be 
prevented from pursuing its right by the lapse of time before the right 
becomes due and can be enforced. Furthermore, the obligee should 
know or at least have a chance to know its right and the identity of the 
obligor. On the other hand, the obligee should be able to close its files 
after some time regardless of the obligor’s knowledge, and consequently 
a maximum period should be established. Contrary to the UN Limitation 
Convention which has only one absolute limitation period of four years 
which begins on the date of accrual of the claim (see Articles 8 and 
9(1)), the Principles provide for a two-tier system. 
4. Basic structure of the limitation regime 
The two-tier system adopts the policy that the obligee should not be 
barred before it has had a real possibility to pursue its right as a result of 
having actual or constructive knowledge of the right. Paragraph (1) 
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.2 
 
353 
therefore provides for a rather short three-year limitation period starting 
the day after the obligee knows or ought to know the facts on which its 
right is based and this right can be exercised. Paragraph (2) provides for 
a ten-year maximum limitation period, commencing at the time when 
the right can be exercised, regardless of the obligee’s actual or 
constructive knowledge. 
5. Right can be exercised 
The obligee has a real possibility to exercise its right only if it has 
become due and can be enforced. Paragraph (2) therefore provides that 
the maximum limitation period starts only at such date. 
6. Knowledge of the facts as distinguished from knowledge of the 
law 
The general three-year limitation period starts the day after the day 
“the obligee knows or ought to know the facts as a result of which the 
obligee’s right can be exercised”. “Facts” within the meaning of this 
provision are the facts on which the right is based, such as the formation 
of a contract, the delivery of goods, the undertaking of services, and 
non-performance. The facts indicating that a right or claim has fallen 
due must be known or at least knowable by the obligee before the 
general limitation period starts. The identity of the obligor may also be 
in doubt, e.g. in cases of agency, the transfer of debts or entire contracts, 
the winding-up of companies, or unclear third-party beneficiary 
contracts. In these cases, the obligee must know or have reason to know 
whom to sue before it can be blamed for not having pursued the right or 
claim. Actual or constructive knowledge of “facts”, however, does not 
mean that the obligee must know the legal implications of the facts. If, 
despite full knowledge of the facts, the obligee is mistaken about its 
rights, the three-year limitation period may nevertheless start to run. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1.  
A designs and builds a bridge under a contract with county B. 
A’s engineers make a mistake in calculating the strength of some 
steel girders. Four years later, the bridge collapses due to a 
combination of the weight of some heavy trucks and a storm. B’s 
claims for damages are not barred, because the general limitation 
period started only at the time of the collapse, when B was in a 
position to discover A’s breach. 
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the bridge 
collapses eleven years after its construction. B’s claims are barred 
under the maximum limitation period under Article 10.2(2). Parties 
Art. 10.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
354 
to such a contract are well advised to adjust the maximum period 
while remaining within the limits of Article 10.3. 
3.  
A sends B a notice under Article 7.3.2 terminating a sales 
contract between A and B because B refuses to take delivery of 
goods tendered by A. Thirty-seven months after receipt of the note of 
termination, B demands the return of an advance on the purchase 
price paid prior to the termination, asserting that, due to an error in 
its bookkeeping, it had overlooked its payment of the advance with 
the consequence that it had only recently become aware of the claim 
for restitution it had under Article 7.3.6(1). B’s claim for restitution 
is barred by the three-year limitation period, as B ought to have 
known of its payment when the contract was terminated and the 
claim to repay the advance arose. 
4.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B asserts 
that it had not realised the legal effects of a notice of termination. B’s 
claim for restitution is nevertheless barred. An error of law with 
regard to the legal effects of a notice of termination cannot absolve 
the obligee since “ought to know” includes seeking legal advice if 
the party is uncertain about the legal effects of the circumstances. 
7. Day of commencement 
Since, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the obligor can 
normally perform its obligation in the course of the whole day of the 
debt’s maturity, the limitation period does not start on that same day but 
only on the following day. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
5.  
A is obliged to pay a sum of money on 24 November. If A does 
not pay by that date, the limitation period starts on 25 November. 
8. Right must be exercisable 
An obligation may exist even if performance cannot as yet be 
required (see, e.g., Article 6.1.1(a)). While a creditor’s claim to the 
repayment of a loan is founded on the contract and may therefore arise 
at the time of the conclusion of the contract or of the payment of the 
loan to the debtor, the repayment claim will usually fall due much later. 
Furthermore, a right may not be enforceable if the obligor has a defence.

6.  
A loan agreement obliges the borrower to repay the loan on 15 
November. The lender grants the borrower an extension of the date 
of repayment until 15 December. The limitation period starts on 16 
December.  
7.  
A contracts to build a fertiliser plant for B. The price is to be 
paid in three instalments, the last instalment being due four weeks 
after completion of the work as certified by an engineering firm. 
After certification there are still malfunctionings of the plant. B is 
entitled to withhold performance of the last instalment under Articles 
7.1.3(2) and 7.1.4(4). The limitation period for the claim for payment 
does not begin until the right to withhold payment is extinguished by 
cure of the malfunctionings.  
9. Maximum period 
Under paragraph (2) the obligee is in any event, i.e. irrespective of 
whether it knew or ought to have known the facts giving rise to its right, 
prevented from exercising the right ten years after it could have 
exercised it. The objectives of this maximum period of ten years are the 
restoration of peace and the prevention of speculative litigation where 
evidence has faded. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
8.  
B borrows money from A and orders its accountant to repay the 
loan when repayment falls due in January. Fifteen years later, a 
dispute arises over whether the loan was repaid fully or only in part 
as A claims. A’s asserted claim is barred by Article 10.2(2), because 
the maximum limitation period has expired. 
10. Ancillary claims 
This Article applies to all rights, including so-called “ancillary 
claims”. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
9.  
In a loan agreement, the borrower agrees to pay an interest of 
0.7% per month if there is default in repayment. Thirty-five months 
after repayment is due, the borrower repays the principal. The lender 
need not sue for all successive monthly instalments of interest at 
once, but can wait up to thirty-six months for each instalment before 
it is barred.  
Art. 10.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
356 
10.  Under the contract of builder A with owner B, A agrees to 
complete construction by 1 October and to pay EUR 50,000 for 
every month of delay up to a maximum amount of EUR 2,500,000. 
Completion is delayed for 40 months. Claims for damages for non-
performance or delay are barred 36 months after 2 October. The 
claim for the penalty for each month of delay is barred 36 months 
after it arises. 
11. “Year” 
This Article does not provide a definition of “year”, because at 
international level a reference to “year” is usually understood as being a 
reference to the Gregorian calendar (see Article 1(3)(h) of the UN 
Limitation Convention). In any event, calendars deviating from the 
Gregorian calendar will in most cases have the same number of days per 
year, with the consequence that they do not influence the length of 
limitation periods. A different meaning of “year” can be agreed upon by 
the parties under Article 1.5. Such an agreement may be explicit or 
derived from an interpretation of the contract. 
ARTICLE  10.3 
(Modification of limitation periods by the parties) 
(1) The parties may modify the limitation 
periods. 
(2) However they may not  
(a) shorten the general limitation period to 
less than one year; 
(b) shorten the maximum limitation period 
to less than four years; 
(c) extend the maximum limitation period 
to more than fifteen years. 
COMMENT  
1. Basic decision: modifications possible 
In some legal systems the power of the parties to modify limitation 
periods and their effects is restricted out of concern for the weaker 
parties and, in particular, consumers. A distinction is sometimes made 
between very short limitation periods, which can be prolonged, and 
other limitation periods, which cannot be modified or can only be 
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.3 
 
357 
shortened. Since the Principles apply to international contracts between 
businesspersons who are normally experienced and knowledgeable 
persons who do not need to be protected, they permit the parties to adapt 
the limitation periods applicable to the rights arising out of their 
contracts to their needs in a given case. Restrictions to the parties’ 
autonomy in this respect may, however, follow from the mandatory 
rules of the otherwise applicable law (see Article 1.4).  
2. Limits of modifications 
The possibility nevertheless remains that a party with superior 
bargaining power or better information may take advantage of the other 
party by either unduly shortening or lengthening the limitation period. 
This Article therefore limits the power to shorten the general limitation 
period by stating that it may not be shortened to less than one year 
starting from the moment of actual or constructive knowledge, and to 
shorten the maximum period by stating that it may not be shortened to 
less than four years. The maximum limitation period and, necessarily, 
the general period cannot exceed fifteen years. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2 to Article 10.2, except 
that in their contract the parties provide that the maximum limitation 
period for all claims based on hidden defects is fifteen years. B’s 
claim for damages is not yet barred. 
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2 to Article 10.2, except 
that in their contract the parties provide that the maximum limitation 
period for all claims based on hidden defects is twenty-five years and 
the bridge collapsed after sixteen years. B’s claim for damages is 
barred, because the maximum limitation period can be extended to 
only fifteen years. 
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2 to Article 10.2, except 
that in their contract the parties provide that the general limitation 
period in case of harm resulting from the non-conformity of the 
bridge starts only upon the submission of a written report of experts 
of an independent engineering firm. After the collapse of the bridge, 
it is uncertain what the causes were, and it takes two years for the 
engineering firm to submit its report. The general limitation period 
begins to run only from the day after the day on which the report was 
submitted. 
Art. 10.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
358 
3. Time of modification 
A modification can be agreed upon before or after the commence-
ment of a limitation period. A modification agreed upon before or after 
the commencement of a limitation period differs from an agreement 
concluded after the limitation period has expired. Such an agreement, 
although too late to modify the applicable limitation period, may have 
legal consequences either as a waiver of the defence that the limitation 
period has expired or as a new promise by the obligor. 
ARTICLE  10.4 
(New limitation period by acknowledgement) 
(1) Where the obligor before the expiration 
of the general limitation period acknowledges the 
right of the obligee, a new general limitation 
period begins on the day after the day of the 
acknowledgement. 
(2) The maximum limitation period does 
not begin to run again, but may be exceeded by 
the beginning of a new general limitation period 
under Article 10.2(1).  
COMMENT 
1. Acknowledgement of rights  
Most legal systems permit the running of the limitation period to be 
altered by acts of the parties or other circumstances. Sometimes acts of 
the parties or other circumstances “interrupt” the running of the 
limitation period, with the effect that a new limitation period starts. 
Sometimes acts or other circumstances cause a “suspension” of the 
running of the limitation period, with the effect that the period of 
suspension is not counted in computing the limitation period. According 
to this Article the acknowledgement of a right by the obligor causes an 
interruption of the limitation period (see also Article 20 of the UN 
Limitation Convention,). 
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.4 
 
359 
2. Commencement of a new general limitation period 
The new limitation period that starts following acknowledgement of 
the right of the obligee is the general limitation period, because by 
virtue of such an acknowledgement the obligee will necessarily possess 
the knowledge required for commencement of the limitation period 
under Article 10.2(1). There is therefore no need to protect the obligee 
by granting it a new maximum limitation period. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A defectively performs a construction contract with B and B 
informs A of the non-conformities in October without receiving any 
response from A. Two years later B again approaches A, threatening 
to bring an action for damages. This time A responds and 
acknowledges the non-conformity of its performance and promises 
to cure the non-conformity. On the following day a new general 
limitation period starts to run for B’s right to damages.  
The commencement of a new general limitation period following 
acknowledgement can take place either during the general limitation 
period under Article 10.2(1), or during the maximum limitation period 
under Article 10.2(2). While the maximum limitation period will not in 
itself begin again, the new general limitation period may exceed the 
maximum period by up to three years if the obligor acknowledges the 
right of the obligee after more than seven years but before the maximum 
period has already expired. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
B discovers defects in the construction work of A only nine 
years after completion of the work. The defects could not have been 
discovered earlier. B threatens to initiate legal action, and A 
acknowledges the defects. A new general limitation period begins to 
run on acknowledgement, so that altogether the limitation period 
amounts to twelve years. 
3. Novation and other acts creating a new obligation 
Acknowledgement does not create a new obligation, it merely 
interrupts the running of the limitation period. Accessory rights are 
therefore not extinguished. Consequently, if the limitation period has 
already ended, a mere acknowledgement under this Article does not 
retroactively remove or invalidate the limitation defence. 
Art. 10.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
360 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2, except that B knows 
or ought to know of A’s defective construction at the time of 
completion. B approaches A only 7 years later, and A acknowledges 
the defective performance. B’s claim is nevertheless already barred 
under Article 10.2(1) and is not revived by A’s acknowledgement. 
If the parties want to undo the effects of a completed limitation 
period, they can create a new obligation by a “novation” or an unilateral 
act on the part of the obligor, or the obligor can waive the defence of the 
expiration of a limitation period. The parties can also prolong the 
duration of the obligee’s right beyond the end of the maximum 
limitation period under Article 10.2(2). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
4. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, except that A, in 
order to maintain a profitable business relation, not only acknow-
ledges the defective performance, but promises to cure the defects 
regardless of any question of A’s liability. This agreement creates a 
new obligation for A, which is barred only three years later. 
5. 
Nine years after completion B discovers defects in A’s 
construction work which could not have been discovered earlier. On 
notice to A, A responds that it will investigate the causes of the 
defects and will therefore not invoke the limitation period until six 
months after the experts investigating the defects submit their report. 
The report is submitted twelve months later, confirming B’s notice 
of defects. When B asks A to cure the defects, A argues that the 
maximum period of Article 10.2(2) has expired with the 
consequence that no claim for damages can be made by B. A’s 
argument is incorrect if B abstained from initiating judicial 
proceedings on account of A’s waiver. 
4. Interruption of limitation periods modified by the parties 
To the extent that the parties have modified the general limitation 
period under Article 10.2(1), acknowledgement and the commencement 
of a new limitation period affect the general period as modified. If, for 
example, the parties have shortened the general limitation period to one 
year, acknowledgement causes a new one-year period to run.  
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.5 
 
361 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
6. 
A and B have agreed to shorten the limitation period for claims 
arising from the non-conformity of A’s performance to two years. 
After nine and a half years B discovers defects in A’s performance, 
and A acknowledges its obligation to cure. B has another two years to 
pursue its claim before it is barred under Article 10.2(1). 
Since the obligor can acknowledge more than once, the limited effect 
of an acknowledgement that causes only the general limitation period to 
start again can be overcome by a subsequent acknowledgement. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
7. 
A delivers non-conforming goods to B in November. B suffers 
loss resulting from the non-conformity because its customers complain 
and return the goods. Since two years later the total amount of loss is 
not yet clear, B pressures A to acknowledge its liability and in 
December of that year A complies with B’s request. Two years later, 
there are still uncertainties regarding the exact extent of B’s 
obligations towards its customers, some of whom have sued for 
compensation for consequential damages allegedly caused by the 
goods. B therefore turns to A again, who acknowledges its obligation 
to compensate B should the claims of B’s customers be well-founded. 
B has three more years before its claims against A are barred.  
ARTICLE  10.5 
(Suspension by judicial proceedings) 
(1) The running of the limitation period is 
suspended 
(a) when the obligee performs any act, by 
commencing judicial proceedings or in judicial 
proceedings already instituted, that is recognised 
by the law of the court as asserting the obligee’s 
right against the obligor; 
(b) in the case of the obligor’s insolvency 
when the obligee has asserted its rights in the 
insolvency proceedings; or 
(c) in the case of proceedings for disso-
lution of the entity which is the obligor when the 
obligee has asserted its rights in the dissolution 
proceedings. 
Art. 10.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
362 
(2) Suspension lasts until a final decision 
has been issued or until the proceedings have 
been otherwise terminated. 
COMMENT 
1. Judicial proceedings 
In all legal systems judicial proceedings affect the running of a 
limitation period in either of two manners. Judicial proceedings can 
cause an interruption of the limitation period, so that a new limitation 
period begins when the judicial proceedings end. Alternatively, judicial 
proceedings can cause only a suspension, so that a period that has 
already lapsed before the judicial proceedings began will be deducted 
from the applicable period, the remaining period starting at the end of 
the judicial procedure. This Article adopts the latter solution (see also 
Article 13 of the UN Limitation Convention). 
2. Commencement of proceedings 
The requirements for the commencement of judicial proceedings are 
determined by the law of procedure of the court where the proceedings 
are instituted. The law of procedure of the forum also determines 
whether the raising of counterclaims amounts to the instituting of 
judicial proceedings in regard to these claims: where the counterclaims 
raised as a defence are treated as if they were brought in separate 
proceedings, raising them has the same effect on the limitation period as 
if they had been filed independently. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
A purchases from B a truck that turns out to be defective. A 
notifies B of the defects but, because of other pending contracts 
between A and B, A does not press the matter for 24 months. When 
the negotiations between A and B on the other contracts break down, 
B turns down a request by A to cure the defects, asserting that the 
defects were caused by A’s mishandling of the truck. A files a law 
suit against B by depositing it with the clerk of the competent court. 
Under the procedural law applicable in that court, this is sufficient to 
initiate litigation with respect to A’s claims. The running of the 
limitation period is suspended, until a final decision is handed down. 
This includes not only a decision of the court of first instance, but 
also, if appeal is allowed, that of a higher court on any available 
appeal. If the parties reach a settlement or the plaintiff withdraws
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.6 
 
363 
its complaint, this ends the litigation if it is so regarded under the 
applicable domestic procedural law.  
2. 
B initiates litigation for the purchase price of goods by filing a 
complaint as required by the procedural law of the country of the 
competent court. A raises claims under an asserted guarantee either 
as counterclaims or by way of set-off. The limitation period for A’s 
warranty claims is suspended until there is a final decision on the 
counterclaims or a settlement or withdrawal of A’s counterclaims. 
3. Termination 
“Termination” by a final decision or otherwise is to be determined by 
the rules of procedure of the forum. These rules decide when a decision 
is final and therefore brings the litigation on the litigated subject-matter 
to an end. These rules also have to decide whether and when the 
litigation comes to an end without a final decision on the merits, e.g. by 
the withdrawal of a complaint or by a settlement of the parties. 
4. Suspension by insolvency or dissolution proceedings 
For the purpose of this Article, insolvency and dissolution 
proceedings are regarded as judicial proceedings (Article 10.5(1)(b) and 
(c)). The dates of the commencement and ending of these proceedings 
are determined by the law governing the proceedings. 
ARTICLE  10.6 
(Suspension by arbitral proceedings) 
(1) The running of the limitation period is 
suspended when the obligee performs any act, by 
commencing arbitral proceedings or in arbitral 
proceedings already instituted, that is recognised 
by the law of the arbitral tribunal as asserting the 
obligee’s right against the obligor. In the absence 
of regulations for arbitral proceedings or 
provisions determining the exact date of the 
commencement of arbitral proceedings, the 
proceedings are deemed to commence on the date 
on which a request that the right in dispute 
should be adjudicated reaches the obligor. 
Art. 10.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
364 
(2) Suspension 
lasts 
until 
a 
binding 
decision has been issued or until the proceedings 
have been otherwise terminated. 
COMMENT 
1. Arbitral proceedings 
Arbitration has the same effect as judicial proceedings. The 
commencement of arbitral proceedings therefore has the same 
suspensive effect as judicial proceedings. In general, the date of 
commencement is determined by the applicable arbitration rules and the 
starting point of suspension is also determined by these rules. For cases 
in which the rules on arbitration do not exactly determine the date of 
commencement of the proceedings, the second sentence of paragraph 
(1) of this Article provides a default rule. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
A cancels a distributorship contract with B, claiming that B has 
defaulted payments due for A’s delivery of goods to B. B 
counterclaims damages for lost profits, but B changes its law firm 
and allows almost 30 months to pass from the termination of the 
agreement. The agreement contains an arbitration clause, providing 
that all disputes and claims “shall be settled under the Rules of 
Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of 
Commerce”, and B submits a request for arbitration under those 
rules. The rules provide that the date of receipt of the request is to be 
regarded “for all purposes” as the date of the commencement of the 
arbitral proceedings. The running of the limitation period is 
suspended until a final award is handed down or the case is 
otherwise disposed of.  
2. Termination of arbitration 
While the most frequent cases of termination will, as in judicial 
proceedings, be those that end with a decision on the merits of the case, 
arbitration can also end otherwise, e.g. by the withdrawal of an 
application, by a settlement or by an order or injunction of the 
competent court. The applicable rules on arbitration and civil procedure 
have to determine whether or not such events terminate the arbitration 
and thereby also the suspension. 
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.7 
 
365 
ARTICLE  10.7 
(Alternative dispute resolution) 
The provisions of Articles 10.5 and 10.6 
apply with appropriate modifications to other 
proceedings whereby the parties request a third 
person to assist them in their attempt to reach an 
amicable settlement of their dispute. 
COMMENT 
1. Alternative dispute resolution 
Before resorting to judicial proceedings or arbitration, parties may 
start negotiations or agree on conciliation or other forms of alternative 
dispute resolution.  
Under the Principles negotiations do not automatically suspend the 
limitation period. Parties who want the limitation period to be 
suspended should come to an express agreement to this effect. 
By contrast, this Article provides that conciliation and other forms of 
alternative dispute resolution cause a suspension of the limitation 
period. The definition of “alternative dispute resolution” as proceedings 
whereby the parties request a third person to assist them in their attempt 
to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute, is inspired by Article 
1(3) of the 2002 UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial 
Conciliation. 
2. Absence of statutory regulations 
As only few countries have enacted statutes on alternative dispute 
resolution and rules for such proceedings are relatively rare, this Article 
refers to the provisions on judicial and arbitral proceedings, which have 
to be applied with “appropriate modifications”. This means that, in the 
absence of an applicable legal regulation, the commencement of 
proceedings of alternative dispute resolution is governed by the default 
provision in the second sentence of Article 10.6(1), the proceedings 
starting on the date on which one party’s request to have such 
proceedings reaches the other party. Since the end of a dispute 
resolution procedure will very often be uncertain, the reference to 
Articles 10.5 and 10.6, and in particular to the phrase “until the 
proceedings have been otherwise terminated” in their paragraphs (2), is 
also to be applied with appropriate modifications. Thus, a unilateral 
termination of the dispute resolution procedure by one of the parties
Art. 10.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
366 
will suffice to terminate the suspension. A unilateral termination that is 
made in bad faith is subject to Article 1.7.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
The parties, a hospital and a supplier of hospital equipment, agree to 
submit disputes over prices to a board of mediation. Under the 
applicable rules a review by this board starts on the date on which 
one party submits a complaint to the other party, who then has to 
invite the board to review the case under the applicable rules. The 
mediation ends either when the board decides on the claim, or there 
is a settlement between the parties, or the claimant’s request is 
withdrawn.  
ARTICLE  10.8 
(Suspension in case of force majeure,  
death or incapacity) 
(1) Where the obligee has been prevented 
by an impediment that is beyond its control and 
that it could neither avoid nor overcome, from 
causing a limitation period to cease to run under 
the preceding Articles, the general limitation 
period is suspended so as not to expire before one 
year after the relevant impediment has ceased to 
exist.  
(2) Where the impediment consists of the 
incapacity or death of the obligee or obligor, 
suspension ceases when a representative for the 
incapacitated or deceased party or its estate has 
been appointed or a successor has inherited the 
respective party’s position. The additional one-
year 
period 
under 
paragraph 
(1) 
applies 
accordingly. 
COMMENT 
1. Effects of impediments  
Most legal systems take into account impediments that prevent the 
obligee from pursuing its rights in court, as does the UN Limitation 
Convention (see Articles 15 and 21). It is a basic policy concept that 
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.8 
 
367 
the obligee must have the possibility to pursue its rights before it can be 
deprived of them as a result of the lapse of time. Practical examples of 
impediments include war and natural disasters that prevent the obligee 
from reaching a competent court. Other cases of force majeure may also 
prevent the pursuance of a right and at least cause the suspension of the 
limitation period. The impediment must be beyond the obligee’s control. 
Imprisonment, therefore, would suspend the limitation period only 
where it could not have been avoided, such as in the case of a prisoner 
of war, but the imprisonment of a criminal would not. Only the general 
limitation period is suspended, however. If the maximum period has 
elapsed before the obligee could pursue this right, the obligee is subject 
to the defence of the expiration of the maximum limitation period. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A’s lawyer plans to file a complaint against B, an engineering 
firm, for alleged professional malpractice by B’s employees. The 
limitation period will expire on 1 December, and A’s lawyer has 
completed the complaint on 25 November, intending to file it by 
express mail or in person with the clerk of the competent court. On 
24 November, terrorists attack A’s country with biological weapons 
of mass destruction, causing all traffic, mail service, and other social 
services to completely cease, thus preventing the timely filing of A’s 
complaint. The limitation period ceases to run and will not expire 
until one year after some means of communication has been restored 
in A’s country. If, however, the disruption of all means of 
communication in A’s country lasts ten years, A’s right is barred by 
the maximum limitation period. 
2. Additional period of deliberation 
Since impediments beyond the control of the obligee may occur and 
cease to exist towards the end of the limitation period, it is possible that 
after the ceasing of the impediment only a very short time or no time at 
all might be left for the obligee to decide what to do. This Article 
therefore provides for an additional one-year period of time from the 
date on which the impediment ceases to exist with a view to enabling 
the obligee to decide what course of action to take. 
3.  Incapacity and death 
Incapacity and death of the obligee or of the obligor are but special 
examples of impediments to an effective pursuance of the obligee’s 
Art. 10.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
368 
right. Paragraph (2) provides for the same solution as in the case of 
general impediments. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A lends B money which is due to be repaid on 1 January. A 
does not seek repayment for a long time and dies thirty-five months 
after the date for repayment. The law of succession applicable to A’s 
estate requires that an administrator appointed by the court 
administer the estate and collect outstanding debts. Since the docket 
of the competent court is overcrowded, it takes two and a half years 
for an administrator to be appointed. The administrator has one 
month left of the three-year general limitation period plus an 
additional one-year period to pursue the deceased party’s claim 
against B before the limitation period expires. 
ARTICLE  10.9 
(Effects of expiration of limitation period) 
(1) The expiration of the limitation period 
does not extinguish the right. 
(2) For the expiration of the limitation 
period to have effect, the obligor must assert it as 
a defence. 
(3) A right may still be relied on as a 
defence even though the expiration of the 
limitation period for that right has been asserted. 
COMMENT 
1. No extinction of the right 
The expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the 
obligor’s right, but only bars its enforcement. 
2. Expiration of the limitation period must be raised as a defence 
The effects of the expiration of the limitation period do not occur 
automatically. They only occur if the obligor raises the expiration as a 
defence. The obligor can do so in any proceedings in accordance with 
the applicable law, and also outside of proceedings by invoking the 
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.10 
 
369 
expiration of the limitation period. The existence of the defence can also 
be the subject of a declaratory judgement. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1. 
A purchases goods from B. Part of the purchase price is due on 
1 April and is not paid. Thirty-eight months later, B files a complaint 
against A. A does not invoke the expiration of the limitation period, 
nor does it appear in court, and B moves for a default-judgment. 
Judgment will be for B, since A did not raise the expiration of the 
limitation period as a defence. 
3. Use of a time-barred right as a defence 
Since under the Principles the expiration of a limitation period does 
not extinguish the right, but only gives a defence that must be asserted 
by the obligor (paragraphs (1) and (2)), it follows that the obligee’s right 
still exists, although a claim for its performance may be barred by the 
obligor’s assertion of the expiration of the limitation period. It can, 
therefore, be used as a defence, e.g. as grounds for the retention of 
performance by the obligee (paragraph (3)). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
A leases a printing press to B for ten years. Under the contract 
A is obliged to maintain the press in working condition and to 
undertake repairs, unless a defect is caused by B’s negligence in 
operating the machine. The machine breaks down, but A refuses to 
do the necessary repairs. B, after futile requests and negotiations 
with A, has the repairs done by another company and asks A to pay 
the necessary costs. A does not react, and B does not pursue the 
matter. Five years later, at the end of the lease, B again requests 
payment of the costs of the repairs. A refuses to pay and invokes 
Article 10.2(1), requesting the return of the printing press. B is 
entitled to damages for breach of contract and to withhold delivery 
of the press. 
ARTICLE  10.10 
(Right of set-off) 
The obligee may exercise the right of set-off 
until the obligor has asserted the expiration of the 
limitation period. 
Art. 10.11 
UNIDROIT Principles 
370 
COMMENT 
As the obligee’s right continues to exist, it can be used for set-off if 
the prerequisites of set-off under Article 8.1 are met. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
1. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2 to Article 10.9, except 
that A not only asks for the return of the press, but also for the 
payment of the unpaid rent. B is entitled to set off its counterclaim 
for damages against this monetary claim despite the expiration of the 
limitation period.  
Although the expiration of the limitation period does not in itself 
extinguish the right of the obligee, the situation changes when the 
obligor invokes the time bar as a defence by asserting it against the 
obligee. By so doing, the obligor makes the limitation period effective, 
with the consequence that the right can no longer be enforced. Since set-
off may be considered the self-enforcement of a right, it is not available 
after the defence of the expiration of the limitation period has been 
invoked. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B 
requests the payment of damages and threatens to sue four years 
after having had the repairs done. A objects, asserting that the 
machine broke down due to B’s fault. Since this is hard to prove, A 
in a letter to B also invokes the time bar under Article 10.2(1). B can 
no longer set off its claim for damages. 
ARTICLE  10.11 
(Restitution) 
Where there has been performance in order 
to discharge an obligation, there is no right of 
restitution merely because the limitation period 
has expired.  
COMMENT 
1. Time-barred claim as valid basis for performance 
Another consequence of the fact that under the Principles the 
expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the right of the 
 
Limitation Periods 
Art. 10.11 
 
371 
obligee but can only be asserted as a defence, is that if the obligor 
performs despite its defence, the obligation it performs remains effective 
as a legal basis for the obligee’s retaining the performance. Mere 
expiration of a limitation period cannot be used as grounds for an action 
to reclaim the performance under restitutionary or unjust enrichment 
principles. 
2. Restitutionary claims based on other grounds 
Despite the lapse of the limitation period, a restitutionary claim can 
be based on grounds other than performance, e.g. where a payor claims 
to have paid a non-existing debt due to a mistake. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1. 
Bank B lends money to borrower A, who does not repay on the 
date required by the loan agreement. A’s debt is overlooked and 
forgotten because of a book-keeping error on the part of B. Four 
years later, B discovers its error and sends A a notice claiming 
repayment. A complies with this request, but later learns from a 
lawyer that it could have refused repayment on account of the 
expiration of the limitation period. A cannot reclaim the payment as 
unjust enrichment from B.  
2. 
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that A has in 
fact repaid the loan, but both sides are unaware of this. Four years 
later, B erroneously requests payment from A, and A complies. A 
can recover the second payment because A has already paid a debt 
which has thus been extinguished by full performance.

CHAPTER  11 
 
 
 
PLURALITY OF OBLIGORS 
AND OF OBLIGEES 
 
 
 
SECTION  1: PLURALITY OF OBLIGORS 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  11.1.1 
(Definitions) 
When several obligors are bound by the 
same obligation towards an obligee: 
(a)  the obligations are joint and several 
when each obligor is bound for the whole 
obligation;  
(b)  the obligations are separate when each 
obligor is bound only for its share. 
COMMENT 
This Chapter deals with situations where an obligation binds several 
obligors or gives rights to several obligees.  
Section 1 concerns the plurality of obligors.  
1.  Several obligors 
There are frequent cases when an obligation binds several obligors. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1.  
Companies A, B and C decide to join efforts to penetrate a new 
market abroad. They need financing and they obtain a loan together 
from bank X. A, B and C are co-obligors of the obligation to 
reimburse the loan. 
2.  
Contractors A and B are awarded a contract for the construction 
of a bridge based on a submission they have filed together. A and B 
are co-obligors of the obligation to build the bridge. 
 
Plurality of Obligors 
Art. 11.1.1 
 
373 
3.  
A large industrial plant has to be insured against fire and other 
hazards. The risk is too large for the capacity of any single insurer. 
Several insurers co-insure the risk. These insurers are co-obligors of 
the obligation to cover the risk. 
4.  
Bank X grants a loan to company A but requires a guarantee. 
Parent company B agrees to bind itself together with A for the 
reimbursement of the loan. A and B are co-obligors of the obligation 
to reimburse the loan. 
2.  The same obligation 
This Section only applies if the different obligors are bound by the 
same obligation.  
It also frequently happens that several obligors are involved in the 
same operation, but with distinct obligations. They are not co-obligors 
under the Articles of this Section. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5.  
A new aeroplane is being built. Many sub-contractors are 
involved in the various elements. For instance, sub-contractor A is in 
charge of profiling the wings and sub-contractor B of studying the 
electronic equipment. Their respective obligations are different. 
They are not “co-obligors”.  
The “same obligation” usually, but not necessarily, arises from a 
single contract. In Illustrations 1 and 2, there will normally be a single 
loan contract, or a single construction contract binding the different 
obligors. However, in the case of co-insurance (Illustration 3), it is 
frequent that each insurer, even though undertaking to cover the same 
risk, has its own distinct contract with the insured. The guarantee 
offered in Illustration 4 will often be granted in a distinct contract. Other 
examples of obligations undertaken by a different contract are cases in 
which obligations are transferred by agreement (see Article 9.2.1 et 
seq.). 
However, the obligations concerned must be contractual, irrespective 
of whether they arise from a single contract or out of several contracts. 
Tortious obligations of multiple tortfeasors are not governed by this 
Chapter, since the Principles govern international commercial contracts. 
Contractual damage claims may fall under this Chapter. 
Art. 11.1.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
374 
3.  Two main types of obligation 
Article 11.1.1 defines the two main types of obligation which exist in 
practice when several obligors are bound by the same obligation 
towards an obligee. 
The first is where each obligor is bound for the whole obligation, 
which means that the obligee may require performance from any one of 
them (see Article 11.1.3), subject to contributory claims between the 
obligors at a later stage (see Article 11.1.10). 
The second is where each obligor is bound only for its share, which 
entitles the obligee to claim only that much from each of the obligors. 
In the former situation, which is the default rule (see Article 11.1.2), 
obligations are called “joint and several”. In the latter situation, 
obligations are called “separate”. 
Whether co-obligors are jointly and severally, or separately bound is 
determined in accordance with Article 11.1.2 (see Illustrations 1 to 4). 
4.  Other possible situations 
The two main types of obligation illustrated above are the most 
common, but this Section does not intend to cover all possible 
arrangements. 
Other situations which can occur are those of so-called “joint” or 
“communal” obligations, in which the obligors are bound to render 
performance together and the obligee may claim performance only from 
all of them together. A typical example is that of a group of musicians 
having undertaken to perform a string quartet. Situations of this type are 
of less practical importance.  
ARTICLE  11.1.2  
(Presumption of joint and several obligations) 
When several obligors are bound by the 
same obligation towards an obligee, they are 
presumed to be jointly and severally bound, 
unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
 
Plurality of Obligors 
Art. 11.1.2 
 
375 
COMMENT 
1.  Default rule 
In commercial practice the normal case is that several obligors that 
have undertaken the same obligation are jointly and severally bound 
towards the obligee. This justifies the default rule expressed in Article 
11.1.2. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Companies A, B and C have together obtained a loan from 
bank X (as in Illustration 1 under Article 11.1.1). The loan contract 
fails to indicate how each of the parties is bound. They are presumed 
to be joint and several obligors, i.e. towards the bank each of them is 
bound for the whole amount of the loan. 
2.  Circumstances indicating otherwise 
The presumption of joint and several obligations is rebutted when the 
circumstances indicate otherwise. This will often be the result of an 
explicit contractual provision to the contrary. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
Insurers A, B and C have agreed to co-insure an industrial plant 
(as in Illustration 3 under Article 11.1.1). The scheme provides that 
each co-insurer is only bound for a percentage of the risk.  
Other circumstances can also discard the presumption that plural 
obligors are jointly and severally bound. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2, but insurers A, B and 
C have omitted to stipulate that they are not jointly and severally 
bound. However, the very purpose of co-insurance is to cover large 
risks without putting any insurer beyond the limits of its own 
capacity. This may be considered as a circumstance indicating that 
A, B and C are only bound for their respective shares.  
3.  Suretyship and joint and several obligations 
A different situation is that of suretyship, an accessory agreement by 
which a person binds itself for another already bound, in case the main 
obligor defaults. The surety is not bound as a principal, but will only
Art. 11.1.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
376 
have to perform if the main obligor fails to do so. Principal and surety 
are bound separately – and in a successive order. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4.  
Company A wants to borrow EUR 1,000,000 from bank X. The 
loan is granted on the condition that parent company B will act as 
surety for reimbursement of the loan. A is X’s main obligor. B will 
be required to pay only if and when A defaults.  
It may happen that the technique of joint and several obligations is 
used as a mechanism by which the economic benefit of suretyship may 
be obtained. The obligee requests the company willing to guarantee the 
initial obligor’s obligation to intervene next to the latter as a joint and 
several obligor, instead of entering into a separate agreement of 
suretyship. The obligee’s advantage is that in such a case, it can require 
payment directly from the intervening company. This does not 
necessarily deprive the intervening company of the special rights 
provided to a surety under the law of suretyship. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 4, but X requires B to 
bind itself as a joint and several obligor, next to A, for 
reimbursement of the loan. X may then require reimbursement 
directly from B as well as from A. 
This particular use of the technique of joint and several obligations 
has some specific consequences: see Comment 3 on Article 11.1.9, 
concerning apportionment among joint and several obligors. The law of 
suretyship may, of course, provide additional consequences. 
ARTICLE  11.1.3  
(Obligee’s rights against joint  
and several obligors) 
When obligors are jointly and severally 
bound, the obligee may require performance 
from any one of them, until full performance has 
been received.

377 
COMMENT 
The main effect of joint and several obligations from the obligors’ 
point of view has already been stated in the definition given in Article 
11.1.1, namely that each obligor is bound for the whole obligation. 
Article 11.1.3 states the main effect for the obligee: it may require 
performance from each obligor, until full performance has been 
received. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1.  
Farmers A, B and C have bought a tractor together, for shared 
use in their respective fields. They are jointly and severally bound to 
pay the price of USD 45,000. Seller X may require payment of the 
whole sum from A, B or C. X’s claim is extinguished when it has 
received full performance, from one or more of its obligors. 
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. A pays only USD 
30,000 (in spite of being bound for USD 45,000). X, while still 
retaining a claim against A for the unpaid part, may claim that 
amount of USD 15,000 from B or C. If X, at this stage, only receives 
USD 10,000 from B (though B was still bound for USD 15,000), X 
may still claim USD 5,000 from C, as well as from A and B. 
ARTICLE  11.1.4 
(Availability of defences and rights of set-off) 
A joint and several obligor against whom a 
claim is made by the obligee may assert all the 
defences and rights of set-off that are personal to 
it or that are common to all the co-obligors, but 
may not assert defences or rights of set-off that 
are personal to one or several of the other co-
obligors. 
COMMENT 
This Article deals with the possibilities for a joint and several obligor 
to assert different defences and rights of set-off. It distinguishes 
between, on one side, defences and rights of set-off that are personal to 
one of the obligors or common to all of them, and, on the other side, 
defences and rights of set-off which are personal to one or several of the 
other co-obligors. 
Art. 11.1.5 
UNIDROIT Principles 
378 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1.  
Together, companies A, B and C have purchased machinery 
from manufacturer X, to be used in their respective plants for a 
common project. Part of the purchase price has to be paid at a future 
date, the outstanding amount being jointly and severally due. A has 
obtained a separate undertaking from X that the machinery would 
meet a certain performance level. If X requires A to pay the 
outstanding amount of the price, A may assert the fact that the 
machinery does not meet the guaranteed level of performance. On 
the other hand, if X claims payment from B and C, the latter may not 
assert that the level of performance is insufficient, since the defence 
is personal to A. 
2.  
Companies A and B jointly and severally have undertaken to 
purchase a certain quantity of steel from seller X. Government 
authorities in the buyers’ country declare an embargo on all trade 
with the seller’s country, which renders performance of the contract 
unlawful. This is a common defence which each of the co-obligors 
may assert against X. 
3.  
Bank X has lent EUR 2,000,000 to joint and several obligors A 
and B. As a result of the selling of shares belonging to A on the stock 
market, X becomes A’s obligor for an amount of EUR 500,000. A 
may exercise its right of set-off against X, with the effects provided 
for in Article 11.1.5. On the contrary, B may not assert this right, 
which is personal to A.   
ARTICLE  11.1.5  
(Effect of performance or set-off) 
Performance or set-off by a joint and 
several obligor or set-off by the obligee against 
one joint and several obligor discharges the other 
obligors in relation to the obligee to the extent of 
the performance or set-off.  
COMMENT 
1.  Performance by a joint and several obligor 
If one of the co-obligors has already fully or partially performed the 
obligation, the other obligors may successfully assert this as a defence 
 
Plurality of Obligors 
Art. 11.1.5 
 
379 
should the obligee still attempt to claim performance from the other co-
obligors. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
1.  
Companies A, B and C are jointly bound to reimburse a loan of 
EUR 100,000. Upon lender X’s request, A fully reimburses the loan. 
B and C can avail themselves of A’s performance if X still claims 
reimbursement of the loan from them.  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, but A only 
reimburses EUR 30,000. B and C are still jointly and severally 
bound for EUR 70,000 (see Article 11.1.3), but they may invoke A’s 
partial payment if X still claims the full amount from them. 
2.  Set-off 
The rule laid down in this Article with respect to performance by one 
of the co-obligors also applies, with appropriate adaptations, in the case 
of set-off between the obligee and one of the obligors. Rights of set-off 
have already been mentioned in Article 11.1.4, where the issue is to 
determine which of the co-obligors could assert rights of set-off. Article 
11.1.5 deals with the subsequent issue of the effects of set-off, once it 
has been exercised. On the rules governing set-off itself, see Articles 8.1 
to 8.5. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
The facts are the same as in the preceding illustrations: A, B 
and C are jointly bound to reimburse a loan of EUR 100,000 to X. 
However, on the basis of a different transaction A has become X’s 
obligee for an amount of EUR 60,000. If A exercises its right of set-
off against X by serving appropriate notice (as provided in Article 
8.3), it will have the same effect as partial performance by A of its 
joint and several obligation, thus discharging B and C for the 
corresponding amount. 
The same rule applies if the right of set-off has been exercised by the 
obligee against one of the joint and several obligors. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, but it is X who takes 
the initiative to give the set-off notice to A. The effects are identical. 
A is discharged for the amount of set-off (EUR 60,000), and the 
other co-obligors B and C are also discharged for the same amount. 
Art. 11.1.6 
UNIDROIT Principles 
380 
ARTICLE  11.1.6  
(Effect of release or settlement) 
(1)  Release of one joint and several 
obligor, or settlement with one joint and several 
obligor, discharges all the other obligors for the 
share of the released or settling obligor, unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise. 
(2)  When the other obligors are dis-
charged for the share of the released obligor, they 
no longer have a contributory claim against the 
released obligor under Article 11.1.10. 
COMMENT 
1.  Release of one joint and several obligor 
If the obligee releases one of its joint and several obligors with no 
further qualifications, Article 11.1.6 provides as the default rule that the 
release affects only the share of the released obligor, as determined by 
Article 11.1.9. As a consequence, the other obligors are discharged for 
the share of the released obligor only, and remain bound for the 
difference. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Bank X lends EUR 300,000 to companies A, B and C. The 
obligors are jointly and severally bound; their respective contributory 
shares are equal, i.e. EUR 100,000 each. X releases A, with no 
further qualification. The consequence for B and C is that they are 
released for the amount of A’s share of EUR 100,000. B and C 
remain jointly and severally bound towards X for an amount of EUR 
200,000. 
2.  Settlement with one joint and several obligor 
Sometimes the obligee receives payment from one of the co-obligors 
of an amount less than that obligor’s share as determined by Article 1.9, 
as part of a separate settlement with that obligor, pursuant to which the 
payment received is accepted as discharging all of the settling obligor’s 
share. Consequently, the other obligors’ joint and several obligations are 
reduced not only by the amount paid, but by the full initial amount of 
the settling obligor’s share.

2.  
Investors A, B and C are jointly and severally bound to pay 
seller X USD 3,000,000 for an acquisition of shares. A and X come 
to a settlement of different disputes between themselves. One of the 
terms of the settlement is that A will be discharged of its obligations 
towards X under the share purchase agreement by paying an amount 
of USD 600,000, i.e. USD 400,000 less than A’s contributory share 
towards the other co-obligors. Under these circumstances, X may not 
claim the whole remaining USD 2,400,000 against B and C. Their 
joint and several obligations are reduced by the full initial amount of 
A’s share, i.e. USD 1,000,000. They are still jointly and severally 
bound for USD 2,000,000 only.   
3.  Circumstances indicating otherwise 
There can be circumstances where the other obligors are discharged 
for another amount other than that of the released or settling obligor’s 
share. 
For instance, the obligee may release one of its obligors only for part 
of the latter’s share, as determined by Article 11.1.9. The other obligors 
will be discharged only for the amount of that released part. All obligors 
will remain jointly and severally bound for the reduced total amount. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that X 
releases A for an amount of EUR 60,000. The consequence for B and 
C is that they are released for the same amount of EUR 60,000. A, B 
and C remain jointly and severally bound towards X for an amount 
of EUR 240,000. 
On the other hand, the obligee may also intend to fully release all of 
its obligors. If the obligee expresses its intention so to do, Article 11.1.6 
does not apply.  
As to settlement, it will frequently not be separate, but concern all 
joint and several obligors. The consequences for the different obligors’ 
obligations will in these cases be determined by the terms of the 
settlement agreed by all parties, and the contributory claims will be 
adjusted accordingly. 
Art. 11.1.7 
UNIDROIT Principles 
382 
4.  No more contributory claim 
If the obligee has released one of the co-obligors, or settled with it, 
and the other co-obligors have been discharged of the released obligor’s 
share, the other co-obligors have no more contributory claim against the 
released obligor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
4.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1: A is released by X, 
while B and C remain jointly and severally bound for an amount of 
EUR 200,000. If B pays X EUR 200,000, B has a contributory claim 
of EUR 100,000 against C, but no claim against A. 
5.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2: B and C continue to be 
jointly and severally bound for an amount of USD 2,000,000. If B 
pays USD 2,000,000 to X, B has a contributory claim of USD 
1,000,000 against C; but B has no claim against A, even though A has 
paid X only USD 600,000 as agreed in their separate settlement. 
ARTICLE  11.1.7  
(Effect of expiration or suspension  
of limitation period) 
(1)  Expiration of the limitation period of 
the obligee’s rights against one joint and several 
obligor does not affect: 
(a) the obligations to the obligee of the 
other joint and several obligors; or 
(b) the rights of recourse between the joint 
and several obligors under Article 11.1.10.  
(2)  If the obligee initiates proceedings 
under Articles 10.5, 10.6 or 10.7 against one joint 
and several obligor, the running of the limitation 
period is also suspended against the other joint 
and several obligors. 
COMMENT 
1.  Expiration of the limitation period against one obligor 
The obligee’s rights against one (or several) of the joint and several 
obligors may become time-barred. This does not prevent the obligee 
 
Plurality of Obligors 
Art. 11.1.7 
 
383 
from exercising its claim against the other co-obligors whose obligations 
are not yet affected by the expiration of a period of limitation. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Companies A and B are jointly and severally bound to pay 
consultant X fees of USD 500,000 on 1 January. A and B refuse to 
pay, arguing that the services rendered by X were unsatisfactory. The 
parties enter into lengthy discussions. Two years later, in the course 
of the year B comes to acknowledge X’s rights, but A continues to 
challenge them. In March the following year X finally sues both 
clients for payment. More than three years after the date when X’s 
fees were due (see Article 10.2), X’s claim against A is time-barred. 
The situation is different for B, who acknowledged the right of the 
obligee before the expiration of the limitation period, thus triggering 
the running of a new period (see Article 10.4). X can still claim USD 
500,000 from B. 
Co-obligors who have paid the obligee under such circumstances can 
exercise their rights of recourse in accordance with Article 11.1.10, even 
against the co-obligor who could avail itself of the expiration of a period 
of limitation against the obligee, in accordance with Article 10.9. These 
rights of recourse are subject to their own limitation periods. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
In the case described in Illustration 1, B, after paying USD 
500,000 to X, can claim contribution from A under Article 11.1.10. 
2.  Suspension of the limitation period against one obligor 
Initiation by the obligee of legal or arbitral proceedings or an ADR 
procedure against one of the joint and several obligors suspends the 
running of the limitation period against that obligor under Articles 10.5, 
10.6 or 10.7. Article 11.1.7(2) extends the effect of the suspension to the 
other co-obligors. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
Co-buyers A and B are jointly and severally bound to pay seller 
X a sum of GBP 800,000, which was due on 31 December. In spite 
of several reminders, A and B are still in default close to the end of 
the three-year limitation period. On 20 December three years later X 
initiates legal proceedings against A. The limitation period is 
suspended not only against A, but also against B. 
Art. 11.1.8 
UNIDROIT Principles 
384 
The rule in Article 11.1.7(2), which creates effects towards all co-
obligors, adopts an approach different from that in the rule in Article 
11.1.7(1), which provides for individual effects. Indeed, different effects 
are concerned: those of expiration of the limitation period and those of 
initiating legal proceedings. The solution adopted in paragraph (2) saves 
the expenses involved in initiating proceedings against all obligors. The 
obligee should however keep in mind the rule in Article 11.1.8 
concerning effect of judgments. 
ARTICLE 11.1.8  
(Effect of judgment) 
(1)  A decision by a court as to the liability 
to the obligee of one joint and several obligor does 
not affect: 
(a) the obligations to the obligee of the 
other joint and several obligors; or 
(b) the rights of recourse between the joint 
and several obligors under Article 11.1.10.  
(2)  However, the other joint and several 
obligors may rely on such a decision, except if it 
was based on grounds personal to the obligor 
concerned. In such a case, the rights of recourse 
between the joint and several obligors under 
Article 11.1.10 are affected accordingly. 
COMMENT  
1.  No effect on the other obligors’ obligations 
If the obligee commences judicial or arbitral proceedings against 
only one (or some) of the joint and several obligors, any decision by the 
court will not in principle affect the obligations of the co-obligors who 
were not called to court. Whatever the decision, the other obligors will 
still be bound in the original terms. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1.  
Bank C has loaned EUR 1,000,000 to joint and several 
borrowers A and B. A is sued for reimbursement by X and the court 
orders A to pay X EUR 1,000,000. This decision in itself 
 
Plurality of Obligors 
Art. 11.1.8 
 
385 
does not affect B’s obligation; B is still bound to pay EUR 1,000,000 
to X. Naturally, if the judgment is enforced and A pays X EUR 
1,000,000, B’ obligation towards X will be extinguished under 
Article 11.1.5 and B will be subject to A’s contributory recourse 
under Article 11.1.10. 
2.  
Company A and company B have jointly and severally 
undertaken to provide transportation for company X’s deliveries to 
its clients. Performance is defective and X sues A. The court orders 
A to pay damages. B is not bound by that finding of defective 
performance, and its obligations are not increased by the amount of 
the damages. 
2.  No effect on the rights of recourse 
A court decision rendered against one joint and several obligor 
furthermore has no effect on the rights of recourse between the joint and 
several obligors under Article 11.1.10. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2. A pays X the 
damages ordered by the court. A may not claim to recover part of the 
damages from B. 
3.  Right of the other joint and several obligors to avail themselves 
of the decision 
The principle stated in paragraph (1) of this Article does not have to 
be enforced when the other co-obligors find it in their interest to rely on 
the decision. For such cases, paragraph (2) grants the other joint and 
several obligors the right to rely on it. However, the rule does not apply 
when the decision was based on grounds personal to the obligor 
concerned. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
4.  
Art collectors A and B have joined in purchasing a painting at an 
auction and they are jointly and severally bound to pay the price of 
GBP 800,000. The price is not paid and the auction house sues A. The 
court accepts some of A’s arguments concerning the quality of the 
painting, which appears to have been restored, and reduces the price to 
GBP 600,000. B may rely on that decision to benefit from the same 
reduction of its obligations towards the auction house.  
5.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 4, except that A’s 
refusal to pay the auction house is grounded on a claim that the 
painting is a fake. This is confirmed by an expert opinion ordered 
Art. 11.1.9 
UNIDROIT Principles 
386 
by the court. Accordingly, the contract is avoided. B may also rely 
on that decision to be discharged of its obligations towards the 
auction house. 
6.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 4, except that A had 
separately obtained from the auction house a certificate stating that 
the painting had been shown at some major exhibitions. This turns 
out to be untrue, and a court orders the auction house to pay damages 
to A. B may not rely on that decision, since it is based on grounds 
personal to A. 
4.  Rights of recourse affected accordingly 
If a joint and several obligor avails itself of a court decision rendered 
against its co-obligor, the right of recourse of the co-obligor will be 
affected accordingly. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
7.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 4. A’s obligation 
towards the auction house has been reduced to GBP 600,000. If A, 
after having paid this amount to the auction house, initiates a 
contributory recourse against B, the latter may avail itself of the 
court decision to have its contributory share reduced accordingly. 
ARTICLE  11.1.9  
(Apportionment among joint and several obligors) 
As among themselves, joint and several 
obligors are bound in equal shares, unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise. 
COMMENT 
Articles 11.1.9 to 11.1.13 of this Section deal with contributory 
claims. An obligor who has performed the obligation in favour of the 
obligee has a claim against the other joint and several obligors to 
recuperate their respective shares. 
The first issue is to determine these respective shares. As a default 
rule, Article 11.1.9 states that these shares are equal.

1.  
Companies A and B have borrowed EUR 10,000,000 from 
Bank X to finance the acquisition of stock in another company. In 
principle, A’s and B’s shares in the final allocation will be EUR 
5,000,000 each. 
However, circumstances can indicate otherwise, i.e. that the shares 
are unequal. This will often result from the contractual arrangements 
between the co-obligors. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that A and B 
have agreed that their respective participations in the acquisition 
would be 75% and 25%. There is a presumption that these 
percentages will also govern the final allocation. 
The circumstances may indicate that some obligors are ultimately to 
bear the whole amount of the obligation. This is the case when a party 
agrees to be bound as joint and several obligor not because of its own 
interest in the operation, but to serve as guarantor for the other (“main”) 
obligor (see Comment 3 on Article 11.1.2). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
Company A applies for a loan of EUR 10,000,000 from bank 
X. The loan is granted on the condition that company B intervene as 
joint and several obligor. As between the two companies, it is 
understood that B only serves as a guarantor. The circumstances 
indicate that the shares in the final allocation should be 100% for A 
and 0% for B.  
ARTICLE  11.1.10  
(Extent of contributory claim) 
A joint and several obligor who has 
performed more than its share may claim the 
excess from any of the other obligors to the extent 
of each obligor's unperformed share.  
Art. 11.1.10 
UNIDROIT Principles 
388 
COMMENT 
After a joint and several obligor has paid more than its share to the 
obligee, it has contributory claims against the other obligors to recover 
the excess, on the basis of the respective shares. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
1.  
Companies A and B have borrowed EUR 10,000,000 from 
bank X to finance the acquisition of stock in another company. A’s 
and B’s shares are in principle equal. If A has reimbursed the full 
amount to X, it can claim contribution from B for the amount in 
excess of A’s own share of 50%, i.e. EUR 5,000,000.  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that A and B 
have agreed that their respective participations in the acquisition 
would be 75% and 25%. If A has ultimately to bear 75% of the 
reimbursement, A can only recuperate the excess, i.e. B’s share of 
EUR 2,500,000. 
3.  
Company A applies for a loan of EUR 10,000,000 from bank 
X. The loan is granted on the condition that company B intervene as 
a joint and several obligor. As between the two companies, it is 
understood that B only serves as a guarantor. A’s share is 100%. If B 
has repaid the loan to X, B can claim full reimbursement from A. 
The rule in Article 11.1.10 can also apply in more complex 
circumstances. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4.  
Investors A, B and C have joined efforts to buy an office 
building. The total price amounts to USD 1,000,000 but the 
respective agreed shares are 50%, 30% and 20%. The seller is 
entitled to request payment of USD 1,000,000 from any of the 
obligors but it can only recover USD 650,000 from A; the seller then 
recovers the remaining USD 350,000 from B. A has paid USD 
150,000 in excess of its share of USD 500,000; B has paid USD 
50,000 in excess of its share of USD 300,000. C’s share, on the other 
hand, is totally unpaid. A and B will respectively have contributory 
claims of USD 150,000 and USD 50,000 against C. 
Articles 11.1.6(2), 11.1.7(1)(b) and 11.1.8(b) provide for particular 
rules on the availability of contributory claims under the circumstances 
respectively governed by these provisions.

ARTICLE  11.1.11  
(Rights of the obligee) 
(1)  A joint and several obligor to whom 
Article 11.1.10 applies may also exercise the 
rights of the obligee, including all rights securing 
their performance, to recover the excess from all 
or any of the other obligors to the extent of each 
obligor’s unperformed share. 
(2)  An obligee who has not received full 
performance retains its rights against the co-
obligors to the extent of the unperformed part, 
with precedence over co-obligors exercising 
contributory claims. 
COMMENT 
1.  Subrogation in the obligee’s rights 
A joint and several obligor who has paid more than its share to the 
obligee has a contributory claim against the other obligors under Article 
11.1.10. Article 11.1.11(1) gives the co-obligor who has such a 
contributory claim the possibility of benefiting from the rights of the 
obligee, including all rights securing their performance. This possibility 
is of particular value to the joint and several obligor when the rights of 
the obligee are secured, because the contributory right under Article 
11.1.10 is not secured. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Bank X has lent EUR 500,000 to companies A and B as joint 
and several obligors, secured by a mortgage on A’s premises. B 
reimburses the full amount of the loan. Under Article 11.1.10, B has 
an unsecured claim against A for contribution in the amount of EUR 
250,000. B may also exercise X’s rights against A up to the amount 
of EUR 250,000, including enforcement of the mortgage on A’s 
premises. 
2.  Obligee’s rights reserved and preferred 
By providing that an obligee who has not received full performance 
retains its rights against the joint and several obligors, and by giving 
those retained rights of the obligee precedence over the rights of the 
performing obligor, the rule in Article 11.1.11(2) assures that the 
Art. 11.1.12 
UNIDROIT Principles 
390 
benefit given to the joint and several obligor in Article 11.1.11(1) does 
not detrimentally affect the remaining rights of the obligee. This 
precedence may be effectuated by deferring enforcement of the claim of 
the performing joint and several obligor under Article 11.1.11(1) until 
full performance is received by the obligee. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that B has 
reimbursed only EUR 400,000 of the loan, and the remaining EUR 
100,000 remain unpaid. B has a contributory claim against A for the 
amount in excess of its own share, i.e. EUR 150,000 (EUR 400,000 - 
EUR 250,000). B also has the right to exercise X's rights against A 
up to that amount, including enforcement of the mortgage on A's 
premises. However, as X's rights with respect to the remaining EUR 
100,000 have precedence over the rights of B, enforcement of B's 
rights against A may not occur until after X has received repayment 
of the remaining EUR 100,000. 
The rule on precedence is subject to the possible application of 
mandatory rules providing otherwise in insolvency proceedings. 
ARTICLE  11.1.12  
(Defences in contributory claims) 
A joint and several obligor against whom a 
claim is made by the co-obligor who has 
performed the obligation: 
(a) may raise any common defences and 
rights of set-off that were available to be asserted 
by the co-obligor against the obligee; 
(b) may assert defences which are personal 
to itself ; 
(c) may not assert defences and rights of 
set-off which are personal to one or several of the 
other co-obligors. 
COMMENT 
This provision deals with the defences and rights of set-off that may 
be asserted between co-obligors when contributory claims are exercised.  
 
Plurality of Obligors 
Art. 11.1.12 
 
391 
1.  Common defences and rights of set-off 
Pursuant to Article 11.1.4, the co-obligor that is asked to perform by 
the obligee may assert all defences and rights of set-off common to all 
the co-obligors. If that co-obligor has failed to raise such a defence or 
right of set-off which would have extinguished or reduced the 
obligation, any other joint and several obligor against which the former 
obligor exercises a contributory claim may assert that defence or right of 
set-off. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
1.  
Joint and several obligors A and B have purchased a know-how 
licence together. Licensor X has undertaken that the technology was 
fit for both licencees. If this appeared not to be the case, each obligor 
could invoke this common defence against X. If A fails to do so 
when required to pay the fees by X, B may refuse to pay its 
contributory share to A. 
2.  Personal defences  
A co-obligor may also assert a defence personal to itself against a 
contributory claim. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
Companies A, B and C are jointly and severally bound to pay 
the price of products to be purchased from seller X. A, however, was 
induced to enter the contract by fraud within the meaning of Article 
3.8. B pays the full price to X. A may assert the fraud it had been 
subjected to as a personal defence against B’s contributory claim. 
Under Article 11.1.12, rights of set-off are not subject to the same 
rule as defences, as they usually are in the Principles. The reason for this 
is that the rights of set-off cannot be treated in the same manner as 
defences when it comes to the asserting of a personal right of set-off 
against the obligee to counter a contributory claim. In actual fact, under 
Article 11.1.5, performance by the other co-obligor has discharged the 
first obligor from its obligations towards the obligee, with the 
consequence that the right of set-off does not exist any more. The first 
obligor will have to pay its contributory share to the other obligor, while 
remaining in a position to exercise its distinct claim against the obligee.  
Art. 11.1.13 
UNIDROIT Principles 
392 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
Bank X has lent EUR 3,000,000 to joint and several obligors A 
and B. As a result of the selling of shares belonging to A on the stock 
market, X then becomes A’s obligor for an amount of EUR 500,000, 
thus giving A a right of set-off for that amount. X claims 
reimbursement of EUR 3,000,000 from B, which pays the full 
amount. If B then claims contribution from A, the latter may not 
assert its own right of set-off against B. Such a right does not exist 
any more since payment to X by B has also discharged A towards X. 
A will have to pay its contributory share to B and will be able to 
exercise its own claim of EUR 500,000 against X. 
3.  Defences and rights of set-off personal to other co-obligors 
A co-obligor may not assert a defence or right of set-off which is 
personal to one or several of the other co-obligors. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s   
4.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 2. If B claims 
contribution against C, the latter may not invoke the fraud to which 
A was subject, since this defence is personal to A. 
5.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3. If B claims 
contribution from C, the latter may not assert A’s right of set-off, 
since this right is personal to another obligor. 
ARTICLE  11.1.13  
(Inability to recover) 
If a joint and several obligor who has 
performed more than that obligor’s share is 
unable, despite all reasonable efforts, to recover 
contribution from another joint and several 
obligor, the share of the others, including the one 
who has performed, is increased proportionally.  
COMMENT 
1.  Proportional sharing of the loss

obligor may be unable to recover because the latter is insolvent or has

their contributory shares being equal. After reimbursing the loan, A 
claims EUR 2,000,000 from B and EUR 2,000,000 from C. B turns 
out to be insolvent. The loss of EUR 2,000,000 has to be borne 
proportionally by the other co-obligors, including the one who has 
performed. Since their shares are identical, both A and C will bear an 
equal part of the loss, i.e. EUR 1,000,000 each. Consequently, A can 
recover EUR 3,000,000 from C. 
2.  All reasonable efforts 
Before invoking this Article in order to claim increased contributions 
from the other co-obligors, the obligor who has performed must exert all 
reasonable efforts to recover from the defaulting co-obligor in the light 
of Article 5.1.4(2). 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. A does not question 
B’s assertion that it is unable to pay because of financial difficulties 
and immediately asks for an increased contribution from C. 
However, in order to avail itself of Article 11.1.13, A must 
demonstrate that it has exerted all reasonable efforts to recover from 
B, such as reminders, injunctions, attachments or legal proceedings, 
as may be appropriate.

SECTION  2: PLURALITY OF OBLIGEES 
 
 
 
ARTICLE  11.2.1 
(Definitions) 
When several obligees can claim perform-
ance of the same obligation from an obligor: 
(a)  the claims are separate when each 
obligee can only claim its share; 
(b)  the claims are joint and several when 
each obligee can claim the whole performance; 
(c)  the claims are joint when all obligees 
have to claim performance together. 
COMMENT 
1.  Several obligees 
Plurality of obligees occurs in different situations.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Banks A, B and C join in a syndicated loan agreement to lend 
company X USD 12,000,000. The three banks are plural obligees 
with regard to claiming reimbursement from X. 
Other instances of plurality of obligees occur, among others, with co-
insurers, multiple buyers and/or sellers in share acquisition agreements 
and partners in consortium agreements in various sectors, such as the 
construction sector or the petroleum industry. 
2.  The same obligation 
This Section applies when the different obligees can claim 
performance of the same obligation from the obligor. This is the case in 
Illustration 1 (reimbursement of the syndicated loan). Situations where 
different obligees of the same obligor have rights deriving from 
different obligations do not fall under the scope of this Section. 
 
Plurality of Obligees 
Art. 11.2.1 
 
395 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
Architect A and contractor B are both involved in the 
construction of a new industrial plant. Their respective claims 
against the client concern different obligations (payment of their 
respective types of services). The claims are not subject to the 
Articles in this Section, but to the respectively applicable law. 
On the other hand, when different actors in a construction project 
join in a consortium and claim one payment for all their services, they 
are to be considered as plural obligees for that payment.  
The “same obligation” usually derives from a single contract. In 
Illustration 1, the syndicated loan agreement is a single contract. It could 
however also happen, in the same situation, that each lender would 
choose to have its own contract with the borrower. Co-insurers joining 
to cover the same risk usually have distinct contractual relationships 
with the insured. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
Eight insurance companies agree to co-insure the liability risks 
of a pharmaceutical group. The co-insurance agreement provides that 
each co-insurer has a distinct contractual relationship with the 
insured, but the insured’s obligations towards the co-insurers are the 
same (payment of the agreed premium, required prevention 
measures, loss notification, etc.). These co-insurers are plural 
obligees, subject as such to the Articles in this Section. 
3.  Three main types 
Article 11.2.1 defines three main types of claims available in practice 
when several obligees can claim performance of the same obligation 
from an obligor. 
The claims can be separate. Each obligee can then claim only its 
share.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
4.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. If the claims of banks 
A, B and C against X totalling USD 12,000,000 are separate and if 
their shares are equal, each bank may only claim reimbursement of 
USD 4,000,000 from X. 
The claims can be joint and several, which means that each obligee 
can claim full performance (see Article 11.2.2), subject to subsequent 
allocation between the different obligees (see Article 11.2.4). 
Art. 11.2.1 
UNIDROIT Principles 
396 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
5.  
Companies A and B are co-owners of a storage house, which 
they rent to transport company X. The contract provides that the co-
owners’ claims for the rent are joint and several. A and B may each 
claim payment of the full amount of the rent from X.  
The claims are “joint” when all obligees have to claim together; 
consequently, the obligor may only perform in favour of all of them 
together. This situation is sometimes also referred to as “communal 
claims”. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
6.  
Companies A and B rent an office together, to share in a 
foreign capital. Due to the nature of their claim on occupation of the 
office, A and B are joint obligees. This would not prevent them from 
designating one of them as agent for dealings with the owner of the 
premises. 
4.  No presumption provided 
In the case of plurality of obligors, Article 11.1.2 sets a presumption 
of joint and several obligations, because this corresponds to the most 
frequent commercial practice. 
On the contrary, when it comes to determining to which of the three 
types defined in this Article claims by plural obligees belong, the 
Principles do not provide any presumption. The reason is that none of 
these types seems to be dominant in practice; choices vary considerably, 
mainly depending on the operation concerned. 
Consequently, in situations where plural obligees are involved, 
parties are encouraged to choose the relevant type by an express 
stipulation.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
7.  
Banks A, B and C join in a syndicated loan agreement to offer 
financing to company X. The agreement provides that “All amounts 
due, and obligations owed, to each Bank are separate and 
independent obligations. Each Bank may separately enforce its rights 
under this agreement”. This express provision makes the banks’ 
claims separate. 
8.  
Art collectors A and B, co-owners of a painting by Rothko, sell 
it to a Museum for the price of USD 20,000,000. The contract 
stipulates that each seller can claim payment of the whole price. The 
claims are joint and several. 
 
Plurality of Obligees 
Art. 11.2.1 
 
397 
9.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 8, except that the sales 
contract with the Museum provides that A and B’s claims are 
separate. This means that each of them can only claim payment of 
the price for its own share of the claim, normally corresponding to its 
previous share of ownership. 
Before making such a contractual choice, parties should pay attention 
to the advantages and disadvantages of each of the different types of 
plural claim. 
In particular, joint and several claims have the advantage of avoiding 
the multiplication of law suits. This is an especially important concern 
in international trade. Any of the obligees may claim the whole 
performance. Joint and several claims also simplify the situation of the 
obligor, who will not have to divide performance between its different 
obligees. From the point of view of the plural obligees themselves, 
claims are normally easier if they are joint and several.  
On the other hand, plural obligees have to be aware that if their 
claims are joint and several they lose exclusive control of their 
respective shares. Any other joint and several obligee may claim and 
collect the whole performance, with the risk that later allocation under 
Article 11.2.5 could create difficulties. This explains why separate 
claims seem to be more prevalent in certain sectors (see for instance 
Illustration 1). 
If the parties have failed to make an explicit contractual choice, the 
type to which a plural claim should be assigned will be determined by 
interpretation of the contract in accordance with the provisions in 
Chapter 4. In many instances circumstances such as the nature or the 
purpose of the contract will be especially relevant (see Article 4.3(d)).  
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
10.  Company A, located in country X, and company B, located in 
country Y, join in ordering a large quantity of cars from a 
manufacturer. The cars for country X are right-hand drive, those for 
country Y left-hand drive. When delivery is to be claimed, these 
circumstances indicate that A and B are separate obligees, each one 
being entitled to claim its type of car. 
11.  Tax consultant X has undertaken to give tax advice to 
companies A and B concerning the operations of a joint venture in 
which the latter are involved. Since the tax advice concerns the 
common venture of A and B and this advice is hardly divisible, A 
and B are to be considered as joint and several obligees when 
claiming performance from X. 
Art. 11.2.2 
UNIDROIT Principles 
398 
5.  Possible designation of an agent 
In practice, plural obligees often designate an agent with the 
authority to deal with the obligor on behalf of all of them, within agreed 
limits. This seems to be especially frequent, for practical reasons, when 
the claims are separate. However, in that case, each obligee intends to 
keep full control of its own rights, often reserving the possibility to 
revoke the agent’s authority at any time. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
12.  Banks A, B and C have joined in a syndicated loan agreement 
to lend USD 12,000,000 to company X. The claims are separate, 
USD 4,000,000 for each bank. However, A has been designated as 
agent of the consortium with authority to collect reimbursement of 
the full amount.  
The initiative of designating an intermediary may come from an 
obligor who wants to exert some control over claims which could be 
separately brought by its numerous obligees.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
13.  Under the terms of issue of a bearer bond trustees are appointed 
to represent the interests of bondholders. The issuer covenants to 
make payments to each bondholder in accordance with the terms of 
issue and gives the trustee a parallel payment covenant. Upon the 
issuer’s default the trustee may at its discretion enforce payment and 
must do so if so required by a given percentage in value of 
bondholders. Individual bondholders are precluded from taking 
action on default by the issuer, unless the trustee for the bondholders 
has failed to fulfil its obligation under the trust deed to take 
enforcement action. Each bondholder is a separate obligee. The 
purpose of the trust is simply to monitor performance by the issuer 
and co-ordinate enforcement in order to avoid precipitate action by 
an individual bondholder. 
ARTICLE  11.2.2  
(Effects of joint and several claims) 
Full performance of an obligation in favour 
of one of the joint and several obligees discharges 
the obligor towards the other obligees. 
 
Plurality of Obligees 
Art. 11.2.2 
 
399 
COMMENT 
1.  Each obligee can claim full performance 
The main effect of joint and several claims has already been stated in 
the definition of Article 11.2.1(2). When claims are joint and several 
each obligee is entitled to claim full performance from the obligor. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Co-owners A and B sell their hotel to buyer X for a price of 
EUR 5,000,000. Their shares of co-ownership are equal. The sales 
contract provides that the sellers’ claims concerning payment of the 
price are joint and several. A may claim EUR 5,000,000 from X, 
subject to further allocation under Article 11.2.4. 
2.  Obligor’s choice 
This Article states two other major effects of joint and several 
claims. 
First, if the obligor takes the initiative to spontaneously perform its 
obligation, it is entitled to render performance in favour of any of its 
obligees. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. X takes the initiative 
of paying the price before being invited to do so by either of its 
obligees. X may validly pay to A or to B. 
3.  Obligor’s discharge 
Another main effect of joint and several claims is that the obligor 
who has rendered full performance in favour of one of the obligees is 
discharged towards the other obligees. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. X has paid the whole 
price of EUR 5,000,000 to A. B, having difficulties to recover its 
share from A, requests payment of EUR 2,500,000 from X. Under 
Article 11.2.2(2), the claim will be rejected since full payment to A 
has discharged X towards the other obligee. 
Art. 11.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
400 
4.  Practical aspects 
The right given to each of the joint or several obligees to claim full 
performance may call for some coordination to avoid duplication of 
initiatives and unnecessary costs. Either the obligees have agreed in 
advance on which of them will claim performance, or at least the 
obligee envisaging to take the initiative should consult with its co-
obligees. 
On the other hand, when the obligor takes the initiative its choice of 
obligee to which it will perform may be affected by the fact that another 
obligee is already requesting performance. Some prior consulting may 
then be appropriate. Furthermore, an obligee who has received payment 
should immediately inform the others that performance has been 
rendered.  
These solutions could usefully be agreed in advance by all parties 
involved. Otherwise the requirements of good faith and fair dealing are 
always applicable (Article 1.7). 
ARTICLE  11.2.3  
(Availability of defences against  
joint and several obligees) 
(1)  The obligor may assert against any of 
the joint and several obligees all the defences and 
rights of set-off that are personal to its 
relationship to that obligee or that it can assert 
against all the co-obligees, but may not assert 
defences and rights of set-off that are personal to 
its relationship to one or several of the other co-
obligees. 
(2)  The provisions of Articles 11.1.5, 
11.1.6, 11.1.7 and 11.1.8 apply, with appropriate 
adaptations, to joint and several claims. 
COMMENT 
1.  Availability of defences 
The defences which may entitle the obligor to refuse to perform do 
not necessarily exist against all obligees. Some of the defences may be 
personal to the obligor’s relationship with one obligee only. These 
defences can be asserted only against the obligee concerned.

I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Grain producer X has agreed to supply a certain quantity of 
wheat seeds to companies A, B and C which are engaged in a 
common agricultural project in a developing country. The contract 
provides that A, B and C are joint and several obligees as concerns 
the deliveries. X discovers that the premises where it has to deliver 
the seeds are not equipped with appropriate facilities for convenient 
unloading, the availability of which only A has guaranteed. X may 
invoke this as a defence against A requiring delivery, but not against 
B and C which had not guaranteed that the premises for the delivery 
would be equipped with appropriate facilities.  
The obligor may also assert defences that it has in common against 
all obligees. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. X finds out that the 
agricultural project involves child labour by A, B and C in violation 
of applicable mandatory rules. This is a common defence that X may 
assert against any one of the obligees claiming delivery of the wheat 
seeds. 
2.  Effects of certain defences 
Section 1 of this Chapter contains particular rules about the effects of 
certain types of defence (see Articles 11.1.5, 11.1.6, 11.1.7 and 11.1.8) 
available to joint and several obligors. Paragraph (3) of this Article 
provides that these rules apply, with appropriate adaptations, to joint and 
several claims.  
a.  Performance and set-off (reference to Article 11.1.5) 
Article 11.1.5 provides that “[p]erformance or set-off by a joint and 
several obligor or set-off by the obligee against one joint and several 
obligor discharges the other obligors in relation to the obligee to the 
extent of the performance or set-off”. Similarly, performance received 
by (or set-off exercised by) one of the joint and several obligees 
discharges the obligor towards the other obligees to the extent of the 
performance or set-off. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
3.  
Companies A, B and C have jointly and severally loaned EUR 
300,000 to X. A receives full payment. If B or C still claims 
reimbursement, X may assert that it has fully performed to A. 
Art. 11.2.3 
UNIDROIT Principles 
402 
4.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, except that X can 
claim EUR 300,000 from A for the sale of office equipment. X 
exercises the right of set-off under Article 8.3. Its obligation under 
the loan agreement is extinguished not only vis-à-vis A but also vis-
à-vis B and C. 
b. Release and settlement (reference to Article 11.1.6) 
Article 11.1.6 provides that “[r]elease of one joint and several 
obligor, or settlement with one joint and several obligor, discharges all 
the other obligors for the share of the released or settling obligor, unless 
the circumstances indicate otherwise”. Similarly, release granted to the 
obligor by one of the obligees (or settlement with the obligor by one of 
the obligees) discharges the obligor towards the other obligees to the 
extent of the release or settlement. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  
5.  
Pamela, a famous race horse, has been sold by its co-owners A 
and B to buyer X. Concerning payment of the price, the contract 
provides that A and B are joint and several obligees. If A releases X 
from A’s share of X’s obligation, B’s claim against X is reduced by 
the amount of A’s share. A has no contributory recourse against B 
under Article 11.2.4 (see Article 11.1.6(2)). 
6.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 3, but A, whose share in 
the loan is EUR 100,000, settles with X, accepting a payment of 
EUR 60,000, i.e. an amount below its share. The joint and several 
claims of B and C against X are reduced by the full amount of A’s 
share, i.e. by EUR 100,000, and both remain X’s joint and several 
obligees for EUR 200,000. Settling obligee A has no recourse under 
Article 11.2.4 against B or C (see Article 11.1.6(2)). 
As in Article 11.1.6, with appropriate adaptations, the reference to 
settlement concerns the special case where a separate settlement 
intervenes between the obligor and one of the joint and several obligees 
for the latter’s share. In this case the issue to be solved is that of the 
consequences of such a settlement for the other obligees’ claims.  
In the more frequent situation where the settlement concerns all the 
joint and several claims, the consequences for the different obligees’ 
claims are determined by the terms of the settlement agreed by all 
parties and the contributory claims are adjusted accordingly. 
 
Plurality of Obligees 
Art. 11.2.3 
 
403 
c. Expiration of limitation periods (reference to Article 11.1.7) 
Article 11.1.7 provides that the expiration of the limitation period of 
the obligee’s rights against one joint and several obligor affects neither 
(a) the obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors, 
nor (b) the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors 
under Article 11.1.10. Similarly, the expiration of the limitation period 
of one of the obligees’ rights against the obligor affects neither (a) the 
obligor’s obligations towards the other joint and several obligees, nor 
(b) the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligees under 
Article 11.2.4. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n   
7.  
Obligor X has three joint and several obligees, A, B and C. A’s 
claim against X is time-barred. This does not affect B and C’s claims 
against X. If B or C receives performance from X, A can claim its 
share from the co-obligee having received payment.  
Article 11.1.7 also provides that if the obligee initiates proceedings 
under Articles 10.5, 10.6 or 10.7 against one joint and several obligor, 
the running of the limitation period is suspended also against the other 
joint and several obligors. Similarly, if one of the obligees initiates 
proceedings against the obligor, the running of the limitation period is 
also suspended in favour of the other joint and several obligees. 
d. Effect of judgment (reference to Article 11.1.8) 
Article 11.1.8 provides that a decision by a court as to the liability to 
the obligee of one joint and several obligor affect neither (a) the 
obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors, nor (b) 
the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under 
Article 11.1.10. Similarly, a decision by a court as to the obligor’s 
liability towards one of the joint and several obligees affects neither (a) 
the obligor’s obligations towards the other joint and several obligees, 
nor (b) the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligees 
under Article 11.2.4.  
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
8.  
Obligor X has three joint and several obligees, A, B and C. A, 
acting alone, sues X for performance. The judgement grants A only 
part of its claim. Such judgment does not affect the obligations of X 
towards B or C, nor the recourses between the co-obligees under 
Article 11.2.4.  
Art. 11.2.4 
UNIDROIT Principles 
404 
However, Article 11.1.8(2) also provides that the other joint and 
several obligors may rely on such a decision, except if it were based on 
grounds personal to the obligor concerned. In this case, the rights of 
recourse between the joint and several obligors under Article 11.1.10 are 
affected accordingly. Similarly, the other joint and several obligees may 
rely on the decision if they find it in their interest, except if it was based 
on grounds personal to the obligee concerned. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
9.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 8. This time, however, 
the judgment gives full satisfaction to A, including the awarding of 
additional damages. The other obligees may avail themselves of this 
favourable decision. 
ARTICLE  11.2.4  
(Allocation between joint and several obligees) 
(1)  As among themselves, joint and several 
obligees are entitled to equal shares, unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise. 
(2)  An obligee who has received more than 
its share must transfer the excess to the other 
obligees to the extent of their respective shares. 
COMMENT 
1.  Presumption of equal shares 
Joint and several obligees may each claim full performance of the 
whole obligation under Article 11.2.2. However, as among themselves, 
they are only entitled to their respective shares. These shares are 
presumed to be equal. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
1.  
Co-owners A and B have sold their factory for SFR 10,000,000, 
and they are joint and several obligees for the payment of the price. 
However, once the buyer has paid SFR 10,000,000, each co-owner 
will be entitled to receive its share in the final allocation. In 
principle, the shares are considered to be equal. Each co-owner 
should receive SFR 5,000,000. 
 
Plurality of Obligees 
Art. 11.2.4 
 
405 
However, the circumstances may indicate otherwise. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
2.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1, except that the shares 
of co-ownership of the factory were not equal, but 75% for A and 
25% for B. This will indicate that A should receive SFR 7,500,000 
and B SFR 2,500,000. 
2.  Transfer of excess received 
It will usually happen that the co-obligee claiming payment receives 
more than its share, as it is entitled to claim full performance under 
Article 11.2.2. When an obligee has received more than its share, it must 
transfer the excess to the other obligees to the extent of their respective 
shares. 
I l l u s t r a t i o n  
3.  
The facts are the same as in Illustration 1. A has been paid the 
full price of the factory, i.e. SFR 10,000,000, and its share of co-
ownership was 50%. A must transfer SFR 5,000,000 to B. 
Whether the claim of the other obligees to the sums in excess is a 
property right or merely a personal claim against the obligee who 
received more than its share is outside the scope of the Principles.

their application. 
(2) 
Issues within the scope of these Principles but not expressly settled by them 
are as far as possible to be settled in accordance with their underlying general principles. 
ARTICLE  1.7 
(Good faith and fair dealing) 
(1) 
Each party must act in accordance with good faith and fair dealing in 
international trade. 
(2) 
The parties may not exclude or limit this duty. 
ARTICLE  1.8 
(Inconsistent behaviour) 
A party cannot act inconsistently with an understanding it has caused the other party 
to have and upon which that other party reasonably has acted in reliance to its detriment. 
ARTICLE  1.9 
(Usages and practices) 
(1) 
The parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any 
practices which they have established between themselves. 
(2) 
The parties are bound by a usage that is widely known to and regularly 
observed in international trade by parties in the particular trade concerned except where 
the application of such a usage would be unreasonable. 
ARTICLE  1.10 
(Notice) 
(1) 
Where notice is required it may be given by any means appropriate to the 
circumstances. 
(2) 
A notice is effective when it reaches the person to whom it is given.

that person orally or delivered at that person’s place of business or mailing address. 
(4)

request or any other communication of intention. 
ARTICLE  1.11 
(Definitions) 
In these Principles 
–  
“court” includes an arbitral tribunal; 
– 
where a party has more than one place of business the relevant “place of 
business” is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance, 
having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time 
before or at the conclusion of the contract; 
–  
“long-term contract” refers to a contract which is to be performed over a 
period of time and which normally involves, to a varying degree, complexity of the 
transaction and an ongoing relationship between the parties; 
– 
“obligor” refers to the party who is to perform an obligation and “obligee” 
refers to the party who is entitled to performance of that obligation;

Annex 
 
411 
ARTICLE  1.12 
(Computation of time set by parties) 
(1) 
Official holidays or non-business days occurring during a period set by parties 
for an act to be performed are included in calculating the period. 
(2) 
However, if the last day of the period is an official holiday or a non-business 
day at the place of business of the party to perform the act, the period is extended until 
the first business day which follows, unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
(3) 
The relevant time zone is that of the place of business of the party setting the 
time, unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
CHAPTER  2 — FORMATION AND AUTHORITY OF AGENTS 
SECTION  1:  FORMATION 
ARTICLE  2.1.1 
(Manner of formation) 
A contract may be concluded either by the acceptance of an offer or by conduct of 
the parties that is sufficient to show agreement. 
ARTICLE  2.1.2 
(Definition of offer) 
A proposal for concluding a contract constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite 
and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. 
ARTICLE  2.1.3 
(Withdrawal of offer) 
(1) 
An offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree. 
(2) 
An offer, even if it is irrevocable, may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches 
the offeree before or at the same time as the offer. 
ARTICLE  2.1.4 
(Revocation of offer) 
(1) 
Until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revocation reaches 
the offeree before it has dispatched an acceptance. 
(2) 
However, an offer cannot be revoked 
(a) 
if it indicates, whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise, that 
it is irrevocable; or 
(b) 
if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and 
the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer. 
ARTICLE  2.1.5 
(Rejection of offer) 
An offer is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror. 
ARTICLE  2.1.6 
(Mode of acceptance) 
(1) 
A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an 
offer is an acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance. 
(2) 
An acceptance of an offer becomes effective when the indication of assent 
reaches the offeror. 
(3) 
However, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties 
have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by 
UNIDROIT Principles 
412 
performing an act without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective when the act 
is performed. 
ARTICLE  2.1.7 
(Time of acceptance) 
An offer must be accepted within the time the offeror has fixed or, if no time is 
fixed, within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances, including the 
rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. An oral offer must be 
accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
ARTICLE  2.1.8 
(Acceptance within a fixed period of time) 
A period of acceptance fixed by the offeror begins to run from the time that the offer 
is dispatched. A time indicated in the offer is deemed to be the time of dispatch unless 
the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
ARTICLE  2.1.9 
(Late acceptance. Delay in transmission) 
(1) 
A late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without undue 
delay the offeror so informs the offeree or gives notice to that effect. 
(2) 
If a communication containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in 
such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the 
offeror in due time, the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless, without 
undue delay, the offeror informs the offeree that it considers the offer as having lapsed. 
ARTICLE  2.1.10 
(Withdrawal of acceptance) 
An acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at 
the same time as the acceptance would have become effective. 
ARTICLE  2.1.11 
(Modified acceptance) 
(1) 
A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, 
limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-of-
fer. 
(2) 
However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains 
additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer 
constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects to the 
discrepancy. If the offeror does not object, the terms of the contract are the terms of the 
offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance. 
ARTICLE  2.1.12 
(Writings in confirmation) 
If a writing which is sent within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the 
contract and which purports to be a confirmation of the contract contains additional or 
different terms, such terms become part of the contract, unless they materially alter the 
contract or the recipient, without undue delay, objects to the discrepancy. 
ARTICLE  2.1.13 
(Conclusion of contract dependent on agreement on specific matters  
or in a particular form) 
Where in the course of negotiations one of the parties insists that the contract is not 
concluded until there is agreement on specific matters or in a particular form, no 
contract is concluded before agreement is reached on those matters or in that form. 
 
Annex 
 
413 
ARTICLE  2.1.14 
(Contract with terms deliberately left open) 
(1) 
If the parties intend to conclude a contract, the fact that they intentionally 
leave a term to be agreed upon in further negotiations or to be determined by one of the 
parties or by a third person does not prevent a contract from coming into existence. 
(2) 
The existence of the contract is not affected by the fact that subsequently 
(a) 
the parties reach no agreement on the term; 
(b) 
the party who is to determine the term does not do so; or 
(c) 
the third person does not determine the term, 
provided that there is an alternative means of rendering the term definite that is 
reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the intention of the parties. 
ARTICLE  2.1.15 
(Negotiations in bad faith) 
(1) 
A party is free to negotiate and is not liable for failure to reach an agreement. 
(2) 
However, a party who negotiates or breaks off negotiations in bad faith is 
liable for the losses caused to the other party. 
(3) 
It is bad faith, in particular, for a party to enter into or continue negotiations 
when intending not to reach an agreement with the other party. 
ARTICLE  2.1.16 
(Duty of confidentiality) 
Where information is given as confidential by one party in the course of 
negotiations, the other party is under a duty not to disclose that information or to use it 
improperly for its own purposes, whether or not a contract is subsequently concluded. 
Where appropriate, the remedy for breach of that duty may include compensation based 
on the benefit received by the other party. 
ARTICLE  2.1.17 
(Merger clauses) 
A contract in writing which contains a clause indicating that the writing completely 
embodies the terms on which the parties have agreed cannot be contradicted or 
supplemented by evidence of prior statements or agreements. However, such statements 
or agreements may be used to interpret the writing. 
ARTICLE  2.1.18 
(Modification in a particular form) 
A contract in writing which contains a clause requiring any modification or 
termination by agreement to be in a particular form may not be otherwise modified or 
terminated. However, a party may be precluded by its conduct from asserting such a 
clause to the extent that the other party has reasonably acted in reliance on that conduct. 
ARTICLE  2.1.19 
(Contracting under standard terms) 
(1) 
Where one party or both parties use standard terms in concluding a contract, 
the general rules on formation apply, subject to Articles 2.1.20 - 2.1.22. 
(2) 
Standard terms are provisions which are prepared in advance for general and 
repeated use by one party and which are actually used without negotiation with the other 
party. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
414 
ARTICLE  2.1.20 
(Surprising terms) 
(1) 
No term contained in standard terms which is of such a character that the other 
party could not reasonably have expected it, is effective unless it has been expressly 
accepted by that party. 
(2) 
In determining whether a term is of such a character regard shall be had to its 
content, language and presentation. 
ARTICLE  2.1.21 
(Conflict between standard terms and non-standard terms) 
In case of conflict between a standard term and a term which is not a standard term 
the latter prevails. 
ARTICLE  2.1.22 
(Battle of forms) 
Where both parties use standard terms and reach agreement except on those terms, a 
contract is concluded on the basis of the agreed terms and of any standard terms which 
are common in substance unless one party clearly indicates in advance, or later and 
without undue delay informs the other party, that it does not intend to be bound by such 
a contract. 
SECTION  2: AUTHORITY OF AGENTS 
ARTICLE  2.2.1 
(Scope of the Section) 
(1) 
This Section governs the authority of a person (“the agent”) to affect the legal 
relations of another person (“the principal”) by or with respect to a contract with a third 
party, whether the agent acts in its own name or in that of the principal. 
(2) 
It governs only the relations between the principal or the agent on the one 
hand, and the third party on the other. 
(3) 
It does not govern an agent’s authority conferred by law or the authority of an 
agent appointed by a public or judicial authority. 
ARTICLE  2.2.2 
(Establishment and scope of the authority of the agent) 
(1) 
The principal’s grant of authority to an agent may be express or implied. 
(2) 
The agent has authority to perform all acts necessary in the circumstances to 
achieve the purposes for which the authority was granted. 
ARTICLE  2.2.3 
(Agency disclosed) 
(1) 
Where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party knew 
or ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent, the acts of the agent shall 
directly affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party and no legal 
relation is created between the agent and the third party.  
(2) 
However, the acts of the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent 
and the third party, where the agent with the consent of the principal undertakes to 
become the party to the contract. 
 
Annex 
 
415 
ARTICLE  2.2.4 
(Agency undisclosed) 
(1) 
Where an agent acts within the scope of its authority and the third party 
neither knew nor ought to have known that the agent was acting as an agent, the acts of 
the agent shall affect only the relations between the agent and the third party. 
(2) 
However, where such an agent, when contracting with the third party on 
behalf of a business, represents itself to be the owner of that business, the third party, 
upon discovery of the real owner of the business, may exercise also against the latter the 
rights it has against the agent.  
ARTICLE  2.2.5 
(Agent acting without or exceeding its authority) 
(1) 
Where an agent acts without authority or exceeds its authority, its acts do not 
affect the legal relations between the principal and the third party. 
(2) 
However, where the principal causes the third party reasonably to believe that 
the agent has authority to act on behalf of the principal and that the agent is acting 
within the scope of that authority, the principal may not invoke against the third party 
the lack of authority of the agent. 
ARTICLE  2.2.6 
(Liability of agent acting without or exceeding its authority) 
(1) 
An agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority is, failing 
ratification by the principal, liable for damages that will place the third party in the same 
position as if the agent had acted with authority and not exceeded its authority.  
(2) 
However, the agent is not liable if the third party knew or ought to have 
known that the agent had no authority or was exceeding its authority. 
ARTICLE  2.2.7 
(Conflict of interests) 
(1) 
If a contract concluded by an agent involves the agent in a conflict of interests 
with the principal of which the third party knew or ought to have known, the principal 
may avoid the contract. The right to avoid is subject to Articles 3.2.9 and 3.2.11 to 
3.2.15. 
(2) 
However, the principal may not avoid the contract 
(a) 
if the principal had consented to, or knew or ought to have known of, the 
agent’s involvement in the conflict of interests; or 
(b) 
if the agent had disclosed the conflict of interests to the principal and the latter 
had not objected within a reasonable time. 
 
ARTICLE  2.2.8 
(Sub-agency) 
An agent has implied authority to appoint a sub-agent to perform acts which it is not 
reasonable to expect the agent to perform itself. The rules of this Section apply to the 
sub-agency. 
ARTICLE  2.2.9 
(Ratification) 
(1) 
An act by an agent that acts without authority or exceeds its authority may be 
ratified by the principal. On ratification the act produces the same effects as if it had 
initially been carried out with authority. 
(2) 
The third party may by notice to the principal specify a reasonable period of 
time for ratification. If the principal does not ratify within that period of time it can no 
longer do so. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
416 
(3) 
If, at the time of the agent’s act, the third party neither knew nor ought to have 
known of the lack of authority, it may, at any time before ratification, by notice to the 
principal indicate its refusal to become bound by a ratification.  
ARTICLE  2.2.10 
(Termination of authority) 
(1) 
Termination of authority is not effective in relation to the third party unless the 
third party knew or ought to have known of it. 
(2) 
Notwithstanding the termination of its authority, an agent remains authorised 
to perform the acts that are necessary to prevent harm to the principal’s interests. 
CHAPTER  3 — VALIDITY 
SECTION  1: GENERAL PROVISIONS 
ARTICLE  3.1.1 
(Matters not covered) 
This Chapter does not deal with lack of capacity. 
ARTICLE  3.1.2 
(Validity of mere agreement) 
A contract is concluded, modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the 
parties, without any further requirement. 
ARTICLE  3.1.3 
(Initial impossibility) 
(1) 
The mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract the 
performance of the obligation assumed was impossible does not affect the validity of the 
contract. 
(2) 
The mere fact that at the time of the conclusion of the contract a party was not 
entitled to dispose of the assets to which the contract relates does not affect the validity 
of the contract. 
ARTICLE  3.1.4 
(Mandatory character of the provisions) 
The provisions on fraud, threat, gross disparity and illegality contained in this 
Chapter are mandatory. 
SECTION  2: GROUNDS FOR AVOIDANCE 
ARTICLE  3.2.1 
(Definition of mistake) 
Mistake is an erroneous assumption relating to facts or to law existing when the 
contract was concluded. 
ARTICLE  3.2.2 
(Relevant mistake) 
(1) 
A party may only avoid the contract for mistake if, when the contract was 
concluded, the mistake was of such importance that a reasonable person in the same 
situation as the party in error would only have concluded the contract on materially 
different terms or would not have concluded it at all if the true state of affairs had been 
known, and 
 
Annex 
 
417 
(a) 
the other party made the same mistake, or caused the mistake, or knew or ought to 
have known of the mistake and it was contrary to reasonable commercial standards of 
fair dealing to leave the mistaken party in error; or 
(b) 
the other party had not at the time of avoidance reasonably acted in reliance on 
the contract. 
(2) 
However, a party may not avoid the contract if  
(a) 
it was grossly negligent in committing the mistake; or 
(b) 
the mistake relates to a matter in regard to which the risk of mistake was as-
sumed or, having regard to the circumstances, should be borne by the mistaken party. 
ARTICLE  3.2.3 
(Error in expression or transmission) 
An error occurring in the expression or transmission of a declaration is considered to 
be a mistake of the person from whom the declaration emanated. 
ARTICLE  3.2.4 
(Remedies for non-performance) 
A party is not entitled to avoid the contract on the ground of mistake if the 
circumstances on which that party relies afford, or could have afforded, a remedy for 
non-performance. 
ARTICLE  3.2.5 
(Fraud) 
A party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the 
other party’s fraudulent representation, including language or practices, or fraudulent 
non-disclosure of circumstances which, according to reasonable commercial standards 
of fair dealing, the latter party should have disclosed. 
ARTICLE  3.2.6 
(Threat) 
A party may avoid the contract when it has been led to conclude the contract by the 
other party’s unjustified threat which, having regard to the circumstances, is so 
imminent and serious as to leave the first party no reasonable alternative. In particular, a 
threat is unjustified if the act or omission with which a party has been threatened is 
wrongful in itself, or it is wrongful to use it as a means to obtain the conclusion of the 
contract. 
ARTICLE  3.2.7 
(Gross disparity) 
(1) 
A party may avoid the contract or an individual term of it if, at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract, the contract or term unjustifiably gave the other party an 
excessive advantage. Regard is to be had, among other factors, to 
(a) 
the fact that the other party has taken unfair advantage of the first party’s 
dependence, economic distress or urgent needs, or of its improvidence, ignorance, 
inexperience or lack of bargaining skill, and 
(b) 
the nature and purpose of the contract. 
(2) 
Upon the request of the party entitled to avoidance, a court may adapt the 
contract or term in order to make it accord with reasonable commercial standards of fair 
dealing. 
(3) 
A court may also adapt the contract or term upon the request of the party 
receiving notice of avoidance, provided that that party informs the other party of its 
request promptly after receiving such notice and before the other party has reasonably 
acted in reliance on it. Article 3.2.10(2) applies accordingly. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
418 
ARTICLE  3.2.8 
(Third persons) 
(1) 
Where fraud, threat, gross disparity or a party’s mistake is imputable to, or is 
known or ought to be known by, a third person for whose acts the other party is 
responsible, the contract may be avoided under the same conditions as if the behaviour 
or knowledge had been that of the party itself. 
(2) 
Where fraud, threat or gross disparity is imputable to a third person for whose 
acts the other party is not responsible, the contract may be avoided if that party knew or 
ought to have known of the fraud, threat or disparity, or has not at the time of avoidance 
reasonably acted in reliance on the contract. 
ARTICLE  3.2.9 
(Confirmation) 
If the party entitled to avoid the contract expressly or impliedly confirms the 
contract after the period of time for giving notice of avoidance has begun to run, 
avoidance of the contract is excluded. 
ARTICLE  3.2.10 
(Loss of right to avoid) 
(1) 
If a party is entitled to avoid the contract for mistake but the other party 
declares itself willing to perform or performs the contract as it was understood by the 
party entitled to avoidance, the contract is considered to have been concluded as the 
latter party understood it. The other party must make such a declaration or render such 
performance promptly after having been informed of the manner in which the party 
entitled to avoidance had understood the contract and before that party has reasonably 
acted in reliance on a notice of avoidance. 
(2) 
After such a declaration or performance the right to avoidance is lost and any 
earlier notice of avoidance is ineffective. 
ARTICLE  3.2.11 
(Notice of avoidance) 
The right of a party to avoid the contract is exercised by notice to the other party. 
ARTICLE  3.2.12 
(Time limits) 
(1) 
Notice of avoidance shall be given within a reasonable time, having regard to 
the circumstances, after the avoiding party knew or could not have been unaware of the 
relevant facts or became capable of acting freely. 
(2) 
Where an individual term of the contract may be avoided by a party under 
Article 3.2.7, the period of time for giving notice of avoidance begins to run when that 
term is asserted by the other party. 
ARTICLE  3.2.13 
(Partial avoidance) 
Where a ground of avoidance affects only individual terms of the contract, the effect 
of avoidance is limited to those terms unless, having regard to the circumstances, it is 
unreasonable to uphold the remaining contract. 
ARTICLE  3.2.14 
(Retroactive effect of avoidance) 
Avoidance takes effect retroactively. 
 
Annex 
 
419 
ARTICLE 3.2.15 
(Restitution) 
(1) 
 On avoidance either party may claim restitution of whatever it has supplied 
under the contract, or the part of it avoided, provided that the party concurrently makes 
restitution of whatever it has received under the contract, or the part of it avoided. 
(2) 
 If restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate, an allowance has to be 
made in money whenever reasonable. 
(3) The recipient of the performance does not have to make an allowance in money 
if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attributable to the other party. 
(4) 
Compensation may be claimed for expenses reasonably required to preserve or 
maintain the performance received. 
ARTICLE  3.2.16 
(Damages) 
Irrespective of whether or not the contract has been avoided, the party who knew or 
ought to have known of the ground for avoidance is liable for damages so as to put the 
other party in the same position in which it would have been if it had not concluded the 
contract. 
ARTICLE  3.2.17 
(Unilateral declarations) 
The provisions of this Chapter apply with appropriate adaptations to any commu-
nication of intention addressed by one party to the other. 
SECTION  3: ILLEGALITY 
ARTICLE  3.3.1 
(Contracts infringing mandatory rules) 
(1)  Where a contract infringes a mandatory rule, whether of national, international 
or supranational origin, applicable under Article 1.4 of these Principles, the effects of 
that infringement upon the contract are the effects, if any, expressly prescribed by that 
mandatory rule. 
(2)  Where the mandatory rule does not expressly prescribe the effects of an 
infringement upon a contract, the parties have the right to exercise such remedies under 
the contract as in the circumstances are reasonable.  
(3)  In determining what is reasonable regard is to be had in particular to:  
(a) 
the purpose of the rule which has been infringed;  
(b) 
the category of persons for whose protection the rule exists;  
(c) 
any sanction that may be imposed under the rule infringed;  
(d) 
the seriousness of the infringement;  
(e) 
whether one or both parties knew or ought to have known of the infringement;  
(f) 
whether the performance of the contract necessitates the infringement; and 
(g) 
the parties’ reasonable expectations.  
ARTICLE  3.3.2 
(Restitution) 
(1)  Where there has been performance under a contract infringing a mandatory 
rule under Article 3.3.1, restitution may be granted where this would be reasonable in 
the circumstances.  
(2)  In determining what is reasonable, regard is to be had, with the appropriate 
adaptations, to the criteria referred to in Article 3.3.1(3). 
(3) 
If restitution is granted, the rules set out in Article 3.2.15 apply with 
appropriate adaptations.

give to it in the same circumstances. 
ARTICLE  4.2

shall be interpreted according to the meaning that a reasonable person of the same kind 
as the other party would give to it in the same circumstances.

party is preferred. 
ARTICLE  4.7 
(Linguistic discrepancies)

CHAPTER  5 — CONTENT AND THIRD PARTY RIGHTS

ARTICLE  5.1.1 
(Express and implied obligations) 
The contractual obligations of the parties may be express or implied. 
ARTICLE  5.1.2 
(Implied obligations) 
Implied obligations stem from

Duty of best efforts) 
(1) 
To the extent that an obligation of a party involves a duty to achieve a specific 
result, that party is bound to achieve that result. 
(2)

performance of an activity, that party is bound to make such efforts as would be made 
by a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances. 
ARTICLE  5.1.5 
(Determination of kind of duty involved) 
In determining the extent to which an obligation of a party involves a duty of best 
efforts in the performance of an activity or a duty to achieve a specific result, regard 
shall be had, among other factors, to 
(a) 
the way in which the obligation is expressed in the contract;

less than average in the circumstances. 
ARTICLE  5.1.7 
(Price determination) 
(1) 
Where a contract does not fix or make provision for determining the price, the 
parties are considered, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, to have made 
reference to the price generally charged at the time of the conclusion of the contract for 
such performance in comparable circumstances in the trade concerned or, if no such 
price is available, to a reasonable price. 
(2) 
Where the price is to be determined by one party and that determination is 
manifestly unreasonable, a reasonable price shall be substituted notwithstanding any 
contract term to the contrary. 
(3) 
Where the price is to be fixed by one party or a third person, and that party or 
third person does not do so, the price shall be a reasonable price. 
(4) 
Where the price is to be fixed by reference to factors which do not exist or 
have ceased to exist or to be accessible, the nearest equivalent factor shall be treated as a 
substitute. 
ARTICLE  5.1.8 
(Termination of a contract for an indefinite period) 
A contract for an indefinite period may be terminated by either party by giving 
notice a reasonable time in advance. As to the effects of termination in general, and as to 
restitution, the provisions in Articles 7.3.5 and 7.3.7 apply. 
ARTICLE  5.1.9 
(Release by agreement) 
(1) 
An obligee may release its right by agreement with the obligor. 
(2)

(Renunciation) 
The beneficiary may renounce a right conferred on it. 
SECTION  3: CONDITIONS 
ARTICLE  5.3.1 
(Types of condition)

(resolutive condition).  
ARTICLE  5.3.2 
(Effect of conditions) 
Unless the parties otherwise agree: 
(a)  the relevant contract or contractual obligation takes effect upon fulfilment of a 
suspensive condition;

retroactively, the rules on restitution set out in Article 3.2.15 apply with appropriate 
adaptations.  
CHAPTER  6 — PERFORMANCE 
SECTION  1: PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL 
ARTICLE  6.1.1 
(Time of performance) 
A party must perform its obligations: 
(a) 
if a time is fixed by or determinable from the contract, at that time; 
(b) 
if a period of time is fixed by or determinable from the contract, at any time 
within that period unless circumstances indicate that the other party is to choose a time; 
(c) 
in any other case, within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract. 
ARTICLE  6.1.2 
(Performance at one time or in instalments) 
In cases under Article 6.1.1(b) or (c), a party must perform its obligations at one 
time if that performance can be rendered at one time and the circumstances do not 
indicate otherwise. 
ARTICLE  6.1.3 
(Partial performance) 
(1) 
The obligee may reject an offer to perform in part at the time performance is 
due, whether or not such offer is coupled with an assurance as to the balance of the 
performance, unless the obligee has no legitimate interest in so doing. 
(2) 
Additional expenses caused to the obligee by partial performance are to be 
borne by the obligor without prejudice to any other remedy. 
ARTICLE  6.1.4 
(Order of performance) 
(1) 
To the extent that the performances of the parties can be rendered 
simultaneously, the parties are bound to render them simultaneously unless the 
circumstances indicate otherwise. 
(2) 
To the extent that the performance of only one party requires a period of time, 
that party is bound to render its performance first, unless the circumstances indicate 
otherwise. 
ARTICLE  6.1.5 
(Earlier performance) 
(1) 
The obligee may reject an earlier performance unless it has no legitimate 
interest in so doing. 
(2) 
Acceptance by a party of an earlier performance does not affect the time for 
the performance of its own obligations if that time has been fixed irrespective of the 
performance of the other party’s obligations. 
(3) 
Additional expenses caused to the obligee by earlier performance are to be 
borne by the obligor, without prejudice to any other remedy. 
ARTICLE  6.1.6 
(Place of performance) 
(1) 
If the place of performance is neither fixed by, nor determinable from, the 
contract, a party is to perform: 
 
Annex 
 
425 
(a) 
a monetary obligation, at the obligee’s place of business; 
(b) 
any other obligation, at its own place of business. 
(2) 
A party must bear any increase in the expenses incidental to performance 
which is caused by a change in its place of business subsequent to the conclusion of the 
contract. 
ARTICLE  6.1.7 
(Payment by cheque or other instrument) 
(1) 
Payment may be made in any form used in the ordinary course of business at 
the place for payment. 
(2) 
However, an obligee who accepts, either by virtue of paragraph (1) or 
voluntarily, a cheque, any other order to pay or a promise to pay, is presumed to do so 
only on condition that it will be honoured. 
ARTICLE  6.1.8 
(Payment by funds transfer) 
(1) 
Unless the obligee has indicated a particular account, payment may be made 
by a transfer to any of the financial institutions in which the obligee has made it known 
that it has an account. 
(2) 
In case of payment by a transfer the obligation of the obligor is discharged 
when the transfer to the obligee’s financial institution becomes effective. 
ARTICLE  6.1.9 
(Currency of payment) 
(1) 
If a monetary obligation is expressed in a currency other than that of the place 
for payment, it may be paid by the obligor in the currency of the place for payment 
unless 
(a) 
that currency is not freely convertible; or 
(b) 
the parties have agreed that payment should be made only in the currency in 
which the monetary obligation is expressed. 
(2) 
If it is impossible for the obligor to make payment in the currency in which the 
monetary obligation is expressed, the obligee may require payment in the currency of 
the place for payment, even in the case referred to in paragraph (1)(b). 
(3) 
Payment in the currency of the place for payment is to be made according to 
the applicable rate of exchange prevailing there when payment is due. 
(4) 
However, if the obligor has not paid at the time when payment is due, the 
obligee may require payment according to the applicable rate of exchange prevailing 
either when payment is due or at the time of actual payment. 
ARTICLE  6.1.10 
(Currency not expressed) 
Where a monetary obligation is not expressed in a particular currency, payment must 
be made in the currency of the place where payment is to be made. 
ARTICLE  6.1.11 
(Costs of performance) 
Each party shall bear the costs of performance of its obligations. 
ARTICLE  6.1.12 
(Imputation of payments) 
(1) 
An obligor owing several monetary obligations to the same obligee may 
specify at the time of payment the debt to which it intends the payment to be applied. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
426 
However, the payment discharges first any expenses, then interest due and finally the 
principal. 
(2) 
If the obligor makes no such specification, the obligee may, within a 
reasonable time after payment, declare to the obligor the obligation to which it imputes 
the payment, provided that the obligation is due and undisputed. 
(3) 
In the absence of imputation under paragraphs (1) or (2), payment is imputed 
to that obligation which satisfies one of the following criteria in the order indicated: 
(a) 
an obligation which is due or which is the first to fall due; 
(b) 
the obligation for which the obligee has least security; 
(c) 
the obligation which is the most burdensome for the obligor; 
(d) 
the obligation which has arisen first. 
If none of the preceding criteria applies, payment is imputed to all the obligations 
proportionally. 
ARTICLE  6.1.13 
(Imputation of non-monetary obligations) 
Article 6.1.12 applies with appropriate adaptations to the imputation of performance 
of non-monetary obligations. 
ARTICLE  6.1.14 
(Application for public permission) 
Where the law of a State requires a public permission affecting the validity of the 
contract or its performance and neither that law nor the circumstances indicate otherwise 
(a)  if only one party has its place of business in that State, that party shall take the 
measures necessary to obtain the permission; 
(b)  in any other case the party whose performance requires permission shall take 
the necessary measures. 
ARTICLE  6.1.15 
(Procedure in applying for permission) 
(1) 
The party required to take the measures necessary to obtain the permission 
shall do so without undue delay and shall bear any expenses incurred. 
(2) 
That party shall whenever appropriate give the other party notice of the grant 
or refusal of such permission without undue delay. 
ARTICLE  6.1.16 
(Permission neither granted nor refused) 
(1) 
If, notwithstanding the fact that the party responsible has taken all measures 
required, permission is neither granted nor refused within an agreed period or, where no 
period has been agreed, within a reasonable time from the conclusion of the contract, 
either party is entitled to terminate the contract. 
(2) 
Where the permission affects some terms only, paragraph (1) does not apply 
if, having regard to the circumstances, it is reasonable to uphold the remaining contract 
even if the permission is refused. 
ARTICLE  6.1.17 
(Permission refused) 
(1) 
The refusal of a permission affecting the validity of the contract renders the 
contract void. If the refusal affects the validity of some terms only, only such terms are 
void if, having regard to the circumstances, it is reasonable to uphold the remaining 
contract. 
(2) 
Where the refusal of a permission renders the performance of the contract 
impossible in whole or in part, the rules on non-performance apply. 
 
Annex 
 
427 
SECTION  2: HARDSHIP 
ARTICLE  6.2.1 
(Contract to be observed) 
Where the performance of a contract becomes more onerous for one of the parties, 
that party is nevertheless bound to perform its obligations subject to the following 
provisions on hardship. 
ARTICLE  6.2.2 
(Definition of hardship) 
There is hardship where the occurrence of events fundamentally alters the equilib-
rium of the contract either because the cost of a party’s performance has increased or 
because the value of the performance a party receives has diminished, and 
(a) 
the events occur or become known to the disadvantaged party after the conclu-
sion of the contract; 
(b) 
the events could not reasonably have been taken into account by the disadvan-
taged party at the time of the conclusion of the contract; 
(c) 
the events are beyond the control of the disadvantaged party; and 
(d) 
the risk of the events was not assumed by the disadvantaged party. 
ARTICLE  6.2.3 
(Effects of hardship) 
(1) 
In case of hardship the disadvantaged party is entitled to request renegotia-
tions. The request shall be made without undue delay and shall indicate the grounds on 
which it is based. 
(2) 
The request for renegotiation does not in itself entitle the disadvantaged party 
to withhold performance. 
(3) 
Upon failure to reach agreement within a reasonable time either party may 
resort to the court. 
(4) 
If the court finds hardship it may, if reasonable, 
(a) 
terminate the contract at a date and on terms to be fixed, or 
(b) 
adapt the contract with a view to restoring its equilibrium. 
CHAPTER  7 — NON-PERFORMANCE 
SECTION  1: NON-PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL 
ARTICLE  7.1.1 
(Non-performance defined) 
Non-performance is failure by a party to perform any of its obligations under the 
contract, including defective performance or late performance. 
ARTICLE  7.1.2 
(Interference by the other party) 
A party may not rely on the non-performance of the other party to the extent that 
such non-performance was caused by the first party’s act or omission or by another 
event for which the first party bears the risk. 
ARTICLE  7.1.3 
(Withholding performance) 
(1) 
Where the parties are to perform simultaneously, either party may withhold 
performance until the other party tenders its performance. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
428 
(2) 
Where the parties are to perform consecutively, the party that is to perform 
later may withhold its performance until the first party has performed. 
ARTICLE  7.1.4 
(Cure by non-performing party) 
(1)  The non-performing party may, at its own expense, cure any non-performance, 
provided that  
(a) 
without undue delay, it gives notice indicating the proposed manner and 
timing of the cure; 
(b) 
cure is appropriate in the circumstances; 
(c) 
the aggrieved party has no legitimate interest in refusing cure; and 
(d) 
cure is effected promptly. 
(2) 
The right to cure is not precluded by notice of termination. 
(3) 
Upon effective notice of cure, rights of the aggrieved party that are 
inconsistent with the non-performing party’s performance are suspended until the time 
for cure has expired. 
(4) 
The aggrieved party may withhold performance pending cure. 
(5) 
Notwithstanding cure, the aggrieved party retains the right to claim damages 
for delay as well as for any harm caused or not prevented by the cure. 
ARTICLE  7.1.5 
(Additional period for performance) 
(1) 
In a case of non-performance the aggrieved party may by notice to the other 
party allow an additional period of time for performance. 
(2) 
During the additional period the aggrieved party may withhold performance of 
its own reciprocal obligations and may claim damages but may not resort to any other 
remedy. If it receives notice from the other party that the latter will not perform within 
that period, or if upon expiry of that period due performance has not been made, the ag-
grieved party may resort to any of the remedies that may be available under this 
Chapter. 
(3) 
Where in a case of delay in performance which is not fundamental the 
aggrieved party has given notice allowing an additional period of time of reasonable 
length, it may terminate the contract at the end of that period. If the additional period 
allowed is not of reasonable length it shall be extended to a reasonable length. The 
aggrieved party may in its notice provide that if the other party fails to perform within 
the period allowed by the notice the contract shall automatically terminate. 
(4) 
Paragraph (3) does not apply where the obligation which has not been 
performed is only a minor part of the contractual obligation of the non-performing party. 
ARTICLE  7.1.6 
(Exemption clauses) 
A clause which limits or excludes one party’s liability for non-performance or which 
permits one party to render performance substantially different from what the other 
party reasonably expected may not be invoked if it would be grossly unfair to do so, 
having regard to the purpose of the contract. 
ARTICLE  7.1.7 
(Force majeure) 
(1) 
Non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-
performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not 
reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences. 
 
Annex 
 
429 
(2) 
When the impediment is only temporary, the excuse shall have effect for such 
period as is reasonable having regard to the effect of the impediment on the performance 
of the contract. 
(3) 
The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the 
impediment and its effect on its ability to perform. If the notice is not received by the 
other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought 
to have known of the impediment, it is liable for damages resulting from such non-
receipt. 
(4) 
Nothing in this Article prevents a party from exercising a right to terminate the 
contract or to withhold performance or request interest on money due. 
SECTION 2:     RIGHT TO PERFORMANCE 
ARTICLE  7.2.1 
(Performance of monetary obligation) 
Where a party who is obliged to pay money does not do so, the other party may re-
quire payment. 
ARTICLE  7.2.2 
(Performance of non-monetary obligation) 
Where a party who owes an obligation other than one to pay money does not per-
form, the other party may require performance, unless 
(a) 
performance is impossible in law or in fact; 
(b) 
performance or, where relevant, enforcement is unreasonably burdensome or 
expensive; 
(c) 
the party entitled to performance may reasonably obtain performance from an-
other source; 
(d) 
performance is of an exclusively personal character; or 
(e) 
the party entitled to performance does not require performance within a 
reasonable time after it has, or ought to have, become aware of the non-performance. 
ARTICLE  7.2.3 
(Repair and replacement of defective performance) 
The right to performance includes in appropriate cases the right to require repair, 
replacement, or other cure of defective performance. The provisions of Articles 7.2.1 
and 7.2.2 apply accordingly. 
ARTICLE  7.2.4 
(Judicial penalty) 
(1) 
Where the court orders a party to perform, it may also direct that this party pay 
a penalty if it does not comply with the order. 
(2) 
The penalty shall be paid to the aggrieved party unless mandatory provisions 
of the law of the forum provide otherwise. Payment of the penalty to the aggrieved party 
does not exclude any claim for damages. 
ARTICLE  7.2.5 
(Change of remedy) 
(1) 
An aggrieved party who has required performance of a non-monetary obliga-
tion and who has not received performance within a period fixed or otherwise within a 
reasonable period of time may invoke any other remedy. 
(2) 
Where the decision of a court for performance of a non-monetary obligation 
cannot be enforced, the aggrieved party may invoke any other remedy. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
430 
SECTION  3: TERMINATION 
ARTICLE  7.3.1 
(Right to terminate the contract) 
(1) 
A party may terminate the contract where the failure of the other party to 
perform an obligation under the contract amounts to a fundamental non-performance. 
(2) 
In determining whether a failure to perform an obligation amounts to a funda-
mental non-performance regard shall be had, in particular, to whether 
(a) 
the non-performance substantially deprives the aggrieved party of what it was 
entitled to expect under the contract unless the other party did not foresee and could not 
reasonably have foreseen such result; 
(b) 
strict compliance with the obligation which has not been performed is of 
essence under the contract; 
(c) 
the non-performance is intentional or reckless; 
(d) 
the non-performance gives the aggrieved party reason to believe that it cannot 
rely on the other party’s future performance; 
(e) 
the non-performing party will suffer disproportionate loss as a result of the 
preparation or performance if the contract is terminated. 
(3) 
In the case of delay the aggrieved party may also terminate the contract if the 
other party fails to perform before the time allowed it under Article 7.1.5 has expired. 
ARTICLE  7.3.2 
(Notice of termination) 
(1) 
The right of a party to terminate the contract is exercised by notice to the other 
party. 
(2) 
If performance has been offered late or otherwise does not conform to the 
contract the aggrieved party will lose its right to terminate the contract unless it gives 
notice to the other party within a reasonable time after it has or ought to have become 
aware of the offer or of the non-conforming performance. 
ARTICLE  7.3.3 
(Anticipatory non-performance) 
Where prior to the date for performance by one of the parties it is clear that there 
will be a fundamental non-performance by that party, the other party may terminate the 
contract. 
ARTICLE  7.3.4 
(Adequate assurance of due performance) 
A party who reasonably believes that there will be a fundamental non-performance 
by the other party may demand adequate assurance of due performance and may 
meanwhile withhold its own performance. Where this assurance is not provided within a 
reasonable time the party demanding it may terminate the contract. 
ARTICLE  7.3.5 
(Effects of termination in general) 
(1) 
Termination of the contract releases both parties from their obligation to effect 
and to receive future performance. 
(2) 
Termination does not preclude a claim for damages for non-performance. 
(3) 
Termination does not affect any provision in the contract for the settlement of 
disputes or any other term of the contract which is to operate even after termination. 
 
Annex 
 
431 
ARTICLE  7.3.6 
(Restitution with respect to contracts to be performed at one time) 
(1)  On termination of a contract to be performed at one time either party may 
claim restitution of whatever it has supplied under the contract, provided that such party 
concurrently makes restitution of whatever it has received under the contract. 
(2)  If restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate, an allowance has to be 
made in money whenever reasonable. 
(3)  The recipient of the performance does not have to make an allowance in 
money if the impossibility to make restitution in kind is attributable to the other party. 
(4) Compensation may be claimed for expenses reasonably required to preserve or 
maintain the performance received. 
ARTICLE  7.3.7 
(Restitution with respect to long-term contracts) 
(1) 
On termination of a long-term contract restitution can only be claimed for the 
period after termination has taken effect, provided the contract is divisible. 
(2)  As far as restitution has to be made, the provisions of Article 7.3.6 apply. 
SECTION  4: DAMAGES 
ARTICLE  7.4.1 
(Right to damages) 
Any non-performance gives the aggrieved party a right to damages either 
exclusively or in conjunction with any other remedies except where the non-
performance is excused under these Principles. 
ARTICLE  7.4.2 
(Full compensation) 
(1) 
The aggrieved party is entitled to full compensation for harm sustained as a 
result of the non-performance. Such harm includes both any loss which it suffered and 
any gain of which it was deprived, taking into account any gain to the aggrieved party 
resulting from its avoidance of cost or harm. 
(2) 
Such harm may be non-pecuniary and includes, for instance, physical 
suffering or emotional distress. 
ARTICLE  7.4.3 
(Certainty of harm) 
(1) 
Compensation is due only for harm, including future harm, that is established 
with a reasonable degree of certainty. 
(2) 
Compensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the 
probability of its occurrence. 
(3) 
Where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree 
of certainty, the assessment is at the discretion of the court. 
ARTICLE  7.4.4 
(Foreseeability of harm) 
The non-performing party is liable only for harm which it foresaw or could 
reasonably have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract as being likely to 
result from its non-performance. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
432 
ARTICLE  7.4.5 
(Proof of harm in case of replacement transaction) 
Where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has made a replacement 
transaction within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner it may recover the 
difference between the contract price and the price of the replacement transaction as 
well as damages for any further harm. 
ARTICLE  7.4.6 
(Proof of harm by current price) 
(1) 
Where the aggrieved party has terminated the contract and has not made a 
replacement transaction but there is a current price for the performance contracted for, it 
may recover the difference between the contract price and the price current at the time 
the contract is terminated as well as damages for any further harm. 
(2) 
Current price is the price generally charged for goods delivered or services 
rendered in comparable circumstances at the place where the contract should have been 
performed or, if there is no current price at that place, the current price at such other 
place that appears reasonable to take as a reference. 
ARTICLE  7.4.7 
(Harm due in part to aggrieved party) 
Where the harm is due in part to an act or omission of the aggrieved party or to an-
other event for which that party bears the risk, the amount of damages shall be reduced 
to the extent that these factors have contributed to the harm, having regard to the 
conduct of each of the parties. 
ARTICLE  7.4.8 
(Mitigation of harm) 
(1) 
The non-performing party is not liable for harm suffered by the aggrieved 
party to the extent that the harm could have been reduced by the latter party’s taking 
reasonable steps. 
(2) 
The aggrieved party is entitled to recover any expenses reasonably incurred in 
attempting to reduce the harm. 
ARTICLE  7.4.9 
(Interest for failure to pay money) 
(1) 
If a party does not pay a sum of money when it falls due the aggrieved party is 
entitled to interest upon that sum from the time when payment is due to the time of 
payment whether or not the non-payment is excused. 
(2) 
The rate of interest shall be the average bank short-term lending rate to prime 
borrowers prevailing for the currency of payment at the place for payment, or where no 
such rate exists at that place, then the same rate in the State of the currency of payment. 
In the absence of such a rate at either place the rate of interest shall be the appropriate 
rate fixed by the law of the State of the currency of payment. 
(3) 
The aggrieved party is entitled to additional damages if the non-payment 
caused it a greater harm. 
ARTICLE  7.4.10 
(Interest on damages) 
Unless otherwise agreed, interest on damages for non-performance of non-monetary 
obligations accrues as from the time of non-performance. 
 
Annex 
 
433 
ARTICLE  7.4.11 
(Manner of monetary redress) 
(1) 
Damages are to be paid in a lump sum. However, they may be payable in 
instalments where the nature of the harm makes this appropriate. 
(2) 
Damages to be paid in instalments may be indexed. 
ARTICLE  7.4.12 
(Currency in which to assess damages) 
Damages are to be assessed either in the currency in which the monetary obligation 
was expressed or in the currency in which the harm was suffered, whichever is more 
appropriate. 
ARTICLE  7.4.13 
(Agreed payment for non-performance) 
(1) 
Where the contract provides that a party who does not perform is to pay a 
specified sum to the aggrieved party for such non-performance, the aggrieved party is 
entitled to that sum irrespective of its actual harm. 
(2) 
However, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary the specified sum 
may be reduced to a reasonable amount where it is grossly excessive in relation to the 
harm resulting from the non-performance and to the other circumstances. 
CHAPTER  8 — SET-OFF 
ARTICLE  8.1 
(Conditions of set-off) 
(1) 
Where two parties owe each other money or other performances of the same 
kind, either of them (“the first party”) may set off its obligation against that of its 
obligee (“the other party”) if at the time of set-off, 
(a) 
the first party is entitled to perform its obligation; 
(b) 
the other party’s obligation is ascertained as to its existence and amount and 
performance is due. 
(2) 
If the obligations of both parties arise from the same contract, the first party 
may also set off its obligation against an obligation of the other party which is not 
ascertained as to its existence or to its amount.  
ARTICLE  8.2 
(Foreign currency set-off) 
Where the obligations are to pay money in different currencies, the right of set-off 
may be exercised, provided that both currencies are freely convertible and the parties 
have not agreed that the first party shall pay only in a specified currency. 
ARTICLE  8.3 
(Set-off by notice) 
The right of set-off is exercised by notice to the other party. 
ARTICLE  8.4 
(Content of notice) 
(1) 
The notice must specify the obligations to which it relates. 
(2) 
If the notice does not specify the obligation against which set-off is exercised, 
the other party may, within a reasonable time, declare to the first party the obligation to 
which set-off relates. If no such declaration is made, the set-off will relate to all the 
obligations proportionally.  
UNIDROIT Principles 
434 
ARTICLE  8.5 
(Effect of set-off) 
(1) 
Set-off discharges the obligations. 
(2) 
If obligations differ in amount, set-off discharges the obligations up to the 
amount of the lesser obligation. 
(3) 
Set-off takes effect as from the time of notice. 
CHAPTER  9 — ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS, TRANSFER OF OBLIGATIONS, 
ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS 
SECTION  1: ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS 
ARTICLE  9.1.1 
(Definitions) 
“Assignment of a right” means the transfer by agreement from one person (the 
“assignor”) to another person (the “assignee”), including transfer by way of security, of 
the assignor’s right to payment of a monetary sum or other performance from a third 
person (“the obligor”). 
ARTICLE  9.1.2  
(Exclusions) 
This Section does not apply to transfers made under the special rules governing the 
transfers: 
(a)  of instruments such as negotiable instruments, documents of title or financial 
instruments, or 
(b) 
of rights in the course of transferring a business.  
ARTICLE  9.1.3  
(Assignability of non-monetary rights) 
A right to non-monetary performance may be assigned only if the assignment does 
not render the obligation significantly more burdensome. 
ARTICLE  9.1.4  
(Partial assignment) 
(1) 
A right to the payment of a monetary sum may be assigned partially.  
(2) 
A right to other performance may be assigned partially only if it is divisible, 
and the assignment does not render the obligation significantly more burdensome. 
ARTICLE  9.1.5  
(Future rights) 
A future right is deemed to be transferred at the time of the agreement, provided the 
right, when it comes into existence, can be identified as the right to which the 
assignment relates. 
ARTICLE  9.1.6  
(Rights assigned without individual specification) 
A number of rights may be assigned without individual specification, provided such 
rights can be identified as rights to which the assignment relates at the time of the 
assignment or when they come into existence. 
 
Annex 
 
435 
ARTICLE  9.1.7  
(Agreement between assignor and assignee sufficient) 
(1) 
A right is assigned by mere agreement between the assignor and the assignee,

The consent of the obligor is not required unless the obligation in the circum-
stances is of an essentially personal character. 
ARTICLE  9.1.8  
(Obligor’s additional costs) 
The obligor has a right to be compensated by the assignor or the assignee for any 
additional costs caused by the assignment. 
ARTICLE  9.1.9  
(Non-assignment clauses) 
(1) 
The assignment of a right to the payment of a monetary sum is effective 
notwithstanding an agreement between the assignor and the obligor limiting or 
prohibiting such an assignment. However, the assignor may be liable to the obligor for 
breach of contract. 
(2) 
The assignment of a right to other performance is ineffective if it is contrary to 
an agreement between the assignor and the obligor limiting or prohibiting the 
assignment. Nevertheless, the assignment is effective if the assignee, at the time of the 
assignment, neither knew nor ought to have known of the agreement. The assignor may 
then be liable to the obligor for breach of contract. 
ARTICLE  9.1.10  
(Notice to the obligor) 
(1) 
Until the obligor receives a notice of the assignment from either the assignor 
or the assignee, it is discharged by paying the assignor. 
(2) 
After the obligor receives such a notice, it is discharged only by paying the 
assignee. 
ARTICLE  9.1.11  
(Successive assignments) 
If the same right has been assigned by the same assignor to two or more successive 
assignees, the obligor is discharged by paying according to the order in which the 
notices were received. 
ARTICLE  9.1.12 
(Adequate proof of assignment) 
(1) 
If notice of the assignment is given by the assignee, the obligor may request 
the assignee to provide within a reasonable time adequate proof that the assignment has 
been made.  
(2) 
Until adequate proof is provided, the obligor may withhold payment.  
(3) 
Unless adequate proof is provided, notice is not effective.  
(4) 
Adequate proof includes, but is not limited to, any writing emanating from the 
assignor and indicating that the assignment has taken place. 
ARTICLE  9.1.13  
(Defences and rights of set-off) 
(1) 
The obligor may assert against the assignee all defences that the obligor could 
assert against the assignor. 
(2) 
The obligor may exercise against the assignee any right of set-off available to 
the obligor against the assignor up to the time notice of assignment was received.  
UNIDROIT Principles 
436 
ARTICLE  9.1.14  
(Rights related to the right assigned)

all the assignor’s rights to payment or other performance under the contract in 
respect of the right assigned, and 
(b) 
all rights securing performance of the right assigned.  
ARTICLE  9.1.15  
(Undertakings of the assignor)

the assignor is entitled to assign the right; 
(c) 
the right has not been previously assigned to another assignee, and it is free 
from any right or claim from a third party;

the obligor does not have any defences; 
(e) 
neither the obligor nor the assignor has given notice of set-off concerning the 
assigned right and will not give any such notice; 
(f) 
the assignor will reimburse the assignee for any payment received from the 
obligor before notice of the assignment was given.

this person will perform the obligation in place of the obligor, unless the obligation in the 
circumstances has an essentially personal character.  
(2) 
The obligee retains its claim against the obligor. 
ARTICLE  9.2.7 
(Defences and rights of set-off) 
(1) 
The new obligor may assert against the obligee all defences which the original 
obligor could assert against the obligee. 
(2) 
The new obligor may not exercise against the obligee any right of set-off 
available to the original obligor against the obligee. 
ARTICLE  9.2.8  
(Rights related to the obligation transferred) 
(1) 
The obligee may assert against the new obligor all its rights to payment or 
other performance under the contract in respect of the obligation transferred. 
(2) 
If the original obligor is discharged under Article 9.2.5(1), a security granted 
by any person other than the new obligor for the performance of the obligation is 
discharged, unless that other person agrees that it should continue to be available to the 
obligee. 
(3) 
Discharge of the original obligor also extends to any security of the original 
obligor given to the obligee for the performance of the obligation, unless the security is 
over an asset which is transferred as part of a transaction between the original obligor 
and the new obligor.  
SECTION  3: ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS 
ARTICLE  9.3.1

The running of the limitation period is suspended 
(a) 
when the obligee performs any act, by commencing judicial proceedings or in 
judicial proceedings already instituted, that is recognised by the law of the court as 
asserting the obligee’s right against the obligor; 
(b) 
in the case of the obligor’s insolvency when the obligee has asserted its rights 
in the insolvency proceedings; or 
(c) 
in the case of proceedings for dissolution of the entity which is the obligor 
when the obligee has asserted its rights in the dissolution proceedings. 
(2) 
Suspension lasts until a final decision has been issued or until the proceedings 
have been otherwise terminated.

The running of the limitation period is suspended when the obligee performs

as not to expire before one year after the relevant impediment has ceased to exist.  
(2) 
Where the impediment consists of the incapacity or death of the obligee or 
obligor, suspension ceases when a representative for the incapacitated or deceased party 
or its estate has been appointed or a successor has inherited the respective party’s 
position. The additional one-year period under paragraph (1) applies accordingly. 
ARTICLE  10.9 
(Effects of expiration of limitation period) 
(1) 
The expiration of the limitation period does not extinguish the right. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
440 
(2) 
For the expiration of the limitation period to have effect, the obligor must 
assert it as a defence.

obligation;  
(b)  the obligations are separate when each obligor is bound only for its share. 
ARTICLE  11.1.2  
(Presumption of joint and several obligations) 
When several obligors are bound by the same obligation towards an obligee, they 
are presumed to be jointly and severally bound, unless the circumstances indicate 
otherwise.

co-obligors, but may not assert defences or rights of set-off that are personal to one or 
several of the other co-obligors. 
ARTICLE  11.1.5  
(Effect of performance or set-off) 
Performance or set-off by a joint and several obligor or set-off by the obligee against

Annex 
 
441 
ARTICLE  11.1.6  
(Effect of release or settlement)

several obligor, discharges all the other obligors for the share of the released or settling 
obligor, unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.

several obligor does not affect: 
(a)  the obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors; or 
(b)  the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under Article 
11.1.10.  
(2)  If the obligee initiates proceedings under Articles 10.5, 10.6 or 10.7 against

against the other joint and several obligors. 
ARTICLE  11.1.8  
(Effect of judgment) 
(1)  A decision by a court as to the liability to the obligee of one joint and several 
obligor does not affect: 
(a)  the obligations to the obligee of the other joint and several obligors; or 
(b)  the rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under Article 
11.1.10.  
(2)  However, the other joint and several obligors may rely on such a decision, 
except if it was based on grounds personal to the obligor concerned. In such a case, the 
rights of recourse between the joint and several obligors under Article 11.1.10 are 
affected accordingly. 
ARTICLE  11.1.9

co-obligors to the extent of the unperformed part, with precedence over co-obligors 
exercising contributory claims. 
UNIDROIT Principles 
442 
ARTICLE  11.1.12  
(Defences in contributory claims) 
A joint and several obligor against whom a claim is made by the co-obligor who has

asserted by the co-obligor against the obligee ; 
(b)  may assert defences which are personal to itself ; 
(c)  may not assert defences and rights of set-off which are personal to one or 
several of the other co-obligors. 
ARTICLE  11.1.13  
(Inability to recover) 
If a joint and several obligor who has performed more than that obligor’s share is 
unable, despite all reasonable efforts, to recover contribution from another joint and 
several obligor, the share of the others, including the one who has performed, is 
increased proportionally.

ARTICLE  11.2.2  
(Effects of joint and several claims) 
Full performance of an obligation in favour of one of the joint and several obligees 
discharges the obligor towards the other obligees.

(1)  The obligor may assert against any of the joint and several obligees all the 
defences and rights of set-off that are personal to its relationship to that obligee or that it
