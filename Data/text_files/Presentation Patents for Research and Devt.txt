B. Roles of the patent system
� Encourage technological innovation by rewarding intellectual creativity
�
in providing protection for the invention to the patent owner, patents provide
incentives to individuals by offering them recognition for their creativity and the
possibility of obtaining financial rewards if they commercialize or exploit their
inventions
� Promote competition and investment
�
in developing new or improved products or processes by encouraging research
and development
� Encourage dissemination of information
�
because information disclosed in patents is published and that may be of benefit to
society
� Promote technology transfer
�
because anyone can find patented technologies that they may want to get access
to and use themselves

C.Novelty
� In Europe and in the main countries, an invention must be new at the date of
filing a patent application (absolute novelty). An invention shall be considered
"new" if it does not form part of the "state of the art“.

to
the
public

the patent application.
� There
must
have
been
no
public
disclosure

an
invention
before the filing date of the patent application.
So keep your invention confidential!

Legal and IP Department | Confidential
A. Where to file a patent application?
� There are different routes to patent protection:
� National patent offices
- National patent valid only in the country where it is granted
- Non-nationals can also apply for a patent
- One year of "priority" for subsequent applications
� European Patent Office (EPO)
- A "European patent" is equivalent to national patents in the countries for which it was
granted
- The applicant chooses the countries
- The cost depends on the number of countries designated
� Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)
- Just one initial application for more than 140 contracting states
- After the international phase, the international application leads to multiple national patent
examination procedures
- Costly patenting decisions can be delayed by up to 30-31 months after filing
- No international patent, but an international patent application procedure
- PCT application can be filed at a national patent office, EPO or WIPO

the prior art documents as X (novelty), Y (inventive step), A (technological background)…
� Publication of application and search report
-
Publication 18 months after the patent filing date (or priority date).
