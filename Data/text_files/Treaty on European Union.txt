which are justified on grounds of public policy
or public security.

prejudice to the applicability of restrictions on the
right of establishment which are compatible with this
Treaty.
3. The measures and procedures referred to in para­
graphs

arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on
the free movement of capital and payments as
defined in Article 73b.

By way of derogation from Article 73b, Member
States which, on 31 December 1993, enjoy a dero­

safeguard measures with regard to third countries

European
Parliament
of
any
such
decision taken by the Council.

creditor or the beneficiary resides, any payments
connected with the movement of goods, services
or capital, and any transfers of capital and
earnings, to the extent that the movement of
goods, services,
capital
and persons between
Member States has been liberalized pursuant to
this Treaty.
The Member States declare their readiness to
undertake the liberalization of payments beyond
the
extent

employment in certain areas and on the operation of
transport facilities, they shall be laid down by the
Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the
Commission,
after
consulting
the
European
Parliament
and
the
Economic

government deficit to gross domestic product
exceeds a reference value, unless
— either the ratio has declined substantially and
continuously and reached a level that comes
close to the reference value ;
— or,
alternatively,
the
excess
over
the
reference
value
is
only
exceptional
and
temporary and the ratio remains close to the
reference value ;

effective action in response to its recommendations
within the period laid down, the Council may make

practice the recommendations of the Council, the
Council may decide to give notice to the Member
State to take, within a specified time limit, measures
for the deficit reduction which is judged necessary
by the Council in order to remedy the situation.
In such a case, the Council may request the Member
State concerned to submit reports in accordance
with a specific timetable in order to examine the
adjustment efforts of that Member State.
10. The rights to bring actions provided for in
Articles 169 and 170 may not be exercised within the

invite the European Investment Bank to
reconsider
its
lending
policy
towards

a non-interest-bearing deposit of an appropriate
size with the Community until the excessive
deficit has, in the view of the Council, been
corrected ;

Council
shall

decision under paragraph
8 has been abrogated,
make a public statement that an excessive deficit in

consulting the Committee referred to in Article
109c, recommend to the Council the granting of

authorization
may

common market and must not be wider in scope
than is strictly necessary to remedy the sudden diffi­
culties which have arisen.
2. The Commission and the other Member States
shall be informed of such protective measures not

Article 109j
1 . The Commission and the EMI shall report to the
Council on the progress made in the fulfilment by
the Member States of their obligations regarding the
achievement of economic
and
monetary union.
These reports shall include an examination of the
compatibility between each Member State's national
legislation, including the statutes of its national
central bank, and Articles 107 and 108 of this Treaty
and the Statute of the ESCB. The reports shall also
examine the achievement of a high degree of
sustainable
convergence
by
reference
to
the
fulfilment by each Member State of the following
criteria :
— the achievement of a high degree of price
stability; this will be apparent from a rate of
inflation which is close to that of, at most, the
three best performing Member States in terms of
price stability;
— the sustainability of the government financial
position ; this will be apparent from having
achieved
a
government
budgetary
position
without a deficit that is excessive as determined
in accordance with Article 104c(6);
— the observance of the normal fluctuation margins
provided for by the Exchange Rate Mechanism
of the European Monetary System, for at least
two
years,
without
devaluing
against
the
currency of any other Member State;
— the durability of convergence achieved by the
Member State and of its participation in the
Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European
Monetary
System
being
reflected
in
the
long-term interest rate levels.
The four criteria mentioned in this paragraph and
the relevant periods over which they are to be
respected
are developed further
in
a Protocol
annexed
to
this
Treaty.
The
reports
of
the
Commission and the EMI shall also take account of
the development of the ECU, the results of the inte­
gration of markets, the situation and development of
the balances of payments on current account and an
examination of the development of unit labour costs
and other price indices .

by a qualified majority on a recommendation from
the Commission, shall assess :
— for each Member State, whether it fulfils the
necessary conditions for the adoption of a single

the necessary conditions for the adoption of a
single currency,
and recommend its findings to the Council, meeting
in the composition of the Heads of State or of
Government. The European Parliament shall be
consulted and forward its opinion to the Council,
meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or
of Government.

Parliament referred to in paragraph 2, the Council,
meeting in the composition of Heads of State or of
Government, shall, acting by a qualified majority,

taking into account the reports referred to in
paragraph
1
and the opinion of the European
Parliament, shall, acting by a qualified majority and

referred to in paragraph 2, confirm which Member
States
fulfil
the
necessary
conditions
for
the
adoption of a single currency.

representatives of the Member States without a
derogation weighted in accordance with Article
148(2), and unanimity of those Member States shall

gation, the number of members of the Executive
Board may be smaller than provided for in
Article 11.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, but in
no circumstances shall it be less than four.
As soon as the Executive Board is appointed, the
ESCB and the ECB shall be established and shall

Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. The full
exercise of their powers shall start from the first day
of the third stage.

referred to in Article 45 of the Statute of the ESCB
shall be constituted as a third decision-making body
of the ECB.
4. At the starting date of the third stage, the Council
shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member
States without a derogation, on a proposal from the
Commission and after consulting the ECB, adopt
the conversion rates at which their currencies shall
be irrevocably fixed and at which irrevocably fixed
rate
the
ECU
shall
be
substituted
for
these

the other measures necessary for the rapid intro­
duction of the ECU as the single currency of those
Member States.
5. If it is decided, according to the procedure set out

Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the
Member
States
without
a
derogation
and

the
conduct
of
policy,
in

States may take the necessary measures as a matter of
urgency having regard to the general objectives of the
joint action. The Member State concerned shall

it
shall
consult

mendation.

1993 a report on measures designed to improve public access to the information available to
the institutions.

DECLARATION
on estimated costs under Commission proposals
The Conference notes that the Commission undertakes, by basing itself where appropriate on
any consultations it considers necessary and by strengthening its system for evaluating
Community legislation, to take account in its legislative proposals of costs and benefits to the
Member States' public authorities and all the parties concerned.
DECLARATION
on the implementation of Community law
1 . The Conference stresses that it is central to the coherence and unity of the process of
European construction that each Member State should fully and accurately transpose into
national law the Community Directives addressed to it within the deadlines laid down therein.
Moreover, the Conference, while recognizing that it must be for each Member State to
determine how the provisions of Community law can best be enforced in the light of its own
particular institutions, legal system and other circumstances, but in any event in compliance
with Article 189 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, considers it essential for
the proper functioning of the Community that the measures taken by the different Member
States should result in Community law being applied with the same effectiveness and rigour as
in the application of their national law.
2. The Conference calls on the Commission to ensure, in exercising its powers under Article
155 of this Treaty, that Member States fulfil their obligations. It asks the Commission to
publish periodically a full report for the Member States and the European Parliament.
DECLARATION
on assessment of the environmental impact of Community measures
The Conference notes that the Commission undertakes in its proposals, and that the Member
States undertake in implementing those proposals, to take full account of their environmental
impact and of the principle of sustainable growth.
DECLARATION
on the Court of Auditors
The Conference emphasizes the special importance it attaches to the task assigned to the Court
of Auditors by Articles 188a, 188b, 188c and 206 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community.
It requests the other Community institutions to consider, together with the Court of Auditors,
all appropriate ways of enhancing the effectiveness of its work.

DECLARATION
on the Economic and Social Committee
The Conference agrees that the Economic and Social Committee will enjoy the same inde­
pendence with regard to its budget and staff management as the Court of Auditors has enjoyed
hitherto.
DECLARATION
on cooperation with charitable associations
The Conference stresses the importance, in pursuing the objectives of Article 117 of the Treaty
establishing the European Community, of cooperation between the latter and charitable associ­
ations and foundations as institutions responsible for social welfare establishments and services.
DECLARATION
on the protection of animals
The Conference calls upon the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well
as the Member States, when drafting and implementing Community legislation on the common
agricultural policy, transport, the internal market and research, to pay full regard to the
welfare requirements of animals.
DECLARATION
on the representation of the interests of the overseas countries and territories referred to in
Article 227(3) and (5)(a) and (b) of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference, noting that in exceptional circumstances divergences may arise between the
interests of the Union and those of the overseas countries and territories referred to in Article
227(3) and (5)(a) and (b), agrees that the Council will seek to reach a solution which accords
with the position of the Union. However, in the event that this proves impossible, the
Conference agrees that the Member State concerned may act separately in the interests of the
said overseas countries and territories, without this affecting the Community's interests. The
Member State concerned will give notice to the Council and the Commission where such a
divergence of interests is likely to occur and, when separate action proves unavoidable, make it
clear that it is acting in the interests of an overseas territory mentioned above.
This declaration also applies to Macao and East Timor.

DECLARATION
on the outermost regions of the Community
The Conference acknowledges that the outermost regions of the Community (the French
overseas departments, Azores and Madeira and Canary Islands) suffer from major structural
backwardness compounded by several phenomena (remoteness, island status, small size,
difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products), the permanence
and combination of which severely restrain their economic and social development.
It considers that, while the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and
secondary legislation apply automatically to the outermost regions, it is nonetheless possible to
adopt specific measures to assist them inasmuch and as long as there is an objective need to
take such measures with a view to the economic and social development of those regions. Such
measures should have as their aim both the completion of the internal market and a recognition
of the regional reality to enable the outermost regions to achieve the average economic and
social level of the Community.
DECLARATION
on voting in the field of the common foreign and security policy
The Conference agrees that, with regard to Council decisions requiring unanimity, Member
States will, to the extent possible, avoid preventing a unanimous decision where a qualified
majority exists in favour of that decision.
DECLARATION
on practical arrangements in the field of the common foreign and security policy
The Conference agrees that the division of work between the Political Committee and the
Committee of Permanent Representatives will be examined at a later stage, as will the practical
arrangements for merging the Political Cooperation Secretariat with the General Secretariat of
the Council and for cooperation between the latter and the Commission.
DECLARATION
on the use of languages in the field of the common foreign and security policy
The Conference agrees that the use of languages shall be in accordance with the rules of the
European Communities.
For COREU communications, the current practice of European Political Cooperation will
serve as a guide for the time being.
All common foreign and security policy texts which are submitted to or adopted at meetings of
the European Council and of the Council as well as all texts which are to be published are
immediately and simultaneously translated into all the official Community languages.

DECLARATION
on Western European Union
The Conference notes the following declarations :
I. Declaration by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which are members
of the Western European Union and also members of the European Union on die role of the
Western European Union and its relations with the European Union and with the Atlantic
Alliance
Introduction
1 . WEU Member States agree on the need to develop a genuine European security and
defence identity and a greater European responsibility on defence matters, litis identity will be
pursued through a gradual process involving successive phases. WEU will form an integral part
of the process of the development of the European Union and will enhance its contribution to
solidarity within the Atlantic Alliance. WEU Member States agree to strengthen the role of
WEU, in the longer term perspective of a common defence policy within the European Union
which might in time lead to a common defence, compatible with that of the Atlantic Alliance.
2 . WEU will be developed as the defence component of the European Union and as a means
to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance. To this end, it will formulate
common European defence policy and carry forward its concrete implementation through the
further development of its own operational role.
WEU Member States take note of Article J.4 relating to the common foreign and security
policy of the Treaty on European Union which reads as follows :
* 1 . The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the
security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which
might in time lead to a common defence.
2. The Union requests the Western European Union (WEU), which is an integral part of
the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the
Union which have defence implications. The Council shall, in agreement with the
institutions of the WEU, adopt the necessary practical arrangements.
3 . Issues having defence implications dealt with under this Article shall not be subject to
the procedures set out in Article J.3.
4. The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific
character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the
obligations of certain Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible
with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.
5. The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of closer cooperation
between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the WEU
and the Atlantic Alliance, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede
that provided for in this Title.
6. With a view to furthering the objective of this Treaty, and having in view the date of
1998 in the context of Article XII of the Brussels Treaty, the provisions of this Article may
No C 191/ 106

29. 7. 92
be revised as provided for in Article N(2) on the basis of a report to be presented in 1996
by the Council to the European Council, which shall include an evaluation of the progress
made and the experience gained until then.'
A. WElf's relations with European Union
3. The objective is to build up WEU in stages as the defence component of the European
Union. To this end, WEU is prepared, at the request of the European Union, to elaborate and
implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.
To this end, WEU will take the following measures to develop a close working relationship
with the Union :
— as appropriate, synchronization of the dates and venues of meetings and harmonization of
working methods ;
— establishment of close cooperation between the Council and Secretariat-General of WEU
on the one hand, and the Council of the Union and General Secretariat of the Council on
the other;
— consideration of the harmonization of the sequence and duration of the respective
Presidencies;
— arranging for appropriate modalities so as to ensure that the Commission of the European
Communities is regularly informed and, as appropriate, consulted on WEU activities in
accordance with the role of the Commission in the common foreign and security policy as
defined in the Treaty on European Union ;
— encouragement of closer cooperation between the Parliamentary Assembly of WEU and the
European Parliament.
The WEU Council shall, in agreement with the competent bodies of the European Union,
adopt the necessary practical arrangements.
B. WElfs relations with the Atlantic Alliance
4. The objective is to develop WEU as a means to strengthen the European pillar of the
Atlantic Alliance. Accordingly WEU is prepared to develop further the close working links
between WEU and the Alliance and to strengthen the role, responsibilities and contributions of
WEU Member States in the Alliance. This will be undertaken on the basis of the necessary
transparency and complementarity between the emerging European security and defence
identity and the Alliance. WEU will act in conformity with the positions adopted in the
Atlantic Alliance.
— WEU Member States will intensify their coordination on Alliance issues which represent an
important common interest with the aim of introducing joint positions agreed in WEU into
the process of consultation in the Alliance which will remain the essential forum for consul­
tation among its members and the venue for agreement on policies bearing on the security
and defence commitments of Allies under the North Atlantic Treaty.
— Where necessary, dates and venues of meetings will be synchronized and working methods
harmonized.
— Close cooperation will be established between the Secretariats-General of WEU and
NATO.
C. Operational role of WEU
5. WEU's operational role will be strengthened by examining and defining appropriate
missions, structures and means, covering in particular:
— WEU planning cell ;
— closer military cooperation complementary to the Alliance in particular in the fields of
logistics, transport, training and strategic surveillance ;
29. 7. 92
Official Journal of the European Communities
No C 191/ 107
—- meetings of WEU Chiefs of Defence Staff;
— military units answerable to WEU.
Other proposals will be examined further, including :
— enhanced cooperation in the field of armaments with the aim of creating a European
armaments agency ;
— development of the WEU Institute into a European Security and Defence Academy.
Arrangements aimed at giving WEU a stronger operational role will be fully compatible with
the military dispositions necessary to ensure the collective defence of all Allies.
D. Other measures
6. As a consequence of the measures set out above, and in order to facilitate the strengthening
of WEU's role, the seat of the WEU Council and Secretariat will be transferred to Brussels.
7. Representation on the WEU Council must be such that the Council is able to exercise its
functions continuously in accordance with Article VIII of the modified Brussels Treaty.
Member States may draw on a double-hatting formula, to be worked out, consisting of their
representatives to the Alliance and to the European Union.
8 . WEU notes that, in accordance with the provisions of Article J.4(6) concerning the common
foreign and security policy of the Treaty on European Union, the Union will decide to review
the provisions of this Article with a view to furthering the objective to be set by it in
accordance with the procedure defined. The WEU will re-examine the present provisions in
1996. This re-examination will take account of the progress and experience acquired and will
extend to relations between WEU and the Atlantic Alliance.
II. Declaration by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and tike United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which are members of
the Western European Union
The Member States of WEU welcome the development of the European security and defence
identity. They are determined, taking into account the role of WEU as the defence component
of the European Union and as the means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic
Alliance, to put the relationship between WEU and the other European States on a new basis
for the sake of stability and security in Europe. In this spirit, they propose the following :
States which are members of the European Union are invited to accede to WEU on conditions
to be agreed in accordance with Article XI of the modified Brussels Treaty, or to become
observers if they so wish. Simultaneously, other European Member States of NATO are invited
to become associate members of WEU in a way which will give them the possibility of partici­
pating fully in the activities of WEU.
The Member States of WEU assume that treaties and agreements corresponding with the above
proposals will be concluded before 31 December 1992.'

on asylum
1 . The Conference agrees that, in the context of the proceedings provided for in Articles K.l
and K.3 of the provisions on cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs, the Council
will consider as a matter of priority questions concerning Member States' asylum policies, with
the aim of adopting, by the beginning of 1993, common action to harmonize aspects of them,
in the light of the work programme and timetable contained in the report on asylum drawn up
at the request of the European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 28 and 29 June 1991 .

report, the possibility of applying Article K.9 to such matters.
DECLARATION
on police cooperation
The Conference confirms the agreement of the Member States on the objectives underlying the
German delegation's proposals at the European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 28 and 29
June 1991 .
For the present, the Member States agree to examine as a matter of priority the drafts
submitted to them, on the basis of the work programme and timetable agreed upon in the
report drawn up at the request of the Luxembourg European Council, and they are willing to
envisage the adoption of practical measures in areas such as those suggested by the German
delegation, relating to the following functions in the exchange of information and experience :
— support for national criminal investigation and security authorities, in particular in the coor­
dination of investigations and search operations;
— creation of data bases ;
— central analysis and assessment of information in order to take stock of the situation and
identify investigative approaches ;
— collection and analysis of national prevention programmes for forwarding to Member
States and for drawing up Europe-wide prevention strategies;
— measures relating to further training, research, forensic matters and criminal records
departments.
Member States agree to consider on the basis of a report, during 1994 at the latest, whether
the scope of such cooperation should be extended.
DECLARATION
on disputes between the ECB and the EMI and their servants
The Conference considers it proper that the Court of First Instance should hear this class of
action in accordance with Article 168a of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
The Conference therefore invites the institutions to adapt the relevant rules accordingly.
