        "answer": "A MANE Commercial Representative is appointed to assist for the promotion and sale of MANE’s products (fragrances/ flavours/ ingredients), within a limited territory (country, region, city…) for a specific market (fragrance/ flavour for the food/ cosmetic/ personal care/ home care, and less frequently, in fine fragrance, pharmaceutical, tobacco, pet food, and oral care industries), and grow MANE’s direct sales accordingly. A MANE Distributor is appointed to resell “as is” some of MANE’s products (fragrances/ flavours/ ingredients), within a limited territory (country, region, city…) for a specific market (fragrance/ flavour for the food/ cosmetic/ personal care/ home care, and less frequently, in fine fragrance, pharmaceutical, tobacco, pet food, and oral care industries) to its own customers."

This gives the advantage of termination rights to MANE. If Commercial Representative or the Distributor is unable to meet the sales target for flavour but achieve the target for fragrance, then MANE can terminate the flavour agreement only and retain the fragrance agreement."

        "question": "What are the steps to follow?",
        "answer": "First, the Contract Administration Coordinator must carefully read the agreement in its entirety, in order to identify every element not (i) compliant with Mane’s practices or reality, or (ii) acceptable from an operational standpoint. Consequently, the Contract Administration Coordinator will identify the terms of the contract to be validated by the appropriate department.After this examination, the Coordinator shall fill in the « Form for commercial contract review », and identify in such form the collaborators from the different Mane departments (one collaborator per department) must validate or modify some parts of the draft agreement.The Coordinator will email the contract to be reviewed, in an editable version in French, English or Spanish, the completed in form and if any, the documents targeted in the agreement, to every person that shall review the contract (one maximum per department) as identified in the form. The Coordinator will specify in his email a deadline for the receipt of the comments by the operational staff, so that the Legal & IP Department will have reasonable time to review and if necessary, modify the agreement once all comments are received.The Coordinator follows up regularly the feedbacks received and if necessary, sends a reminder to those who failed to send their feedbacks.The Coordinator centralizes the feedbacks and sends the comments and consolidated decisions to the Legal & IP Department for a final review of the document. The Legal & IP department sends a modified version of the agreement to the Coordinator, who will send it back to the counterparty.The Coordinator negotiates with the counterparty, being reminded that certain terms are solely to the Legal &IP Department’s discretion and not left to acceptance by operational staff. The Legal & IP Department cannot contact (or be silently present on a call) the counterparty’s commercial staff without the counterparty’s legal department being present. The Legal & IP Department will not act as the point of contact for Mane, it is solely the responsibility of the Coordinator. If the modifications of the agreement requested by Mane are not all accepted, the points of disagreements shall be reviewed following the same process: validation by the operational staff, followed by the Legal & IP Department’s final review.The Coordinator is in charge of the signature process of the final agreement as accepted by Mane and the counterparty.Mane prefers original “wet ink” signatures when feasible. However, situations will arise where an electronic signature is required due to counterparty’s demands or practicalities of the situation. In these situations, a duly certified electronic signature may be arranged on a case-by-case basis.Once the agreement duly initialed and signed by the parties, is received by the Coordinator, he must:Scan it and keep a digital copy, send it to all the Mane departments concerned by the agreement and to the Legal & IP Department (the Legal Counsel in charge of the review),Send one hard copy of the signed agreement to the Legal & IP Department, and the other hard copy – or others in case of plural parties – to the counterparty, being reminded that it is necessary to have as many original hard copies as there are parties to the agreement(s)."

The Legal & IP Department should not be copied on  the e-mails to the counterparty and the e-mail address of the Legal Counsel in charge of the review should not be communicated to the counterparty for other purposes than direct contact with the counterparty’s Legal Department and subject to the Legal Counsel’s prior approval."

        "answer": "A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new product or way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a technical problem. Patents protect the features and processes that make things work. Patent rights let inventors profit from their inventions. Patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner’s consent.  Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop patent infringement. Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party."

        "question": "What information is necessary to identify an inventor?",
        "answer": "The determination of inventorship is a legal conclusion based on facts.  Accordingly, specific details characterizing each contributor's work on the project must be detailed in the Patentability Study Request Form. While most, if not all, patent statutes around the world fail to provide a precise definition of \"inventor,\" it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features (i.e., novel and/or non-obvious) of the invention. Conception, which is the key to inventorship, may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice. And because inventions are defined by the claims, an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that (s)he conceived. Additionally, those claim element(s) must be one of the inventive (novel or non-obvious) elements. If requested, the project leader may be required to submit evidence of contribution for each person, e.g., laboratory notebook pages or reports, showing the conception of at least one inventive element of the claimed invention."

        "question": "My colleague and I worked together on the project, who is the inventor?",
        "answer": "When two or more people collaborate in conceiving a claimed invention, then those people are joint inventors. Each joint inventor must be aware of the contribution of the other and each must contribute to the formation of the solution to a problem that is the invention. Thus, joint inventorship is the process by which people cooperate to solve a problem and in which each person makes some mental contribution to the final conception of the solution. The entire inventive concept need not occur to each of the joint inventors and they need not physically work on the project together or at the same time. Nor do their contributions need to be the same or equal. All that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application. Please note that merely being present during a meeting, providing research support, setting up experiments at the instruction of another, analytical testing, or simply instructing others to perform research does not, by itself, indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention."

        "_id": "655417a005185edcbd5428c6",
        "question": "Who is responsible for identifying inventors?",
        "answer": "Patent Counsel at MANE bears the responsibility, in association with preparing a patent application, to identifying the inventor(s). Consequently, successfully identifying inventor(s) involves assessing the nature of contribution by each person. This assessment is necessary to permit the applicant to meet its legal obligation in most, if not all, of the national patent offices to provide to an accurate listing of inventors on a patent application. Failure to provide an accurate list of inventors may, in some circumstances, compromise the validity and enforceability of the resulting patent. Inadvertently naming or omitting an inventor is generally a correctable error, but intentionally naming or omitting an inventor can result in the patent being found unenforceable against alleged infringers."

        "answer": "The Subject Matter describes the purpose of the exchange of confidential information with the counterparty.  It is especially important to define this properly because it (i) establishes what information is covered (i.e. only information shared that pertains to the Subject Matter is protected under the agreement), and (ii) limits how the other party can use the information (i.e. use of the confidential information is restricted to activities consistent with the Subject Matter). The Subject Matter must be defined precisely as much as possible in order to provide clarity on the confidential information that is to be protected. Example:  The Parties intend to investigate a possible business relationship regarding Mane’s development and proposal of fragrance compositions and delivery systems thereof for integration by Customer into its own hair care products and shall commence mutual discussions relating thereto.

Even if a new CDA is needed, it may nevertheless be necessary to state in the new contract that the old CDA remains valid, so it is not superseded.

        "question": "What information is necessary for initiating a patentability study?",
        "answer": "The purpose of a patentability study is to assess the likelihood of obtaining a granted patent having meaningful protection.  Thus, in order to assess patentability of a new product or process, the inventors/contributors must provide patent counsel with specific details of the product or process, including an explanation of the technical problem being solved, successful and unsuccessful experiments, known prior art, and how the new product or process is different from old or known products or processes. After studying the provided details, the new product or process is defined by one or more hypothetical claims, which are then evaluated by comparing the hypothetical claim(s) to the prior art.  Prior art is any evidence (information) that the invention was already publicly known or available, in whole or in part, before the effective filing date of the patent application, and includes publicly available information, such as published patent documents, scientific journal articles, web pages, technical data sheets, etc."

        "question": "What happens after a patentability study?",

The report will conclude with a recommendation to proceed (or not) with the preparation and filing of patent application. Because the patenting system requires disclosure of the technical details of the invention in exchange for a chance at obtaining patent rights, there is a risk of disclosure without any patent rights. As such, in some instances and prior to making a favorable recommendation, R&D may be asked to perform additional testing or experiments to enhance MANE's chances for obtaining a granted patent."

        "question": "What is involved with preparing a patent application?",
        "answer": "The process for preparing a patent application involves a collaboration between patent counsel and the inventor(s). Patent counsel will generally begin the process by preparing a set of claims describing the metes and bounds of the invention, and then build the remaining sections of the patent application therefrom to provide the requisite antecedent basis for the claims.  In order to correct any errors and/or provide missing or supplemental information, the initial draft application must be reviewed by the inventors. While rare at this stage, R&D may be asked to perform additional experiments, but only if absolutely necessary prior to filing.  At the end of the review/revision process, a final draft of the patent application must be approved by the inventor(s) prior to filing. Since the draft patent application needs to be approved by the inventor(s), another important piece of information that should accompany the invention disclosure is a listing of persons who materially contributed to the creation of the invention.  From the listing of contributors, MANE patent counsel will conduct an inquiry into the nature of each contributor's involvement and make a legal determination as to whose contribution rises to the level of \"inventorship.\"  It is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of some aspect of the inventive features (i.e., novel and/or non-obvious) of the invention.  Conception, which is the key to inventorship, may be defined as the formation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter put into practice.  And because inventions are defined by the claims, an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that (s)he conceived.  Additionally, those claim element(s) must be one of the inventive elements. To be co-inventors, the contributions of each person need not be equal or the same.  All that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the claims in the patent application.  Please note that being present during a meeting, providing research support, setting up experiments at the instruction of another, or sensory/analytical testing, does not by itself indicate a contribution to the conception of the invention."

        "question": "What happens after a patent application is filed?",
        "answer": "The filing of a patent application is not the end of the process, but really the beginning of a formal examination process.  Moreover, it is necessary to make decisions regarding thefiling of one or more foreign patent applications. Under the Paris Convention (an international treaty created in 1883 requiring member countries to adopt certain minimum protections for industrial property), the priority filing permits the applicant to file one or more corresponding patent application in additional countries, within 12 months from the priority filing date.  Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which is another international treaty concluded in 1970, a single filing of a PCT application may be made with a Receiving Office (RO) in one language.  A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a patent, since there is no such thing as an \"international patent.\"  Instead, a PCT application serves to establish a filing date in all contracting states, and must be followed up one or more national or regional phase applications to proceed towards grant of one or more patents. The PCT procedure essentially leads to a standard national or regional patent application, which may be granted or rejected according to applicable law, in each jurisdiction in which a patent is desired.  If a PCT application is desired, then it must be filed within 12 months from the priority filing date, i.e., the same deadline under the Paris Convention. However, the deadline for filing National Phase applications from the PCT application varies from member states, but is generally 30 months from the priority filing date.  So, in essence, the PCT serves as a mechanism to delay the decision for filing patent applications from 12 months to about 30 months, but only in the 153 member countries. In each jurisdiction, the claims of the patent application are evaluated for clarity, novelty, and inventiveness. After 18 months from the earliest priority date, the application publishes and thus the invention is available to the public."

        "question": "What is a patent?",
        "answer": "A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. A few exemplary inventions include 1) a new process for making seamless capsules, 2) a new fragrance molecule, or 3) a new composition that blocks bitterness taste of high intensity sweeteners. Patent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner’s consent. Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop patent infringement. Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party."

        "question": "What is patentable?",
        "answer": "An invention must, in general, fulfill the following conditions to be protected by a patent. 1. Industrially applicable (useful): It must be of practical use. 2. New: It must show an element of “novelty”, meaning some new characteristic that is not part of the body of existing knowledge in its particular technical field. That body of existing knowledge is called “prior art”. 3. Inventive (not obvious):  It must show an “inventive step” that is not obvious or routine by a person with average knowledge of the technical field. The subject matter of the invention must also be accepted as “patentable” under the patent laws of a given county. In many countries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods or methods of medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) are not generally patentable. For example abstract ideas (Einstein's equation E=mc2), laws of nature (gravity), or natural occurring phenomena (a chemical found in nature) are not patentable, but specific applications of these things could be patentable."

        "question": "Which countries are covered by a patent?",
        "answer": "Patents are granted by national patent offices or by regional offices that carry out examination work for a group of countries – for example, the European Patent Office (EPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). Under such regional systems, an applicant requests protection for an invention in one or more countries, and each country decides whether to offer patent protection within its borders. The WIPO-administered Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides for the filing of a single international patent application that has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries. However, in order to obtain a patent in a PCT member nation, a patent application must be filed and prosecuted in the PCT member nation."

        "answer": "Patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license. The definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction, but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention. In many countries, a use is required to be commercial (or to have a commercial purpose) to constitute patent infringement. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. In other words, the terms of the claims inform the public of what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder. Patents are territorial, and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force."

        "answer": "Preferably, the language of the laboratory notebook is English, but French or Spanish may be acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the Mane Innovation center. The information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet, dated (using two digits for the day, at least three letters to uniquely identify the month, and four digits for the year, e.g., 20 MAY 2017 or 05 NOV 2017), and referenced with its company project name or number and/or an internal reference specific to the researcher. The recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the pages of the notebook, respecting the full width of the pages. The insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided, as information may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning."

Any mistakes or crossed-out entries, as soon as they appear in the laboratory book, must be dated and signed by the author. Do not insert any information (including corrections) in a corner of a page (even if that page has not yet been countersigned by a witness). If any error or mistake is identified, the erroneous information should be clearly identified and corrected in a space immediately below the error. If there is no available space or the available space is insufficient, then corrections may be made on a subsequent page (with an appropriate forward reference on the page bearing the erroneous information). If the date on which the error was found and/or corrected is different from the origin date, said correction date should be properly recorded. Unused lines or spaces at the bottom of the pages should be crossed out using a “Z” marking In order to certify the reality of the recording, the author must have a witness sign each of the pages of his laboratory notebook within a maximum of 4 weeks after the writing of each of these pages. No new information or data integration can be entered onto any page that has been already signed by a witness."
