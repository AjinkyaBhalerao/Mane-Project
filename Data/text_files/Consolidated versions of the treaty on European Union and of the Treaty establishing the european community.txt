Article 7 (*)
1.
On a reasoned proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by the
Commission, the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the assent of
the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State
of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), and address appropriate recommendations to that State. Before
making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question and, acting in
accordance with the same procedure, may call on independent persons to submit within a reasonable
time limit a report on the situation in the Member State in question.
The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue
to apply.
2.
The Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government and acting by
unanimity on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the Commission and after obtaining
the assent of the European Parliament, may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by
a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), after inviting the government of the Member
State in question to submit its observations.
3.
Where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made, the Council, acting by a qualified
majority, may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to the
Member State in question, including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that
Member State in the Council. In doing so, the Council shall take into account the possible consequences
of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons.
The obligations of the Member State in question under this Treaty shall in any case continue to be
binding on that State.
4.
The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures
taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being imposed.
5.
For the purposes of this Article, the Council shall act without taking into account the vote of the
representative of the government of the Member State in question. Abstentions by members present in
person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of decisions referred to in paragraph 2. A qualified
majority shall be defined as the same proportion of the weighted votes of the members of the Council
concerned as laid down in Article 205(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

Article 27
In carrying out the tasks entrusted to it under this chapter the Commission shall be guided by:
(a)
the need to promote trade between Member States and third countries;
(b)
developments in conditions of competition within the Community in so far as they lead to an
improvement in the competitive capacity of undertakings;
(c)
the requirements of the Community as regards the supply of raw materials and semi-finished
goods; in this connection the Commission shall take care to avoid distorting conditions of
competition between Member States in respect of finished goods;
(d)
the need to avoid serious disturbances in the economies of Member States and to ensure rational
development of production and an expansion of consumption within the Community.

PROHIBITION OF QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS BETWEEN MEMBER STATES
Article 28
Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited
between Member States.

between Member States.
Article 30
The provisions of Articles 28 and 29 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports
or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the
protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures
possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial

Official Journal of the European Communities
C 325/47

ciples laid down in paragraph 1 or which restricts the scope of the articles dealing with the prohibition
of customs duties and quantitative restrictions between Member States.
3.
If a State monopoly of a commercial character has rules which are designed to make it easier to
dispose of agricultural products or obtain for them the best return, steps should be taken in applying the
rules contained in this article to ensure equivalent safeguards for the employment and standard of living
of the producers concerned.
TITLE II
AGRICULTURE
Article 32
1.
The common market shall extend to agriculture and trade in agricultural products. ‘Agricultural

The objectives of the common agricultural policy shall be:
(a)
to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational
development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in
particular labour;
(b)
thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing
the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture;
(c)
to stabilise markets;

to assure the availability of supplies;
(e)
to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.

C 325/48
Official Journal of the European Communities
24.12.2002
2.
In working out the common agricultural policy and the special methods for its application,
account shall be taken of:
(a)
the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture
and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions;
(b)
the need to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees;
(c)
the fact that in the Member States agriculture constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy
as a whole.
Article 34
1.
In order to attain the objectives set out in Article 33, a common organisation of agricultural
markets shall be established.
This organisation shall take one of the following forms, depending on the product concerned:
(a)
common rules on competition;
(b)
compulsory coordination of the various national market organisations;
(c)
a European market organisation.
2.
The common organisation established in accordance with paragraph 1 may include all measures
required to attain the objectives set out in Article 33, in particular regulation of prices, aids for the
production and marketing of the various products, storage and carryover arrangements and common
machinery for stabilising imports or exports.
The common organisation shall be limited to pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 33 and shall
exclude any discrimination between producers or consumers within the Community.
Any common price policy shall be based on common criteria and uniform methods of calculation.
3.
In order to enable the common organisation referred to in paragraph 1 to attain its objectives,
one or more agricultural guidance and guarantee funds may be set up.
Article 35
To enable the objectives set out in Article 33 to be attained, provision may be made within the
framework of the common agricultural policy for measures such as:
(a)
an effective coordination of efforts in the spheres of vocational training, of research and of the
dissemination of agricultural knowledge; this may include joint financing of projects or institutions;
(b)
joint measures to promote consumption of certain products.

C 325/49
Article 36
The provisions of the chapter relating to rules on competition shall apply to production of and trade in
agricultural products only to the extent determined by the Council within the framework of Article
37(2) and (3) and in accordance with the procedure laid down therein, account being taken of the
objectives set out in Article 33.
The Council may, in particular, authorise the granting of aid:
(a)
for the protection of enterprises handicapped by structural or natural conditions;
(b)
within the framework of economic development programmes.
Article 37
1.
In order to evolve the broad lines of a common agricultural policy, the Commission shall,
immediately this Treaty enters into force, convene a conference of the Member States with a view to
making a comparison of their agricultural policies, in particular by producing a statement of their
resources and needs.
2.
Having taken into account the work of the Conference provided for in paragraph 1, after
consulting the Economic and Social Committee and within two years of the entry into force of this
Treaty, the Commission shall submit proposals for working out and implementing the common agri-
cultural policy, including the replacement of the national organisations by one of the forms of common
organisation provided for in Article 34(1), and for implementing the measures specified in this title.
These proposals shall take account of the interdependence of the agricultural matters mentioned in this
title.
The Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament,
acting by a qualified majority, make regulations, issue directives, or take decisions, without prejudice to
any recommendations it may also make.
3.
The Council may, acting by a qualified majority and in accordance with paragraph 2, replace the
national market organisations by the common organisation provided for in Article 34(1) if:
(a)
the common organisation offers Member States which are opposed to this measure and which have
an organisation of their own for the production in question equivalent safeguards for the
employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, account being taken of the
adjustments that will be possible and the specialisation that will be needed with the passage of
time;
(b)
such an organisation ensures conditions for trade within the Community similar to those existing
in a national market.
4.
If a common organisation for certain raw materials is established before a common organisation
exists for the corresponding processed products, such raw materials as are used for processed products
intended for export to third countries may be imported from outside the Community.

afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part
of the products in question.
Article 82
Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or in a

(a)
directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions;
(b)
limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;

country and with the provisions of Article 81, in particular paragraph 3, and of Article 82.
Article 85
1.
Without prejudice to Article 84, the Commission shall ensure the application of the principles
laid down in Articles 81 and 82. On application by a Member State or on its own initiative, and in
cooperation with the competent authorities in the Member States, which shall give it their assistance, the
Commission shall investigate cases of suspected infringement of these principles. If it finds that there has
been an infringement, it shall propose appropriate measures to bring it to an end.
2.
If the infringement is not brought to an end, the Commission shall record such infringement of
the principles in a reasoned decision. The Commission may publish its decision and authorise Member
States to take the measures, the conditions and details of which it shall determine, needed to remedy the
situation.

Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the
character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in this Treaty, in
particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the
performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them. The development of trade must
not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community.

SECTION 2
AIDS GRANTED BY STATES
Article 87
1.
Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State
resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain
undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member
States, be incompatible with the common market.
2.
The following shall be compatible with the common market:
(a)
aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, provided that such aid is granted
without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned;
(b)
aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;
(c)
aid granted to the economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany affected by the
division of Germany, in so far as such aid is required in order to compensate for the economic
disadvantages caused by that division.
3.
The following may be considered to be compatible with the common market:
(a)
aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low
or where there is serious underemployment;
(b)
aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a
serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State;
(c)
aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas, where
such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest;
(d)
aid to promote culture and heritage conservation where such aid does not affect trading conditions
and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common interest;
(e)
such other categories of aid as may be specified by decision of the Council acting by a qualified
majority on a proposal from the Commission.
Article 88
1.
The Commission shall, in cooperation with Member States, keep under constant review all
systems of aid existing in those States. It shall propose to the latter any appropriate measures
required by the progressive development or by the functioning of the common market.
2.
If, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds
that aid granted by a State or through State resources is not compatible with the common market
having regard to Article 87, or that such aid is being misused, it shall decide that the State concerned
shall abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.
EN

C 325/67
If the State concerned does not comply with this decision within the prescribed time, the Commission or
any other interested State may, in derogation from the provisions of Articles 226 and 227, refer the
matter to the Court of Justice direct.
On application by a Member State, the Council may, acting unanimously, decide that aid which that
State is granting or intends to grant shall be considered to be compatible with the common market, in
derogation from the provisions of Article 87 or from the regulations provided for in Article 89, if such
a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances. If, as regards the aid in question, the Commission
has already initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the fact that
the State concerned has made its application to the Council shall have the effect of suspending that
procedure until the Council has made its attitude known.
If, however, the Council has not made its attitude known within three months of the said application
being made, the Commission shall give its decision on the case.
3.
The Commission shall be informed, in sufficient time to enable it to submit its comments, of any
plans to grant or alter aid. If it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the common market
having regard to Article 87, it shall without delay initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2.
The Member State concerned shall not put its proposed measures into effect until this procedure has
resulted in a final decision.
Article 89
The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the
European Parliament, may make any appropriate regulations for the application of Articles 87 and 88
and may in particular determine the conditions in which Article 88(3) shall apply and the categories of
aid exempted from this procedure.
CHAPTER 2

No Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States any
internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic
products.
Furthermore, no Member State shall impose on the products of other Member States any internal
taxation of such a nature as to afford indirect protection to other products.

In the case of charges other than turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation,
remissions and repayments in respect of exports to other Member States may not be granted and

The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the
European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, adopt provisions for the harmonisation

market within the time limit laid down in Article 14.
CHAPTER 3
APPROXIMATION OF LAWS
Article 94
The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the
European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, issue directives for the approximation of
such laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States as directly affect the estab-
lishment or functioning of the common market.
Article 95
1.
By way of derogation from Article 94 and save where otherwise provided in this Treaty, the
following provisions shall apply for the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 14. The Council
shall, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 and after consulting the
Economic and Social Committee, adopt the measures for the approximation of the provisions laid
down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their object the
establishment and functioning of the internal market.
2.
Paragraph 1 shall not apply to fiscal provisions, to those relating to the free movement of persons
nor to those relating to the rights and interests of employed persons.
3.
The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environ-
mental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection, taking account
in particular of any new development based on scientific facts. Within their respective powers, the
European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective.
4.
If, after the adoption by the Council or by the Commission of a harmonisation measure, a
Member State deems it necessary to maintain national provisions on grounds of major needs referred
to in Article 30, or relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment, it shall
notify the Commission of these provisions as well as the grounds for maintaining them.
5.
Moreover, without prejudice to paragraph 4, if, after the adoption by the Council or by the
Commission of a harmonisation measure, a Member State deems it necessary to introduce national
provisions based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the
working environment on grounds of a problem specific to that Member State arising after the
adoption of the harmonisation measure, it shall notify the Commission of the envisaged provisions
as well as the grounds for introducing them.

6.
The Commission shall, within six months of the notifications as referred to in paragraphs 4 and
5, approve or reject the national provisions involved after having verified whether or not they are a
means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States and
whether or not they shall constitute an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.
In the absence of a decision by the Commission within this period the national provisions referred to in
paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be deemed to have been approved.
When justified by the complexity of the matter and in the absence of danger for human health, the
Commission may notify the Member State concerned that the period referred to in this paragraph may
be extended for a further period of up to six months.
7.
When, pursuant to paragraph 6, a Member State is authorised to maintain or introduce national
provisions derogating from a harmonisation measure, the Commission shall immediately examine
whether to propose an adaptation to that measure.
8.
When a Member State raises a specific problem on public health in a field which has been the
subject of prior harmonisation measures, it shall bring it to the attention of the Commission which shall
immediately examine whether to propose appropriate measures to the Council.
9.
By way of derogation from the procedure laid down in Articles 226 and 227, the Commission
and any Member State may bring the matter directly before the Court of Justice if it considers that
another Member State is making improper use of the powers provided for in this Article.
10.
The harmonisation measures referred to above shall, in appropriate cases, include a safeguard
clause authorising the Member States to take, for one or more of the non-economic reasons referred to
in Article 30, provisional measures subject to a Community control procedure.
Article 96
Where the Commission finds that a difference between the provisions laid down by law, regulation or
administrative action in Member States is distorting the conditions of competition in the common
market and that the resultant distortion needs to be eliminated, it shall consult the Member States
concerned.
If such consultation does not result in an agreement eliminating the distortion in question, the Council
shall, on a proposal from the Commission, acting by a qualified majority, issue the necessary directives.
The Commission and the Council may take any other appropriate measures provided for in this Treaty.
Article 97
1.
Where there is a reason to fear that the adoption or amendment of a provision laid down by law,
regulation or administrative action may cause distortion within the meaning of Article 96, a Member
State desiring to proceed therewith shall consult the Commission. After consulting the Member States,
the Commission shall recommend to the States concerned such measures as may be appropriate to
avoid the distortion in question.

If a State desiring to introduce or amend its own provisions does not comply with the recom-
mendation addressed to it by the Commission, other Member States shall not be required, pursuant to
Article 96, to amend their own provisions in order to eliminate such distortion. If the Member State
which has ignored the recommendation of the Commission causes distortion detrimental only to itself,
the provisions of Article 96 shall not apply.
TITLE VII

CHAPTER 1
ECONOMIC POLICY
Article 98
Member States shall conduct their economic policies with a view to contributing to the achievement of
the objectives of the Community, as defined in Article 2, and in the context of the broad guidelines

Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by
natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, acting by a qualified
majority on a proposal from the Commission, may grant, under certain conditions, Community

European Parliament of the decision taken.
Article 101
1.

Article 104
1.
Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
2.
The Commission shall monitor the development of the budgetary situation and of the stock of
government debt in the Member States with a view to identifying gross errors. In particular it shall
examine compliance with budgetary discipline on the basis of the following two criteria:
(a)
whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product exceeds a
reference value, unless:
—
either the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes
close to the reference value,
—
or, alternatively, the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the
ratio remains close to the reference value;
(b)
whether the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product exceeds a reference value, unless
the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.
The reference values are specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to this
Treaty.
3.
If a Member State does not fulfil the requirements under one or both of these criteria, the
Commission shall prepare a report. The report of the Commission shall also take into account
whether the government deficit exceeds government investment expenditure and take into account all
other relevant factors, including the medium-term economic and budgetary position of the Member
State.
EN
24.12.2002
Official Journal of the European Communities
C 325/73
The Commission may also prepare a report if, notwithstanding the fulfilment of the requirements under
the criteria, it is of the opinion that there is a risk of an excessive deficit in a Member State.
4.
The Committee provided for in Article 114 shall formulate an opinion on the report of the
Commission.
5.
If the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur, the
Commission shall address an opinion to the Council.
6.
The Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission,
and having considered any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make, decide
after an overall assessment whether an excessive deficit exists.
7.
Where the existence of an excessive deficit is decided according to paragraph 6, the Council shall
make recommendations to the Member State concerned with a view to bringing that situation to an end
within a given period. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 8, these recommendations shall not be
made public.
8.
Where it establishes that there has been no effective action in response to its recommendations
within the period laid down, the Council may make its recommendations public.
9.
If a Member State persists in failing to put into practice the recommendations of the Council, the
Council may decide to give notice to the Member State to take, within a specified time limit, measures
for the deficit reduction which is judged necessary by the Council in order to remedy the situation.
In such a case, the Council may request the Member State concerned to submit reports in accordance
with a specific timetable in order to examine the adjustment efforts of that Member State.
10.
The rights to bring actions provided for in Articles 226 and 227 may not be exercised within
the framework of paragraphs 1 to 9 of this Article.
11.
As long as a Member State fails to comply with a decision taken in accordance with paragraph
9, the Council may decide to apply or, as the case may be, intensify one or more of the following
measures:
—
to require the Member State concerned to publish additional information, to be specified by the
Council, before issuing bonds and securities,
—
to invite the European Investment Bank to reconsider its lending policy towards the Member State
concerned,
—
to require the Member State concerned to make a non-interest-bearing deposit of an appropriate
size with the Community until the excessive deficit has, in the view of the Council, been corrected,
—
to impose fines of an appropriate size.
The President of the Council shall inform the European Parliament of the decisions taken.
12.
The Council shall abrogate some or all of its decisions referred to in paragraphs 6 to 9 and 11
to the extent that the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council,
been corrected. If the Council has previously made public recommendations, it shall, as soon as the
decision under paragraph 8 has been abrogated, make a public statement that an excessive deficit in the
Member State concerned no longer exists.

a recommendation from the Commission by a majority of two thirds of the votes of its members
weighted in accordance with Article 205(2), excluding the votes of the representative of the Member
State concerned.

result of the type of currency at its disposal, and where such difficulties are liable in particular to
jeopardise the functioning of the common market or the progressive implementation of the common
commercial policy, the Commission shall immediately investigate the position of the State in question

C 325/83
If the action taken by a Member State and the measures suggested by the Commission do not prove
sufficient to overcome the difficulties which have arisen or which threaten, the Commission shall, after
consulting the Committee referred to in Article 114, recommend to the Council the granting of mutual
assistance and appropriate methods therefor.
The Commission shall keep the Council regularly informed of the situation and of how it is developing.

The Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall grant such mutual assistance; it shall adopt
directives or decisions laying down the conditions and details of such assistance, which may take such
forms as:
(a)
a concerted approach to or within any other international organisations to which Member States
may have recourse;
(b)
measures needed to avoid deflection of trade where the State which is in difficulties maintains or
reintroduces quantitative restrictions against third countries;
(c)
the granting of limited credits by other Member States, subject to their agreement.
3.
If the mutual assistance recommended by the Commission is not granted by the Council or if the
mutual assistance granted and the measures taken are insufficient, the Commission shall authorise the
State which is in difficulties to take protective measures, the conditions and details of which the
Commission shall determine.
Such authorisation may be revoked and such conditions and details may be changed by the Council
acting by a qualified majority.

Article 119(2) is not immediately taken, the Member State concerned may, as a precaution, take the
necessary protective measures. Such measures must cause the least possible disturbance in the func-
tioning of the common market and must not be wider in scope than is strictly necessary to remedy the
sudden difficulties which have arisen.
2.
The Commission and the other Member States shall be informed of such protective measures not
later than when they enter into force. The Commission may recommend to the Council the granting of
mutual assistance under Article 119.

Article 121
1.
The Commission and the EMI shall report to the Council on the progress made in the fulfilment
by the Member States of their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union.
These reports shall include an examination of the compatibility between each Member State's national
legislation, including the statutes of its national central bank, and Articles 108 and 109 of this Treaty
and the Statute of the ESCB. The reports shall also examine the achievement of a high degree of
sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of the following criteria:
—
the achievement of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation
which is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price
stability,
—
the sustainability of the government financial position; this will be apparent from having achieved a
government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance with
Article 104(6),
—
the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System, for at least two years, without devaluing against the currency of
any other Member State,
—
the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State and of its participation in the
exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System being reflected in the long-term
interest-rate levels.
The four criteria mentioned in this paragraph and the relevant periods over which they are to be
respected are developed further in a Protocol annexed to this Treaty. The reports of the Commission
and the EMI shall also take account of the development of the ecu, the results of the integration of
markets, the situation and development of the balances of payments on current account and an
examination of the development of unit labour costs and other price indices.
2.
On the basis of these reports, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation
from the Commission, shall assess:
—
for each Member State, whether it fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single
currency;
—
whether a majority of the Member States fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a
single currency,
and recommend its findings to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or
Government. The European Parliament shall be consulted and forward its opinion to the Council, meeting
in the composition of the Heads of State or Government.
3.
Taking due account of the reports referred to in paragraph 1 and the opinion of the European
Parliament referred to in paragraph 2, the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or
Government, shall, acting by a qualified majority, not later than 31 December 1996:
—
decide, on the basis of the recommendations of the Council referred to in paragraph 2, whether a
majority of the Member States fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency,
EN
24.12.2002
Official Journal of the European Communities
C 325/85
—
decide whether it is appropriate for the Community to enter the third stage,
and if so:
—
set the date for the beginning of the third stage.
4.
If, by the end of 1997, the date for the beginning of the third stage has not been set, the third
stage shall start on 1 January 1999. Before 1 July 1998, the Council, meeting in the composition of the
Heads of State or Government, after a repetition of the procedure provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2,
with the exception of the second indent of paragraph 2, taking into account the reports referred to in
paragraph 1 and the opinion of the European Parliament, shall, acting by a qualified majority and on the
basis of the recommendations of the Council referred to in paragraph 2, confirm which Member States
fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.
Article 122
1.
If the decision has been taken to set the date in accordance with Article 121(3), the Council shall,
on the basis of its recommendations referred to in Article 121(2), acting by a qualified majority on a
recommendation from the Commission, decide whether any, and if so which, Member States shall have
a derogation as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article. Such Member States shall in this Treaty be
referred to as ‘Member States with a derogation’.
If the Council has confirmed which Member States fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a
single currency, in accordance with Article 121(4), those Member States which do not fulfil the
conditions shall have a derogation as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article. Such Member States
shall in this Treaty be referred to as ‘Member States with a derogation’.
2.
At least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the
Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Article 121(1). After consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the Council, meeting in
the composition of the Heads of State or Government, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority
on a proposal from the Commission, decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary
conditions on the basis of the criteria set out in Article 121(1), and abrogate the derogations of the
Member States concerned.
3.
A derogation referred to in paragraph 1 shall entail that the following articles do not apply to the
Member State concerned: Articles 104(9) and (11), 105(1), (2), (3) and (5), 106, 110, 111, and
112(2)(b). The exclusion of such a Member State and its national central bank from rights and obli-
gations within the ESCB is laid down in Chapter IX of the Statute of the ESCB.
4.
In Articles 105(1), (2) and (3), 106, 110, 111 and 112(2)(b), ‘Member States’ shall be read as
‘Member States without a derogation’.

decisions referred to in the articles of this Treaty mentioned in paragraph 3. In that case, by way of
derogation from Articles 205 and 250(1), a qualified majority shall be defined as two thirds of the votes
of the representatives of the Member States without a derogation weighted in accordance with Article
205(2), and unanimity of those Member States shall be required for an act requiring unanimity.
6.
Articles 119 and 120 shall continue to apply to a Member State with a derogation.
Article 123 (*)

Immediately after the decision on the date for the beginning of the third stage has been taken in
accordance with Article 121(3), or, as the case may be, immediately after 1 July 1998:
—
the Council shall adopt the provisions referred to in Article 107(6),
—
the governments of the Member States without a derogation shall appoint, in accordance with the
procedure set out in Article 50 of the Statute of the ESCB, the President, the Vice-President and the
other members of the Executive Board of the ECB. If there are Member States with a derogation,
the number of members of the Executive Board may be smaller than provided for in Article 11.1 of
the Statute of the ESCB, but in no circumstances shall it be less than four.
As soon as the Executive Board is appointed, the ESCB and the ECB shall be established and shall
prepare for their full operation as described in this Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. The full exercise
of their powers shall start from the first day of the third stage.
2.
As soon as the ECB is established, it shall, if necessary, take over tasks of the EMI. The EMI shall
go into liquidation upon the establishment of the ECB; the modalities of liquidation are laid down in the
Statute of the EMI.
3.
If and as long as there are Member States with a derogation, and without prejudice to Article
107(3) of this Treaty, the General Council of the ECB referred to in Article 45 of the Statute of the ESCB
shall be constituted as a third decision-making body of the ECB.
4.
At the starting date of the third stage, the Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member
States without a derogation, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB, adopt
the conversion rates at which their currencies shall be irrevocably fixed and at which irrevocably fixed
rate the ecu shall be substituted for these currencies, and the ecu will become a currency in its own
right. This measure shall by itself not modify the external value of the ecu. The Council, acting by a
qualified majority of the said Member States, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting
the ECB, shall take the other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the ecu as the single
currency of those Member States. The second sentence of Article 122(5) shall apply.

Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member States without a derogation and the Member
State concerned, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB, adopt the rate at
which the ecu shall be substituted for the currency of the Member State concerned, and take the other
measures necessary for the introduction of the ecu as the single currency in the Member State
concerned.
Article 124
1.
Until the beginning of the third stage, each Member State shall treat its exchange-rate policy as a
matter of common interest. In so doing, Member States shall take account of the experience acquired in
cooperation within the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) and in developing the ecu,
and shall respect existing powers in this field.

From the beginning of the third stage and for as long as a Member State has a derogation,
paragraph 1 shall apply by analogy to the exchange-rate policy of that Member State.

On a proposal from the Commission, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority, issue any
directives needed for this purpose.
2.
The preceding provisions shall not apply to such a drawback of customs duties or charges having
equivalent effect nor to such a repayment of indirect taxation including turnover taxes, excise duties and
other indirect taxes as is allowed when goods are exported from a Member State to a third country, in

The Commission shall conduct these negotiations in consultation with a special committee appointed by
the Council to assist the Commission in this task and within the framework of such directives as the
Council may issue to it. The Commission shall report regularly to the special committee on the progress
of negotiations.
The relevant provisions of Article 300 shall apply.
4.
In exercising the powers conferred upon it by this Article, the Council shall act by a qualified
majority.
5.
Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall also apply to the negotiation and conclusion of agreements in the fields
of trade in services and the commercial aspects of intellectual property, in so far as those agreements are
not covered by the said paragraphs and without prejudice to paragraph 6.
By way of derogation from paragraph 4, the Council shall act unanimously when negotiating and
concluding an agreement in one of the fields referred to in the first subparagraph, where that
agreement includes provisions for which unanimity is required for the adoption of internal rules or
where it relates to a field in which the Community has not yet exercised the powers conferred upon it
by this Treaty by adopting internal rules.
The Council shall act unanimously with respect to the negotiation and conclusion of a horizontal
agreement insofar as it also concerns the preceding subparagraph or the second subparagraph of
paragraph 6.
This paragraph shall not affect the right of the Member States to maintain and conclude agreements
with third countries or international organisations in so far as such agreements comply with Community
law and other relevant international agreements.
6.
An agreement may not be concluded by the Council if it includes provisions which would go
beyond the Community's internal powers, in particular by leading to harmonisation of the laws or
regulations of the Member States in an area for which this Treaty rules out such harmonisation.
In this regard, by way of derogation from the first subparagraph of paragraph 5, agreements relating to
trade in cultural and audiovisual services, educational services, and social and human health services,
shall fall within the shared competence of the Community and its Member States. Consequently, in
addition to a Community decision taken in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 300, the
negotiation of such agreements shall require the common accord of the Member States. Agreements
thus negotiated shall be concluded jointly by the Community and the Member States.
The negotiation and conclusion of international agreements in the field of transport shall continue to be
governed by the provisions of Title V and Article 300.
7.
Without prejudice to the first subparagraph of paragraph 6, the Council, acting unanimously on a
proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may extend the
application of paragraphs 1 to 4 to international negotiations and agreements on intellectual
property in so far as they are not covered by paragraph 5.

Article 271
The expenditure shown in the budget shall be authorised for one financial year, unless the regulations
made pursuant to Article 279 provide otherwise.
In accordance with conditions to be laid down pursuant to Article 279, any appropriations, other than
those relating to staff expenditure, that are unexpended at the end of the financial year may be carried
forward to the next financial year only.
Appropriations shall be classified under different chapters grouping items of expenditure according to
their nature or purpose and subdivided, as far as may be necessary, in accordance with the regulations
made pursuant to Article 279.
The expenditure of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice shall
be set out in separate parts of the budget, without prejudice to special arrangements for certain common
items of expenditure.
Article 272
1.
The financial year shall run from 1 January to 31 December.
2.
Each institution of the Community shall, before 1 July, draw up estimates of its expenditure. The
Commission shall consolidate these estimates in a preliminary draft budget. It shall attach thereto an
opinion which may contain different estimates.
The preliminary draft budget shall contain an estimate of revenue and an estimate of expenditure.
3.
The Commission shall place the preliminary draft budget before the Council not later than
1 September of the year preceding that in which the budget is to be implemented.
The Council shall consult the Commission and, where appropriate, the other institutions concerned
whenever it intends to depart from the preliminary draft budget.

year preceding that in which the budget is to be implemented.
The European Parliament shall have the right to amend the draft budget, acting by a majority of its
Members, and to propose to the Council, acting by an absolute majority of the votes cast, modifications
to the draft budget relating to expenditure necessarily resulting from this Treaty or from acts adopted in
accordance therewith.
If, within 45 days of the draft budget being placed before it, the European Parliament has given its
approval, the budget shall stand as finally adopted. If within this period the European Parliament has not
amended the draft budget nor proposed any modifications thereto, the budget shall be deemed to be
finally adopted.

Official Journal of the European Communities
C 325/141
If within this period the European Parliament has adopted amendments or proposed modifications, the
draft budget together with the amendments or proposed modifications shall be forwarded to the
Council.
5.
After discussing the draft budget with the Commission and, where appropriate, with the other
institutions concerned, the Council shall act under the following conditions:
(a)
the Council may, acting by a qualified majority, modify any of the amendments adopted by the
European Parliament;
(b)
with regard to the proposed modifications:
—
where a modification proposed by the European Parliament does not have the effect of
increasing the total amount of the expenditure of an institution, owing in particular to the
fact that the increase in expenditure which it would involve would be expressly compensated
by one or more proposed modifications correspondingly reducing expenditure, the Council
may, acting by a qualified majority, reject the proposed modification. In the absence of a
decision to reject it, the proposed modification shall stand as accepted,
—
where a modification proposed by the European Parliament has the effect of increasing the
total amount of the expenditure of an institution, the Council may, acting by a qualified
majority, accept this proposed modification. In the absence of a decision to accept it, the
proposed modification shall stand as rejected,
—
where, pursuant to one of the two preceding subparagraphs, the Council has rejected a
proposed modification, it may, acting by a qualified majority, either retain the amount
shown in the draft budget or fix another amount.
The draft budget shall be modified on the basis of the proposed modifications accepted by the Council.
If, within 15 days of the draft being placed before it, the Council has not modified any of the
amendments adopted by the European Parliament and if the modifications proposed by the latter
have been accepted, the budget shall be deemed to be finally adopted. The Council shall inform the
European Parliament that it has not modified any of the amendments and that the proposed modifi-
cations have been accepted.
If within this period the Council has modified one or more of the amendments adopted by the European
Parliament or if the modifications proposed by the latter have been rejected or modified, the modified
draft budget shall again be forwarded to the European Parliament. The Council shall inform the
European Parliament of the results of its deliberations.
6.
Within 15 days of the draft budget being placed before it, the European Parliament, which shall
have been notified of the action taken on its proposed modifications, may, acting by a majority of its
Members and three fifths of the votes cast, amend or reject the modifications to its amendments made
by the Council and shall adopt the budget accordingly. If within this period the European Parliament has
not acted, the budget shall be deemed to be finally adopted.
7.
When the procedure provided for in this Article has been completed, the President of the
European Parliament shall declare that the budget has been finally adopted.

8.
However, the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its Members and two thirds of the
votes cast, may, if there are important reasons, reject the draft budget and ask for a new draft to be
submitted to it.
9.
A maximum rate of increase in relation to the expenditure of the same type to be incurred during
the current year shall be fixed annually for the total expenditure other than that necessarily resulting
from this Treaty or from acts adopted in accordance therewith.
The Commission shall, after consulting the Economic Policy Committee, declare what this maximum
rate is as it results from:
—
the trend, in terms of volume, of the gross national product within the Community,
—
the average variation in the budgets of the Member States,
and
—
the trend of the cost of living during the preceding financial year.
The maximum rate shall be communicated, before 1 May, to all the institutions of the Community. The
latter shall be required to conform to this during the budgetary procedure, subject to the provisions of
the fourth and fifth subparagraphs of this paragraph.
If, in respect of expenditure other than that necessarily resulting from this Treaty or from acts adopted
in accordance therewith, the actual rate of increase in the draft budget established by the Council is over
half the maximum rate, the European Parliament may, exercising its right of amendment, further
increase the total amount of that expenditure to a limit not exceeding half the maximum rate.
Where the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission consider that the activities of the
Communities require that the rate determined according to the procedure laid down in this
paragraph should be exceeded, another rate may be fixed by agreement between the Council, acting
by a qualified majority, and the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its Members and three
fifths of the votes cast.
10.
Each institution shall exercise the powers conferred upon it by this article, with due regard for
the provisions of the Treaty and for acts adopted in accordance therewith, in particular those relating to
the Communities' own resources and to the balance between revenue and expenditure.
Article 273
If, at the beginning of a financial year, the budget has not yet been voted, a sum equivalent to not more
than one twelfth of the budget appropriations for the preceding financial year may be spent each month
in respect of any chapter or other subdivision of the budget in accordance with the provisions of the
Regulations made pursuant to Article 279; this arrangement shall not, however, have the effect of
placing at the disposal of the Commission appropriations in excess of one twelfth of those provided
for in the draft budget in course of preparation.
The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, provided that the other conditions laid down in the
first subparagraph are observed, authorise expenditure in excess of one twelfth.

adopted in accordance therewith, the Council shall forward it immediately to the European Parliament;
within 30 days the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its Members and three fifths of the
votes cast, may adopt a different decision on the expenditure in excess of the one twelfth referred to in
the first subparagraph. This part of the decision of the Council shall be suspended until the European
Parliament has taken its decision. If within the said period the European Parliament has not taken a
decision which differs from the decision of the Council, the latter shall be deemed to be finally adopted.
The decisions referred to in the second and third subparagraphs shall lay down the necessary measures
relating to resources to ensure application of this Article.
Article 274
The Commission shall implement the budget, in accordance with the provisions of the regulations made
pursuant to Article 279, on its own responsibility and within the limits of the appropriations, having
regard to the principles of sound financial management. Member States shall cooperate with the
Commission to ensure that the appropriations are used in accordance with the principles of sound
financial management.
The regulations shall lay down detailed rules for each institution concerning its part in effecting its own
expenditure.
Within the budget, the Commission may, subject to the limits and conditions laid down in the regu-
lations made pursuant to Article 279, transfer appropriations from one chapter to another or from one
subdivision to another.
Article 275
The Commission shall submit annually to the Council and to the European Parliament the accounts of
the preceding financial year relating to the implementation of the budget. The Commission shall also
forward to them a financial statement of the assets and liabilities of the Community.
Article 276
1.
The European Parliament, acting on a recommendation from the Council which shall act by a
qualified majority, shall give a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the
budget. To this end, the Council and the European Parliament in turn shall examine the accounts and
the financial statement referred to in Article 275, the annual report by the Court of Auditors together
with the replies of the institutions under audit to the observations of the Court of Auditors, the
statement of assurance referred to in Article 248(1), second subparagraph and any relevant special
reports by the Court of Auditors.

Before giving a discharge to the Commission, or for any other purpose in connection with the
exercise of its powers over the implementation of the budget, the European Parliament may ask to hear
the Commission give evidence with regard to the execution of expenditure or the operation of financial
control systems. The Commission shall submit any necessary information to the European Parliament at
the latter's request.

The Commission may, provided it notifies the competent authorities of the Member States concerned,
transfer into the currency of one of the Member States its holdings in the currency of another Member
State, to the extent necessary to enable them to be used for purposes which come within the scope of
this Treaty. The Commission shall as far as possible avoid making such transfers if it possesses cash or
liquid assets in the currencies which it needs.

C 325/148
Official Journal of the European Communities
24.12.2002
(a)
no Member State shall be obliged to supply information the disclosure of which it considers
contrary to the essential interests of its security;
(b)
any Member State may take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the
essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms,
munitions and war material; such measures shall not adversely affect the conditions of competition
in the common market regarding products which are not intended for specifically military
purposes.
2.
The Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, make changes to the
list, which it drew up on 15 April 1958, of the products to which the provisions of paragraph 1(b)
apply.
Article 297
Member States shall consult each other with a view to taking together the steps needed to prevent the
functioning of the common market being affected by measures which a Member State may be called
upon to take in the event of serious internal disturbances affecting the maintenance of law and order, in
the event of war, serious international tension constituting a threat of war, or in order to carry out
obligations it has accepted for the purpose of maintaining peace and international security.
Article 298
If measures taken in the circumstances referred to in Articles 296 and 297 have the effect of distorting
the conditions of competition in the common market, the Commission shall, together with the State
concerned, examine how these measures can be adjusted to the rules laid down in the Treaty.
By way of derogation from the procedure laid down in Articles 226 and 227, the Commission or any
Member State may bring the matter directly before the Court of Justice if it considers that another
Member State is making improper use of the powers provided for in Articles 296 and 297. The Court of

Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
2.
The provisions of this Treaty shall apply to the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira
and the Canary Islands.
However, taking account of the structural social and economic situation of the French overseas
departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, which is compounded by their remoteness,
insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the
permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development, the Council, acting by a
qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament,
shall adopt specific measures aimed, in particular, at laying down the conditions of application of the
present Treaty to those regions, including common policies.

The Council shall, when adopting the relevant measures referred to in the second subparagraph, take
into account areas such as customs and trade policies, fiscal policy, free zones, agriculture and fisheries
policies, conditions for supply of raw materials and essential consumer goods, State aids and conditions
of access to structural funds and to horizontal Community programmes.
The Council shall adopt the measures referred to in the second subparagraph taking into account the
special characteristics and constraints of the outermost regions without undermining the integrity and
the coherence of the Community legal order, including the internal market and common policies.
3.
The special arrangements for association set out in part four of this Treaty shall apply to the

Where this Treaty provides for the conclusion of agreements between the Community and one or
more States or international organisations, the Commission shall make recommendations to the Council,
which shall authorise the Commission to open the necessary negotiations. The Commission shall
conduct these negotiations in consultation with special committees appointed by the Council to assist
it in this task and within the framework of such directives as the Council may issue to it.
In exercising the powers conferred upon it by this paragraph, the Council shall act by a qualified
majority, except in the cases where the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 provides that the Council

Subject to the powers vested in the Commission in this field, the signing, which may be accom-
panied by a decision on provisional application before entry into force, and the conclusion of the
agreements shall be decided on by the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from
the Commission. The Council shall act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which
unanimity is required for the adoption of internal rules and for the agreements referred to in Article
310.
By way of derogation from the rules laid down in paragraph 3, the same procedures shall apply for a
decision to suspend the application of an agreement, and for the purpose of establishing the positions to
be adopted on behalf of the Community in a body set up by an agreement, when that body is called
upon to adopt decisions having legal effects, with the exception of decisions supplementing or amending
the institutional framework of the agreement.
The European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed of any decision under this paragraph
concerning the provisional application or the suspension of agreements, or the establishment of the
Community position in a body set up by an agreement.
3.
The Council shall conclude agreements after consulting the European Parliament, except for the
agreements referred to in Article 133(3), including cases where the agreement covers a field for which
the procedure referred to in Article 251 or that referred to in Article 252 is required for the adoption of
internal rules. The European Parliament shall deliver its opinion within a time limit which the Council
may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. In the absence of an opinion within that time
limit, the Council may act.
By way of derogation from the previous subparagraph, agreements referred to in Article 310, other
agreements establishing a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures,
agreements having important budgetary implications for the Community and agreements entailing
amendment of an act adopted under the procedure referred to in Article 251 shall be concluded
after the assent of the European Parliament has been obtained.
The Council and the European Parliament may, in an urgent situation, agree upon a time limit for the
assent.
4.
When concluding an agreement, the Council may, by way of derogation from paragraph 2,
authorise the Commission to approve modifications on behalf of the Community where the
agreement provides for them to be adopted by a simplified procedure or by a body set up by the
agreement; it may attach specific conditions to such authorisation.
5.
When the Council envisages concluding an agreement which calls for amendments to this Treaty,
the amendments must first be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 48 of the
Treaty on European Union.
6.
The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission or a Member State may obtain the
opinion of the Court of Justice as to whether an agreement envisaged is compatible with the provisions
of this Treaty. Where the opinion of the Court of Justice is adverse, the agreement may enter into force
only in accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union.
7.
Agreements concluded under the conditions set out in this Article shall be binding on the
institutions of the Community and on Member States.

countries, the Council shall take the necessary urgent measures. The Council shall act by a qualified
majority on a proposal from the Commission.
Article 302
It shall be for the Commission to ensure the maintenance of all appropriate relations with the organs of
the United Nations and of its specialised agencies.
The Commission shall also maintain such relations as are appropriate with all international organi-

Article 305
1.
The provisions of this Treaty shall not affect the provisions of the Treaty establishing the
European Coal and Steel Community, in particular as regards the rights and obligations of Member
States, the powers of the institutions of that Community and the rules laid down by that Treaty for the

2.
The provisions of this Treaty shall not derogate from those of the Treaty establishing the
European Atomic Energy Community.
Article 306
The provisions of this Treaty shall not preclude the existence or completion of regional unions between
Belgium and Luxembourg, or between Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, to the extent that the
objectives of these regional unions are not attained by application of this Treaty.
Article 307
The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for acceding
States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one
or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of this Treaty.
To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with this Treaty, the Member State or States
concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established. Member States
shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common
attitude.
EN
C 325/152

In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into account the
fact that the advantages accorded under this Treaty by each Member State form an integral part of the
establishment of the Community and are thereby inseparably linked with the creation of common
institutions, the conferring of powers upon them and the granting of the same advantages by all the
other Member States.
Article 308
If action by the Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the
common market, one of the objectives of the Community, and this Treaty has not provided the
necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and
after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures.
Article 309 (*)
1.
Where a decision has been taken to suspend the voting rights of the representative of the
government of a Member State in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Treaty on European Union,
these voting rights shall also be suspended with regard to this Treaty.
2.
Moreover, where the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of principles
mentioned in Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union has been determined in accordance with
Article 7(2) of that Treaty, the Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide to suspend certain of
the rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to the Member State in question. In doing so, the
Council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and
obligations of natural and legal persons.
The obligations of the Member State in question under this Treaty shall in any case continue to be
binding on that State.
3.
The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures
taken in accordance with paragraph 2 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being
imposed.
4.
When taking decisions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Council shall act without taking
into account the votes of the representative of the government of the Member State in question. By way
of derogation from Article 205(2) a qualified majority shall be defined as the same proportion of the
weighted votes of the members of the Council concerned as laid down in Article 205(2).
This paragraph shall also apply in the event of voting rights being suspended in accordance with
paragraph 1. In such cases, a decision requiring unanimity shall be taken without the vote of the
representative of the government of the Member State in question.
Article 310
The Community may conclude with one or more States or international organisations agreements
establishing an association involving reciprocal rights and obligations, common action and special
procedure.

3.
If the total number of members referred to in paragraph 2 is less than 732, a pro rata correction
shall be applied to the number of representatives to be elected in each Member State, so that the total
number is as close as possible to 732, without such a correction leading to the number of represen-
tatives to be elected in each Member State being higher than that provided for in Article 190(2) of the
Treaty establishing the European Community and in Article 108(2) of the Treaty establishing the
European Atomic Energy Community for the 1999 to 2004 term.
The Council shall adopt a decision to that effect.

majority, a member of the Council may request verification that the Member States constituting

accession of the 27th Member State of the Union takes up its duties.
3.
The Council, acting unanimously after signing the treaty of accession of the 27th Member State
of the Union, shall adopt:
—
the number of Members of the Commission,
—
the implementing arrangements for a rotation system based on the principle of equality containing
all the criteria and rules necessary for determining the composition of successive colleges auto-
matically on the basis of the following principles:
(a)
Member States shall be treated on a strictly equal footing as regards determination of the
sequence of, and the time spent by, their nationals as Members of the Commission;
consequently, the difference between the total number of terms of office held by nationals
of any given pair of Member States may never be more than one;
(b)
subject to point (a), each successive college shall be so composed as to reflect satisfactorily the
demographic and geographical range of all the Member States of the Union.
4.
Any State which accedes to the Union shall be entitled, at the time of its accession, to have one
of its nationals as a Member of the Commission until paragraph 2 applies.

order to assist the Court of First Instance in the performance of its task.
The criteria for selecting such cases, as well as the procedures for designating the Advocates-General,

sought, the same issue of interpretation is raised or the validity of the same act is called in question, the
Court of First Instance may, after hearing the parties, stay the proceedings before it until such time as
the Court of Justice shall have delivered judgment. Where applications are made for the same act to be
declared void, the Court of First Instance may also decline jurisdiction in order that the Court of Justice

of the Court of First Instance declaring a regulation to be void shall take effect only as from the date of
expiry of the period referred to in the first paragraph of Article 56 of this Statute or, if an appeal shall
have been brought within that period, as from the date of dismissal of the appeal, without prejudice,
however, to the right of a party to apply to the Court of Justice, pursuant to Articles 242 and 243 of the
EC Treaty or Articles 157 and 158 of the EAEC Treaty, for the suspension of the effects of the
regulation which has been declared void or for the prescription of any other interim measure.

case back to the Court of First Instance for judgment.
Where a case is referred back to the Court of First Instance, that Court shall be bound by the decision of
the Court of Justice on points of law.
When an appeal brought by a Member State or an institution of the Communities, which did not
intervene in the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, is well founded, the Court of Justice may,
if it considers this necessary, state which of the effects of the decision of the Court of First Instance
which has been quashed shall be considered as definitive in respect of the parties to the litigation.
Article 62
In the cases provided for in Article 225(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty and Article 140a(2) and (3) of the
EAEC Treaty, where the First Advocate-General considers that there is a serious risk of the unity or
consistency of Community law being affected, he may propose that the Court of Justice review the
decision of the Court of First Instance.
The proposal must be made within one month of delivery of the decision by the Court of First Instance.
Within one month of receiving the proposal made by the First Advocate-General, the Court of Justice
shall decide whether or not the decision should be reviewed.
