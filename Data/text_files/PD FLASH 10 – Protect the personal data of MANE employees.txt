PD FLASH – Protect the personal data of MANE employees



May 12 2020

Protecting the personal data of MANE employees during and after their employment at MANE is also a means of strengthening the bond of trust necessary for the proper functioning of the MANE Group.
A vast amount of an employee’s personal data is necessary for the management of their career and our services within MANE and we must all help to protect it.
For this some advice:
- Ask employees only for necessary information for business purposes, and avoid processing so-called "sensitive" data (health, union activity, political opinions, religion, ethnic origin). If you must process it, special obligations apply and are addressed by policy.
- Ensure confidentiality and security. Thus, only authorized persons should have access. Actions on data carried out by authorized persons must be recorded (know who connects to what, when and to do what). Logical but also physical measures must be taken to ensure its conservation and confidentiality.
- Inform the employees concerned each time you process their personal data (example: update of administrative data, training request, evaluation interview form, etc.).

Finally, always remember that employees can request a copy of all their personal data that you hold (for example: copy of a pay slip, statement of a time-savings account, telephone records, card reader statements or messages sent via professional email), and that this request can also be made by ex-employees.
In case of doubt about the legitimacy, declaration, retention or securing of the processing of personal data of an employee by your MANE department or subsidiary, contact the DPO Mane at dpo@mane.com
