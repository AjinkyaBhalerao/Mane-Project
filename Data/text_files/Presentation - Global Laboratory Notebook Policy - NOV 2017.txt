IMPORTANCE OF LABORATORY NOTEBOOKS
The primary purpose of a laboratory notebook is to preserve and protect intellectual property rights in 
all new and improved products, processes, or equipment by serving as a record and archive for all 
research and development work (ideas, experiments, formulations, etc.). 
A properly executed laboratory notebook may be used as legal evidence with respect to various 
aspects of the new or improved methods/products, such as conception and/or reduction to practice 
of an invention and date(s) corresponding thereto, test results, and the like.
•
A chronological record and the primary document of a person’s work in a research laboratory.
•
A complete record of procedures, reagents, data, and scientific interpretations and hypotheses to 
pass on to other researchers.
•
A document that records factual details of experiments, including thought experiments, ideas, 
inventions, etc.

IMPORTANCE OF LABORATORY NOTEBOOKS
It is Critical and Required! 
•
Recording what you did, so you or others can repeat the experiments. 
•
Good records make it easier to publish or share results. 
•
Troubleshooting: help find mistakes, bad materials, etc. 
•
Legal document for evidence in patent and trade secret matters. 
•
Defense against accusations of fraud or lawsuits 
Your data should be able to be explained, defended, reconstructed, or repeated without your 
assistance.

US CASE LAW
Since 2012, over 30 federal cases have been decided where laboratory notebooks were 
amongst the evidence considered by the court and referenced in the court’s opinion.
Used as evidence to show:
•
Conception date of an invention
•
Reduction to practice date of an embodiment of an invention
•
Date of first observation or discovery of a new polymorph
•
Date that a research idea was shared with a colleague (who later tried to patent himself)
Notable excerpts:
•
“an unwitnessed entry in an inventor's laboratory notebook was insufficient, without more, to 
corroborate the inventor's testimony that he had conceived of the invention.” 
•
“… whiteboard photos are analogous to the unwitnessed pages of a laboratory notebook 
and would therefore likely be insufficient on their own to corroborate inventor’s testimony of 
prior conception.”
•
“…had not signed his laboratory notebook for nine months, then curiously signed his 
notebook…”

NOTEBOOK AND METHODS 
2.1. General Rules Regarding Form
 Preferably, the language of the laboratory notebook is English, but French or Spanish may be 
acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the Mane Innovation center.
 The information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet, dated (using two digits for the 
day, at least three letters to uniquely identify the month, and four digits for the year, e.g., 20 
MAY 2017 or 05 NOV 2017), and referenced with its company project name or number 
and/or an internal reference specific to the researcher.
 The recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the 
pages of the notebook, respecting the full width of the pages.
 The insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided, as information may be 
difficult to capture accurately during scanning.
Note 3: If the need for a later entry or amendment arises, it is advisable to use unmarked section of the page 
immediately below, and particularly point out the passage(s) concerned. Where no such unmarked 
section is available, one should make the entry/amendment on a subsequent page, and record the 
subsequent page number on the instant page. An arrow, asterisk, etc. can be used to precisely 
identify the section being amended or corrected.

GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY

NOTEBOOK AND METHODS 
 Recording data can also be carried out by means of inserting preprinted information in the 
notebook (for example, typed reports, diagrams, diagrams, output datum of equipment of 
analysis, photographs, etc.). The preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of 
the page, nor cover any information already entered on the page. Transparent tape or 
other adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface.
 For two successive inserts, the second must be affixed below the other (or on two successive 
pages) and not side by side. Each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both 
the writer and the witness (each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between 
the insert and the support page). Other than the aforementioned dates and signatures, no 
other handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted.
Note 4: If there is a need to annotate information on an insert (e.g., for reasons of clarity), the "original" 
preprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied; the corresponding photocopy is then 
adhered to the surface of the notebook page.
Note 5: It is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook. For example, if the 
data set is too large, the writer can also create alternative archives for the data (e.g., an electronic 
database of HPLC chromatographs), and simply reference the corresponding file number.
Note 6: Rather than the original of an experimental material, a photograph or a digitized reproduction may 
be used, such as in the case of a thin-layer chromatography plate, a gel, a membrane, an 
autoradiography, or a thermosensitive ticket.

NOTEBOOK AND METHODS 
 Significant blank spaces between two information entries (for example, successions of blank 
lines, page breaks, pages left blank) or to the right of an insert, must be crossed out by 
means of a "Z", so that no information may be subsequently added. The removal of any 
laboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited, as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of 
the entire notebook.
 All handwritten entries shall be made using permanent ink. There is no restriction on the 
choice of ink colors to be used, provided that the recorded information remains fully legible 
and comprehensible in full, after black and white reproduction using a standard 
photocopier.
 Black or dark blue inks are recommended. The use of erasable ink, pencil, or "white 
correction fluid" is not allowed. The texts and entries must be legible (any erasure must be 
referred to and dated, both by the editor and the witness).
 Any coding of information using specific colors should be avoided. If the use of colors 
cannot be avoided, the selection of colors and/or textures must be made with careful 
consideration of a possible need for subsequent reproduction using a standard photocopier 
in black and white.
 On each page containing an entry, the name of the project and laboratory notebook 
number must be entered in the designated location at the top of the page.

NOTEBOOK AND METHODS 
2.2. General Rules Regarding Substance
Each test, experiment, or analysis, whether positive or negative, must be recorded in the 
laboratory record. Care should be taken to ensure that the following elements are clearly and
precisely stated:
 The context in which the work was carried out, the objectives set and/or the problem to be 
solved, the working hypotheses, etc.;
 The experimental conditions used (protocols, particular parameters and material used ...); 
and
 The results obtained, their possible interpretation, as well as any ideas, reflections or 
comments relating thereto.
Abbreviations may be used. However, abbreviations that are non-standard to persons having 
ordinary skill in the relevant field must be defined at their first appearance. Further, 
abbreviations, along with their definition, should also be recorded after the table of 
contents/index section at the front of the laboratory notebook.

NOTEBOOK AND METHODS 
Note 7: If a protocol has already been previously described, in the same or different laboratory 
notebook, it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry. Rather, it is 
sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity, i.e., the laboratory 
notebook number and page(s) concerned along with the name of its author. All modifications, 
changes, or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described. 
Referencing scientific publications or books is permissible if identified unambiguously using a full 
bibliographical citation.
Note 8: It is possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording 
standard laboratory or testing procedures and protocols, abbreviations, etc., and then make 
an appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook.

Duties of the author:
 Each page must be dated.
 Each page of the laboratory book, as soon as it is completed, must be dated and signed by 
the author, in the space designated for this purpose.
 Any mistakes or crossed-out entries, as soon as they appear in the laboratory book, must be 
dated and signed by the author.
 Do not insert any information (including corrections) in a corner of a page (even if that page 
has not yet been countersigned by a witness).
 If any error or mistake is identified, the erroneous information should be clearly identified and 
corrected in a space immediately below the error. If there is no available space or the 
available space is insufficient, then corrections may be made on a subsequent page (with 
an appropriate forward reference on the page bearing the erroneous information). If the 
date on which the error was found and/or corrected is different from the origin date, said 
correction date should be properly recorded.
 Unused lines or space at the bottom of the page should be crossed out using a "Z" marking.
 In order to certify the reality of the recording, the author must have a witness sign each of 
the pages of his laboratory notebook within a maximum of 4 weeks after the writing of each 
of these pages.
 No new information or data integration can be entered onto any page that has been 
already signed by a witness.

Duties of the witness:
 Read the information entered by the author/researcher to evaluate whether the level of 
detail is sufficient to enable its reproduction by another having ordinary skill in the relevant 
art.
 Co-sign all taped or glued inserts. The date and signature must be affixed astride the insert 
and its supporting page surface.
 Verify the quality of the information with regard to compliance with Mane's Laboratory 
Notebook Policy, along with laboratory recordkeeping procedures found at the front of the 
laboratory notebook itself.

REVIEW, CERTIFICATION, AND ARCHIVAL PROCESS
3. Certification
The holder/assignee of a laboratory notebook must have it certified, twice a year at the time of 
certification sessions organized in May and November, by a member of Mane's Legal and IP 
Department. 
•
All laboratory notebooks, in progress or completed, must be submitted to the Legal and IP 
Department on the working day immediately preceding the certification date. 
•
Prior to this submission, the holder of a laboratory notebook must ensure that the information 
in each laboratory notebook is correctly recorded, including marking out any significant 
empty space (e.g., marked out with a "Z"), updating the table of contents, as well as 
arranging for the proper witnessing of the notebook.
During certification, each laboratory notebook shall be inspected with regard to compliance 
with this policy. At the end of this inspection, the reviewer will make an entry into the notebook 
and notate the completed inspection by affixing the reviewer's stamp, date, and signature. 
At the end of each certification, the notebook will be promptly returned to its assignee, ideally 
no later than the next working day after certification. 
For remote Innovation sites, arrangements will be made based on the volume of laboratory 
notebooks to enable completion of the certification process without undue expense of time or 
resources.

4. Archiving
Each person assigned to a laboratory notebook is responsible for the maintenance of the
notebook while it is in his/her possession. 
•
must ensure that each assigned laboratory book (s) is stored in a safe and secure location to 
prevent loss, theft, or degradation. 
•
If a laboratory notebook is lost, stolen, or damaged, the assigned person shall immediately 
notify his/her supervisor. 
•
Prior to preserving an electronic copy of a laboratory notebook, the holder must ensure that 
1) the content of the notebook meets the standards set forth in this policy, and 
2) The notebook is certified (per Section 3 above). 
Once a notebook is complete and certified, the holder should make arrangements with the VP 
of R&D to begin the laboratory notebook scanning/archiving process. 
After securing an electronic archival copy of the laboratory notebook, the original hardcopy will 
be returned to its originally assigned holder for a reasonable period, which shall not exceed 
three (3) years from the date of last entry.
After the reasonable retention period, VP of R&D (or site Director) will arrange for long term 
storage of the notebook within a fire resistant container at the local Mane Innovation site.
