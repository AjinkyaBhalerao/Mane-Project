� A Registered Design is the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article.
Ornamental and aesthetic aspect may depend on the shape, pattern or
color of the article.
� The owner of a registered design has the right to prevent third parties from
making, selling, or importing articles bearing or embodying a design which
is a copy of the protected design, when such acts are undertaken for
commercial purposes.
� In most countries, an industrial design needs to be registered in order to be
protected under the term “registered design”.
In some countries, the
Industrial design laws grant, without registration, a time and scope limited
protection called “unregistered industrial design”.

� Trade or Service Mark is a distinctive sign which identifies certain products or services as
those produced or provided by a specific person, company or a group, allowing the
consumer to distinguish them from goods or services of others
�
In order to qualify for protection, the mark must be distinctive and not merely descriptive
�
Generic words or phrases can never be a trademark
�
When the trademark is registered, “®” should be added
�
When the mark is not registered yet or at all, “™” should be added
� To be registered, a trademark application must be filed at a National or Regional Patent and
Trademark Office
�
A trademark right is territorial
�
One should choose a Class for each mark
�
It is necessary to demonstrate that the mark is not fanciful, arbitrary, suggestive, descriptive, i.e.
the mark must be distinctive
�
The mark must be used; it is necessary to provide proof of use to the Office
�
If all these criteria are not fulfilled, the mark can be rejected by the Patent and Trademark
Office

WHERE TO FILE A PATENT APPLICATION?
� There are different routes to patent protection:
� National patent offices (France, U.S., China, Japan etc.)
- National patent valid only in the country where it is granted
- Non-nationals can also apply for a patent
- One year of "priority" for subsequent applications
� European Patent Office (EPO)
- A "European patent" is equivalent to national patents in the countries for which it was granted
- The applicant chooses the countries
- The cost depends on the number of countries designated
� Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)
- Just one initial application for more than 140 contracting states
- After the international phase, the international application leads to multiple national patent
examination procedures
- Costly patenting decisions can be delayed by up to 30-31 months after filing
- No international patent, but an international patent application procedure
- PCT application can be filed at a national patent office, EPO or WIPO

BETAHYDRANE AS A NEUTRALIZING ODOR COMPOUND
� IMPORTANT:
�
If the molecule is marketed as a patented captive, it is important to check if a patent
application/granted has been filed in said country(ies)
�
If the molecule is marketed as a registered trademark, or the trademark is proposed to the customer,
it is important to use the signs ® and ™, and to check before that if said mark has been filed and/or
registered in said country(ies)
�
If the customer needs something like a “Certificate” for the particular action of the captive or
molecule, in this case it is necessary to check that specific analysis have been performed:
�
With a specific range of use of the captive compounds
�
If any, with a specific range of use of the perfume composition comprising the captive
compounds in the final product comprising
�
With the right application
�
If any, in the right final product form or composition
