PATENT PORTFOLIO AUDIT AND LICENSING POLICY

A. Why a licensing policy? (1/2)
� Patents
represent
an
important
investment
notably
financially
for
companies, and are considered as intangible asset that are of importance
in evaluating the value and strength of a company.
� Furthermore, generally speaking, less than 10% of a patent portfolio
contribute towards revenues of a company.
Thus, there is a need to find returns on investments (ROI)
opportunities.

A. Why a licensing policy? (2/2)
� Except for protecting the company’s products (and by extension, its
revenues), a patent portfolio’s returns on investments can be of the
following nature:
� Royalties obtained from licensing out;
� Revenues obtained from selling some of the patents;
� Access to third party patents through cross-licensing deals.

A. Why a portfolio audit?
� A strategic portfolio audit enables Mane to strengthen its IP position and to
identify licensing opportunities.
�Particularly, a portfolio audit allows:
� To satisfy a general need to know what the company has and where the value
in the portfolio lies;
� To identify gaps in protection;
� To survey Mane’s portfolio for patents that are candidates for enforcement
either by licensing or litigation, or that can/should be sold.

B. Methodology (3/3)
� Review the portfolio category by category, with each business/category
manager and answer the following question for each patent:
- is the patent exploited Yes/No?
- is the patent a core patent?
- can the patent technology be exploited in one of Mane’s facility,
Yes/No?
- is the market adequately served Yes/No? Etc…

C. Extraction and classification (1/2)
� After categorization and analysis of the portfolio, we should extract in
collaboration with Management;
� Core patents, i.e., patents essential for Mane because said patents allow
exploitation of another patent for example;
� Defensive patents, i.e., patents that Mane considers as important in view
of its competitors;
� Sufficiently exploited patents, i.e. patents that Mane exploits and serve
adequately the market.
The above patents should not be proposed for licensing
in/out.

C. Extraction and classification (2/2)
� After categorization and analysis of the portfolio, we should extract in
collaboration with Management;
� patent families and/or technology that might be proposed for licensing
out;
� patent families and/or technology that might need licensing in;
� In a perspective of ROI, we obtain a list of “patent of interest for licensing-
out”. Said patents correspond to non-sufficiently exploited or not exploited
at all patents. Cross-licensing is eventually possible with said patents of
interest and/or patents of interest for licensing in.
