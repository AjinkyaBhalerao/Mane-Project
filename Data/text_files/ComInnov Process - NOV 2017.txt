MANE’S INNOVATION PROCESS
Confidential | November 2017
 The ComInnov is defined as MANE’s internal committee to capture, review, and promote all 
innovations in the MANE Group.
 Evaluates the added value of the innovation, confidentiality, interest, and priorities for the Mane Group 
or Region for a proposed innovation project, 
 Selects (validates) innovation projects to be ComInnov Projects
 Decides on intellectual property related actions for all selected ComInnov Projects (including 
protection, sharing, grant of rights, licensing in and out),
 Receives periodic updates on the progress of pending ComInnov Projects during ComInnov meetings,
 Defines the rules applicable to ComInnov Projects for transfer, communication, diffusion to affiliates, 
customers or other partners,
 Closes ComInnov Projects which are no longer active or of interest for MANE.
 ComInnov meets every two to three months.
WHAT IS THE COMINNOV?
Innovation, Valorization and Transfer Committee (ComInnov)
Mane’s ComInnov is a tool that enables global management of innovative projects and products.

Prior to initiating a ComInnov project request, preliminary literature research must be 
performed.
Literature research of patent documents and scientific publications are by researchers and 
by Mane’s Documentalist using key words which are outlined by the project leaders; this 
literature research must include:
 Preliminary “Freedom to operate”:  Mainly focused on identifying pending patent claims
that would prevent Mane from the exploitation of the invention.  More typically at this 
stage, the search is a patent landscape search, to assist in identifying “white space.”
 If a patent is envisioned, then literature research should include:
 Preliminary Patentability:  Mainly based on novelty to answer the questions: 
 “Does the invention already exist?” If no, then
 “What is the closest prior art?”
Search results studied by project leader/team.
 Patent counsel may assist

FREEDOM TO OPERATE STUDY
Cost-free search engines available on the worldwide web for preliminary searching include:
•
http://www.freepatentsonline.com/
•
https://worldwide.espacenet.com/advancedSearch?locale=en_EP
•
http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm
•
http://appft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.html
•
https://patents.google.com/advanced
In order to develop an adequate search strategy (e.g., search terms, class/subclass, assignees, 
etc.), specific information about what you actually want to do/make must be determined.  
MINC and MUSA researchers also have access to Mane’s Documentalist (Didier Geraud), and 
may request assistance.  
US Patent Counsel can assist with preparing search strategy and/or search instructions for the 
Documentalist.

If the research project has been validated as a ComInnov project, approval for FTO search 
must come from the ComInnov.

If not a ComInnov project and no patent is envisioned, then the FTO request may be 
submitted directly to Patent Counsel.

Phase 1: Validation "in principle" by the ComInnov of the interest that Mane may have in employing internal 
resources dedicated to technical development and intellectual property work with the goal to initiate a 
patent application.
− If ComInnov validation is obtained, then project may progress to phase 2.
Phase 2: Patentability study made by Mane patent counsel on the basis of novelty, non-obviousness, utility 
(for Mane), enablement vis-à-vis the publically available prior art.
− If the patentability study is favourable, and after the execution of the possible complementary developments, the project 
may be approved by the ComInnov to progress to phase 3.
Phase 3: Freedom to operate study made by Mane patent counsel focusing on geographically relevant 
claims in non-expired patents and pending patent applications, both of which are presumed valid.
− If the freedom-to-operate study is favourable, and after other possible complementary developments, the project may be 
approved by the ComInnov to proceed with pursuit of patent protection and onto phase 4.
Phase 4: Validation by the ComInnov of the decision to file a patent application, will be based on favourable 
opinions from the patentability study and the FTO study, as well as possible complementary developments.
This validation phase specifies the scope of patent application and the patent filing strategy (FR, EP, US 
application, PCT, etc.).
− If validation from the ComInnov is obtained, the patent application may proceed to phase 5.
Phase 5: Drafting of the patent application by Mane patent counsel, in full collaboration with the inventors, 
together with possible complementary developments.
− Only at the end of this phase 5, can the patent application be filed.
COMINNOV PROCESS
Compulsory steps on the path from innovation to patent protection
All Mane patent applications must go through the ComInnov to be approved for drafting and filing.

MANE’S INNOVATION PROCESS

FREEDOM TO OPERATE STUDY
A Freedom to Operate (FTO) study answers the question:  “If I do X, will I be 
liable for infringing another’s patent?”
So what is patent infringement?  
When a party (other than the patentee or licensee of the patentee) manufactures, imports, uses, sells, 
or offers for sale patented technology without permission/license from the patentee, during the term of 
the patent and within the country that issued the patent.
“USE” does not have to be actual use in commerce.  Even research may be sufficient to give rise to 
patent infringement liability.  In the U.S., the so-called “research exemption” defense to patent 
infringement does not apply where the research is done in furtherance of the alleged infringers 
legitimate business.  This very narrow and strictly limited experimental use defense applies when the acts 
are for amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strictly philosophical inquiry. 
Infringement may be direct or indirect.
•
Direct
•
Literal (patent claim “reads on” the process, machine, manufacture, or composition) 
•
under the Doctrine of Equivalents (function, way, result)
•
Indirect
•
Contributory (custom designed component without substantial non-infringing use)
•
Inducement (specific intent = actual knowledge + affirmative acts)

FREEDOM TO OPERATE STUDY
An FTO study is confined to analysis of the claims of enforceable patents and pending 
patent applications of the last 20 years, and only in the countries or regions of proposed 
exploitation. 
•
The specification may be referenced to interpret the terms recited in the claims.
•
All relevant patent documents are checked for status (abandoned, fees paid, etc.).
Procedure:
1. Develop search strategy based on invention description and known prior art.
a. e.g., terms, invention classification, assignees, inventors, countries of interest
b. may use preliminary search results to assist with developing search strategy
2.
Collect search results of this formal FTO search
3.
Analyze claims of patent documents to establish relevancy to proposed project
4.
Assess status of any relevant patent documents
5.
Render a written opinion providing FTO guidance
a. The project/invention is free to operate, meaning that no enforceable patents or 
pending patent applications hinder Mane’s right to exploit said project/invention.
b. If enforceable patents or pending patent applications block our FTO
i.
If available, commercialize in alternative countries
ii.
Periodically monitor problematic patent documents for abandonment, 
invalidation, etc.
iii.
Work with researchers to develop work around strategies, if possible.
MANE FTO policy is to always respect third party patents and patent applications.

PATENTABILITY STUDY
Studying the patentability of an innovation means evaluating the three criteria of 
patentability:
1: Novelty
2: Non-obviousness / Inventive step 
3: Utility / Industrial applicability
In order to accomplish the study, it is necessary to provide Patent Counsel:
1. A complete and detailed description of the invention
- ingredients, including compositional make-up of impure materials, extracts, fractions, EOs 
- acceptable ranges for each ingredient
- methods of manufacturing
- equipment used
- expected applications
- benefits of the invention vis-à-vis the prior art
2. Any known relevant prior art
- include search results from preliminary search
- identify competitors who may have art in this innovation space

PATENTABILITY STUDY
Procedure:
1. Develop a search strategy based on invention description and known prior art.
a. Envision hypothetical claim(s) for the invention
b. identify alternative terms, generic terms
c. classify invention, related art from preliminary searches may be useful
c. identify potential sources of relevant non-patent literature 
2.
Collect search results based on search of patent and non-patent literature
3.
Analyze search result pool to identify if relevant to proposed claim(s)
a. Novel - If a single reference does not teach all elements, as arranged in the claim.
b. Non-obvious –
i)
United States uses the Graham factor test: 
1. Determining the scope and contents of the prior art;
2. Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention;
3. Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art; and
4. Consider objective evidence indicating obviousness or non-obviousness.
5. Consider “secondary indicia of non-obviousness,” 
(1) long-felt need; (2) failure of others; (3) commercial success; (4) commercial 
acquiescence via licensing; (5) professional approval; (6) copying by and 
praise from infringers; (7) progress through the PTO; (8) near-simultaneous 
invention; and (9) unexpected results.  
ii)
Other jurisdictions (EP, CN, JP, etc.) utilize a “problem -solution approach.”
4.
Render a written opinion detailing patentability assessment
