DEFINITION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Intellectual Property (IP) generally refers to creations of the mind: inventions; literary 
and artistic works; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.
Corporate IP includes copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, as well as other 
business related things such as methodologies, goodwill, and brand recognition.
Intellectual property rights allow creators, or owners, of the IP to benefit from their own 
work or investment in a creation.

COPYRIGHTS
Copyright protects original and derivative works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.
•
Protect original works of authorship, such as literary works, music, dramatic works, 
pantomimes and choreographic works, sculptural, pictorial, and graphic works, 
sound recordings, artistic works, architectural works, and computer software. 
•
In order to qualify under copyright laws, the work must be fixed in a tangible 
medium of expression, such as words on a piece of paper, or music notes written 
on a sheet. 
•
A copyright exists from the moment the work is created, so registration is voluntary.  
To provide public notice of copyright, published works must be marked (©, date, 
and owner). If registered, certain statutory rights are available. 
•
The owner has the exclusive rights to modify, distribute, perform, create, display, 
and copy the work.

COPYRIGHTS
Duration - Limited per the US Constitution (Art. I, Sec. 8) 
•
Exact duration depends on when created, if/when published, if work for hire.
•
Today, new works are entitled to life of the author plus 70 years.
•
Today, work for hires are entitled to a term of 95 years from the year of its first 
publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever 
expires first.
A “work made for hire” is a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or 
her employment.
In the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other person for whom the work 
was prepared is considered the author for purposes of this title, and owns all of the 
rights comprised in the copyright.
•
unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument 
signed by them.

Presentations, Advertisements, Marketing brochures, Websites, Scientific articles
•
BUT NOT patents (see Korzybski v. Underwood & Underwood, 36 F.2d 727, 729 (Cir. 1929))
FAIR USE:
• the purpose and character of the use
• transformative or value added
• merely copied
• the nature of the copyrighted work
• factual or fictional  
• published or unpublished

TRADEMARKS
Trade/Service mark is a word, phrase, symbol, or design that provides distinctive identification for goods/services.
Trade or Service Mark - a distinctive sign which identifies certain products or 
services as those produced or provided by a specific person, enterprise or a group of 
persons/enterprises allowing the consumer to distinguish them from goods or services 
of others.
In order to qualify for protection, the mark must be distinctive and not 
merely descriptive. 
Scale for distinctiveness of a trademark: Fanciful, arbitrary, suggestive, 
descriptive, and generic.  
Marks that are fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive are considered distinctive 
enough to function as trademarks. 
If a mark is descriptive, the mark can function as a trademark or service 
mark only if it has obtained secondary meaning. 
Generic words or phrases can never be a trademark.
® denotes a registered mark
TM denotes common law use as a mark.

Application process based on:
§1a) actual use in commerce, or 
§1b) bona fide intent-to-use (ITU) in commerce.
Classes 1-34 (goods) and 35-45 (services) for US and international (NICE)
Majority of trademark application rejections are based on marks being merely 
descriptive or “likelihood of confusion” of the source of the goods.

TRADE SECRETS
Defend Trade Secrets Act (2016):
•
A United States federal law (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1836) that allows an owner of a trade 
secret to sue in federal court when its trade secrets have been misappropriated.
•
State courts still available under common law trademark or unfair competition
•
"Misappropriation" means: 
•
(i) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade 
secret was acquired by improper means; or 
•
(ii) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who (A) 
used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or (B) at the time of disclosure or use, 
knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was 
•
(I) derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it; 
•
(II) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or 
•
(III) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its 
secrecy or limit its use; or before a material change of his [or her] position, knew or had reason to 
know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.
•
"Improper means" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a 
breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other means.

PATENTS
17
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASICS (US)

PATENTS
A patent is an exclusive right for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.
Once granted, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to exclude others from 
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the claimed invention for the term of the 
patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date, subject to the payment of maintenance 
fees.
•
A patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention.
•
Patents are territorial, and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in 
force.
•
The granted claims in the specific country are what defines the scope of enforcement.
•
Patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented 
invention without permission from the patent holder. 
•
Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license.
•
Maintenance fees vary from country to country, and when payment is due.
The basic quid pro quo contemplated by the Constitution and the Congress for granting a 
patent monopoly is the benefit derived by the public from an invention with substantial utility.  
The public disclosure of scientific and technical information is part of the consideration that the 
inventor gives the public.
18

PATENTS
Claims define the metes and bounds of the patentee’s exclusive right.
What defines an invention?
The claims, not the specification, provide notice of the scope of patent protection. The scope 
of claims is determined by interpreting the language of the claims in light of the intrinsic 
evidence, including the claims themselves, the specification, the relevant prior art, and the 
prosecution history, as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art. 
•
Neither the specification, which includes the written description of the invention, nor the 
drawings accompanying the specification, can be infringed.
•
Claims must first be construed without reference to an accused product before they can be 
applied, as so construed, to the accused product to determine infringement.  
•
All limitations in a claim must be considered meaningful and cannot be ignored as 
insignificant or immaterial in determining infringement. 
•
Beware the “Doctrine of Equivalents.”
•
“comprising” vs. “consisting essentially of” vs. “consisting of”

PATENTS
Novel and Useful (35 U.S.C. §101/102, see also EPC Art. 54, 57)
•
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or 
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent 
therefor…. 
Non-Obvious (35 U.S.C. §103, see also EPC Art. 56)
•
A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, … if the differences between the 
claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole 
would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a 
person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains. 
Written Description/Enablement (35 U.S.C. §112, see also EPC Art. 83)
•
…a written description of the invention, …, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable
any person skilled in the art … to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best 
mode … of carrying out the invention.

TRADE SECRETS VERSUS PATENTS
Patents and trade secrets each have their own inherent advantages and limitations. 
Trade Secrets
Patents
Trade secrets involve no registration costs
Patents may cost tens of thousands of dollars, per 
jurisdiction 
Trade secrets have immediate effect and may last 
indefinitely
Average time to obtain a patent is five years, and a
patent expires up to 20 years* after earliest filing date
Trade secret protection does not require any formalities 
such as disclosure of the information to a Government 
authority.
Inventors must disclose the invention to the public, 
without a guarantee of obtaining a patent*
Some trade secrets are susceptible to reverse 
engineering
Exclusive rights of patents allows protection from any 
type of infringement or copying — whether intentional 
or unintentional.
Once the secret is made public, anyone may have 
access to it and use it at will
Quid pro quo for a limited monopoly to exclude others is 
public disclosure of the invention
A trade secret may be patented by another “inventor”
but prior commercial use defense is available (35 USC 
273) 
Independent invention is no defense against patent 
infringement
A trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent;
must show misappropriation
Patent infringement covers direct and indirect 
infringement
