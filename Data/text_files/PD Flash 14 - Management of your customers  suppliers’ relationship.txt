Flash DP 14 - GDPR: Management of your customers / suppliers’ relationship

The control of the personal data of our customers, prospects or suppliers constitutes a guarantee of quality and trust regarding MANE.
This requires that specific rules are needed when you the collect and use of personal data (name, e-mail, telephone number, postal address, etc.) for the purposes of establishing a commercial relationship.
Depending on the prospecting method (email, telephone or text message) that you use, the persons contacted must first have given their consent to receive your messages (opt-in, generally in B2C) or not have expressed their refusal (opt- out, usually in B2B).
In any case, people should be able to refuse to receive further requests from you. Offer them this possibility when you contact them (example: an unsubscribe link in your emails) and take these requests into account (example: update the list of people contacted and the list of people who objected).
If your operations are intended to retain your customers / suppliers think about the following 3 rules:
- The collection of certain personal data is not imperative for all commercial approaches. You must justify the usefulness of all the personal data collected and processed (e.g. fax number if never used).
- At the time of collection, inform your customers / suppliers about what you will do with their data, by sending them our GTC, an information notice on the document intended to collect personal data or an information e-mail by example. Do not forget to provide them with the address dpo@mane.com to contact for the exercise of their rights of access, rectification, opposition and erasure.
- Do not keep their data indefinitely. Plan the deletion of information in the event of a prolonged commercial relationship with your customers / suppliers (The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL) as the independent French administrative regulatory body whose mission is to ensure that data privacy law is applied to the collection, storage, and use of personal data- recommends a maximum data retention period of 3 years from the end of the commercial relationship). If, however, you must keep certain data due to legal obligations beyond this period, archive them in another database who’s access is more restricted.
