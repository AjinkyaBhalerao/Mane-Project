INCOTERMS® 2020\\n2\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC) I. WHAT THE INCOTERMS® RULES DO\\n4.\\tThe Incoterms® rules explain a set of eleven of the most \\n commonly-used three-letter trade terms, e.g. CIF, DAP, etc., \\nreflecting business-to-business practice in contracts for the sale \\nand purchase of goods. \\n5.\\tThe Incoterms® rules describe:\\n``Obligations: Who does what as between seller and buyer, \\ne.g. who organises carriage or insurance of the goods  \\nor who obtains shipping documents and export or \\nimport\\xa0licences;\\n``Risk: Where and when the seller “delivers” the goods,  \\nin other words where risk transfers from seller to buyer; and\\n``Costs : Which party is responsible for which costs, for \\nexample transport, packaging, loading or unloading costs, \\nand checking or security-related costs.\\nThe Incoterms® rules cover these areas in a set of ten articles, \\nnumbered A1/B1 etc., the A articles representing the seller’s \\nobligations and the B articles representing the buyer’s obliga-\\ntions. See paragraph 53 below.\\n II. WHAT THE INCOTERMS® RULES DO NOT DO\\n6.\\tThe Incoterms® rules are NOT in themselves—and are therefore \\nno substitute for—a contract of sale. They are devised to reflect \\ntrade practice for no particular type of goods—and for any . \\nThey can be used as much for the trading of a bulk cargo of \\niron ore as for five containers of electronic equipment or ten \\npallets of airfreighted fresh flowers. \\n7.\\tThe Incoterms® rules do NOT deal with the following matters:\\n``whether there is a contract of sale at all;\\n``the specifications of the goods sold;\\n``the time, place, method or currency of payment  \\nof the price; \\n``the remedies which can be sought for breach  \\nof the contract of\\xa0sale;\\n``most consequences of delay and other breaches  \\nin the performance of contractual obligations;\\n``the effect of sanctions;\\n``the imposition of tariffs; \\n``export or import prohibitions; \\n``force majeure or hardship;\\n``intellectual property rights; or\\n``the method, venue, or law of dispute resolution in case  \\nof such breach.INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 3Perhaps most importantly, it must be stressed that the \\n Incoterms® rules do NOT deal with the transfer of property/\\ntitle/ownership of the goods sold. \\n8.\\tThese are matters for which the parties need to make specific \\nprovision in their contract of sale. Failure to do so is likely to \\ncause problems later if disputes arise about performance  \\nand breach. In essence, the Incoterms® 2020 rules are not \\nthemselves a contract of sale: they only become part of that \\ncontract when they are incorporated into a contract which \\nalready exists. Neither do the Incoterms® rules provide the law \\napplicable to the contract. There may be legal regimes which \\napply to the contract, whether international, like the Conven-\\ntion on the International Sale of Goods (CISG);  \\nor domestic mandatory law relating, for example, to health  \\nand safety or the environment.\\n III. HOW BEST TO INCORPORATE THE INCOTERMS® RULES \\n9.\\tIf parties want the Incoterms® 2020 rules to apply to their \\ncontract, the safest way to ensure this is to make that intention \\nclear in their contract, through words such as\\n“[the chosen Incoterms® rule] [named port, place  \\nor point] Incoterms® 2020”. \\n10.\\tThus, for example,  \\nCIF Shanghai Incoterms® 2020, or  \\nDAP No 123, ABC Street, Importland Incoterms® 2020.\\n11.\\tLeaving the year out could cause problems that may be \\ndifficult to resolve. The parties, a judge or an arbitrator need  \\nto be able to determine which version of the Incoterms® rules \\napplies to the contract.\\n12.\\tThe place named next to the chosen Incoterms® rule is even \\nmore important:\\n``in all Incoterms® rules except the C rules, the named place \\nindicates where the goods are “delivered”, i.e. where risk \\ntransfers from seller to buyer; \\n``in the D rules, the named place is the place of delivery and \\nalso the place of destination and the seller must organise \\ncarriage to that point;\\n``in the C rules, the named place indicates the destination  \\nto which the seller must organise and pay for the carriage \\nof the goods, which is not, however, the place or port  \\nof delivery. \\n13.\\tThus, an FOB sale raising doubt about the port of shipment \\nleaves both parties uncertain as to where the buyer must \\npresent the ship to the seller for the shipment and the trans-\\nport of the goods—and as to where the seller must deliver the \\ngoods on board so as to transfer risk in the goods from seller \\nto buyer. Again, a CPT contract with an unclear named INCOTERMS® 2020\\n4\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC) destination will leave both parties in doubt as to the point  \\nto which the seller must contract and pay for the transport  \\nof the goods.\\n14.\\tIt is best to avoid these types of issues by being as geographi-\\ncally specific as possible in naming the port, place  \\nor point, as the case may be, in the chosen Incoterms® rule.\\n15.\\tWhen incorporating a particular Incoterms® 2020 rule into a \\nsale contract, it is not necessary to use the trademark symbol. \\nFor further guidance on trademark and copyright, please refer \\nto https://iccwbo.org/incoterms-copyright/. \\n IV. DELIVERY, RISK AND COSTS IN THE \\nINCOTERMS®\\xa02020\\xa0RULES\\n16.\\tA named place or port attached to the three letters, e.g. CIP \\nLas Vegas or CIF Los Angeles, then, is critical in the workings \\nof the Incoterms® 2020 rules. Depending on which Incoterms® \\n2020 rule is chosen, that place will identify either the place  \\nor port at which the goods are considered to have been \\n“delivered” by the seller to the buyer, the place of “delivery”,  \\nor the place or port to which the seller must organise the \\ncarriage of the goods, i.e. their destination; or, in the case  \\nof the D rules,\\xa0both. \\n17.\\tIn all Incoterms® 2020 rules, A2 will define the place or port of \\n“delivery”—and that place or port is closest to the seller in EXW \\nand FCA (seller’s premises) and closest to the buyer in DAP, \\nDPU and DDP.\\n18.\\tThe place or port of delivery identified by A2 is critical both  \\nfor risk and for costs.\\n19.\\tThe place or port of delivery under A2 marks the place at \\nwhich risk transfers from seller to buyer under A3. It is at that \\nplace or port that the seller performs its obligation to provide \\nthe goods under the contract as reflected in A1 such that the \\nbuyer cannot recover against the seller for the loss of or \\ndamage to the goods occurring after that point has passed.\\n20.\\tThe place or port of delivery under A2 also marks the central \\npoint under A9 which allocates costs to seller and buyer. In \\nbroad terms, A9 allocates costs before the point of delivery  \\nto the seller and costs after that point to the buyer. \\n Delivery points  \\nExtremes and in-betweens: the four traditional Incoterms® \\nrules groups\\n21.\\tVersions of the Incoterms® rules before 2010 traditionally \\ngrouped the rules into four, namely E, F, C and D, with E and D \\nlying at extreme poles from each other in terms of the point  \\nof delivery and the F and C rules lying in between. While the \\nIncoterms® rules have, since 2010, been grouped according  INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 5to the means of transport used, the old groupings are still \\nhelpful in understanding the point of delivery. Thus, the \\ndelivery point in EXW is an agreed point for collection of the \\ngoods by the buyer, whatever the destination to which the \\nbuyer will take them. At the other extreme in DAP, DPU and \\nDDP, the delivery point is the same as the destination point to \\nwhich the seller or its carrier will carry the goods. In the first, \\nEXW, risk transfers before the transport cycle even starts; in \\nthe second, the D rules, risk transfers very late in that cycle. \\nAgain, in the first, EXW and, for that matter, FCA (seller’s \\npremises), the seller performs its obligation to deliver the \\ngoods whether or not they actually arrive at their destination. \\nIn the second, the seller performs its obligation to deliver the \\ngoods only if they actually arrive at their destination.\\n22.\\tThe two rules at the extreme ends of the Incoterms® rules are \\nEXW and DDP. However, traders should consider alternative \\nrules to these two for their international contracts. Thus, with \\nEXW the seller has to merely put the goods at the buyer’s \\ndisposal. This may cause problems for the seller and the buyer, \\nrespectively, with loading and export clearance. The seller \\nwould be better advised to sell under the FCA rule. Likewise, \\nwith DDP, the seller owes some obligations to the buyer which \\ncan only be performed within the buyer’s country, for example \\nobtaining import clearance. It may be physically or legally \\ndifficult for the seller to carry out those obligations within the \\nbuyer’s country and a seller would therefore be better advised \\nto consider selling goods in such circumstances under the DAP \\nor DPU rules. \\n23.\\tBetween the two extremes of E and D rules, there lie the three \\nF rules (FCA, FAS and FOB), and the four C rules (CPT, CIP, \\nCFR and CIF).\\n24.\\tWith all seven F and C rules, the place of delivery is on the \\nseller’s side of the anticipated carriage: consequently sales \\nusing these Incoterms® rules are often called “shipment” sales. \\nDelivery occurs, for example, \\na)\\twhen the goods are placed on board the vessel at the port \\nof loading in CFR, CIF and FOB; or\\nb)\\tby handing the goods over to the carrier in CPT and CIP; or \\nc)\\tby loading them on the means of transport provided by the \\nbuyer or placing them at the disposal of the buyer’s carrier \\nin\\xa0FCA. \\nIn the F and C groups, risk transfers at the seller’s end of the \\nmain carriage such that the seller will have performed its \\nobligation to deliver the goods whether or not the goods \\nactually arrive at their destination. This feature, of being \\nshipment sales with delivery happening at the seller’s end early INCOTERMS® 2020\\n6\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)in the transit cycle, is common to the F and the C rules, \\nwhether they are the maritime Incoterms® rules or the \\n Incoterms® rules intended for any mode[s] of transport. \\n25.\\tThe F and the C rules do, however, differ as to whether it is the \\nseller or buyer who contracts for or arranges the carriage of \\nthe goods beyond the place or port of delivery. In the F rules, \\nit\\xa0is the buyer who makes such arrangements, unless the parties \\nagree otherwise. In the C rules, this obligation falls to the seller.\\n26.\\tGiven that a seller on any of the C rules contracts for or \\narranges the carriage of the goods beyond delivery, the parties \\nneed to know what the destination is to which it must arrange \\ncarriage—and that is the place attached to the name of the \\nIncoterms® rule, e.g. “CIF the port of Dalian” or “CIP the inland \\ncity of Shenyang”. Whatever that named destination is, that \\nplace is not and never becomes the place of delivery. Risk will \\nhave transferred on shipment or on handing over the goods at \\nthe place of delivery, but the contract of carriage must have \\nbeen made by the seller for the named destination. Delivery \\nand destination, then, in the C rules, are necessarily not the \\nsame place.\\n V. INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES AND THE CARRIER \\n27.\\tIn the F and the C rules, placing the goods, for example, on \\nboard the vessel or handing them over to, or placing them at \\nthe disposal of, the carrier marks the point at which the goods \\nare “delivered” by the seller to the buyer. Therefore this is the \\npoint at which risk transfers from the seller to the buyer. \\n28.\\tGiven those two important consequences, it becomes essential \\nto identify who the carrier is where there is more than one \\ncarrier, each carrying out a separate leg of transport, for \\ninstance by road, rail, air or sea. Of course, where the seller has \\ntaken the far more prudent course of making one contract of \\ncarriage with one carrier taking responsibility for the entire \\ncarriage chain, in a so-called “through” contract of carriage,  \\nthe problem does not arise. However, where there is no such \\n“through” carriage contract, the goods could be handed over \\n(where the CIP or CPT rules are used) to a road-haulier or rail \\ncompany for onward transmission to a sea carrier. The same \\nsituation may  arise with exclusively maritime transport where, \\nfor example, the goods are first handed over to a river or \\nfeeder short-sea carrier for onward transmission to an \\nocean\\xa0carrier. \\n29.\\tIn these situations, when does the seller “deliver” the goods to \\nthe buyer: when it hands the goods over to the first, second or \\nthird carrier? \\n30.\\tBefore we answer that question, a preliminary point. While  \\nin most cases the carrier will be an independent third party \\nengaged under a contract of carriage by either the seller or the INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 7buyer (depending on whether the parties have chosen a C \\nIncoterms® rule or an F Incoterms® rule), there are situations \\nwhere no such independent third party is engaged at all \\nbecause the seller or the buyer itself will carry the goods sold. \\nThis is more likely to happen in the D rules (DAP, DPU and \\nDDP), where the seller may use its own means of transport  \\nto carry the goods to the buyer at the delivery destination. \\nProvision has therefore been made in the Incoterms® 2020 rules \\nfor a seller under the D rules either to contract for carriage  \\nor to arrange for carriage, that is to say through its own means \\nof transport: see A4. \\n31.\\tThe question asked at paragraph 29 above is not simply a \\n“carriage” question: it is an important “sale” question. The \\nquestion is not which carrier can a seller or buyer of goods \\ndamaged in transit sue under the contract of carriage. The \\n“sale” question is: where there is more than one carrier involved \\nin the carriage of the goods from seller to buyer, at which point \\nin the carriage string does the handing over of the goods mark \\nthe point of delivery and the transfer of risk as between seller \\nand buyer? \\n32.\\tThere needs to be a simple answer to this question because the \\nrelationships between the multiple carriers used, and between \\nthe seller and/or the buyer with those several carriers, will be \\ncomplex, depending as they do on the terms of a number of \\nseparate contracts of carriage. Thus, for example, in any such \\nchain of contracts of carriage, one carrier, such as a carrier \\nactually performing a leg of the transit by road, may well act  \\nas the seller’s agent in concluding a contract of carriage with  \\na carrier by sea. \\n33.\\tThe Incoterms® 2020 rules give a clear answer to this question \\nwhere the parties contract on FCA. In FCA, the relevant carrier \\nis the carrier nominated by the buyer to whom the seller hands \\nover the goods at the place or point agreed in the contract of \\nsale. Thus even if a seller engages a road haulier to take the \\ngoods to the agreed delivery point, risk would transfer not at \\nthe place and time where the seller hands the goods over to \\nthe haulier engaged by the seller, but at the place and time \\nwhere the goods are placed at the disposal of the carrier \\nengaged by the buyer. This is why the naming of the place or \\npoint of delivery as precisely as possible is so important in FCA \\nsales. The same situation can arise in FOB if a seller engages a \\nfeeder vessel or barge to take the goods to the vessel engaged \\nby the buyer. A similar answer is provided by Incoterms®  2020: \\ndelivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the \\nbuyer’s carrier. \\n34.\\tWith the C rules, the position is more complex and may well \\nattract different solutions under different legal systems. In CPT \\nand CIP, the relevant carrier is likely to be regarded, at any rate \\nin some jurisdictions, as the first carrier to whom the seller INCOTERMS® 2020\\n8\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)hands over the goods under A2 (unless the parties have agreed \\non the point of delivery). The buyer knows nothing of the \\ncontractual arrangements made between the seller and the \\nfirst or subsequent carriers, or indeed between that first carrier \\nand subsequent carriers. What the buyer does know, however, \\nis that the goods are “in transit” to him or her—and that \\n“transit” starts as far as the buyer knows, when the goods are \\nput by the seller into the hands of the first carrier. The conse-\\nquence is that risk transfers from seller to buyer at that early \\nstage of “delivery” to the first carrier. The same situation can \\narise in CFR and CIF if a seller engages a feeder vessel or barge \\nto take the goods to the agreed port of shipment, if any. A \\nsimilar answer might be suggested in some legal systems: \\ndelivery occurs when the goods are placed on board the vessel \\nat the agreed port of shipment, if any. \\n35.\\tSuch a conclusion, if adopted, may seem harsh on the buyer. \\nRisk would transfer from seller to buyer in CPT and CIP sales \\nwhen the goods are handed over to the first carrier. The buyer \\ndoes not know at that stage whether or not that first carrier is \\nresponsible for loss of or damage to the goods under the \\nrelevant carriage contract. The buyer is not a party to that \\ncontract, has no control over it and will not know its terms.  \\nYet, despite this, the buyer would end up bearing the risk in the \\ngoods from the very earliest moment of handing over, possibly \\nwithout recovery against that first carrier. \\n36.\\tWhile the buyer would end up bearing the risk of loss of or \\ndamage to the goods at an early stage of the transport chain,  \\nit would, on this view however, have a remedy against the \\nseller. A2/A3 do not operate in a vacuum: under A4, the seller \\nmust contract for the carriage of the goods “from the agreed \\npoint of delivery, if any, at the place of delivery to the named \\nplace of destination or, if agreed, any point at that place.” Even \\nif risk has transferred to the buyer at the time the goods were \\nhanded over to the first carrier under A2/A3, if that first carrier \\ndoes not undertake responsibility under its contract of carriage \\nfor the through carriage of the goods to the named destina -\\ntion, the seller, on this view, would remain liable to the buyer \\nunder A4. In essence, the seller should make a contract of \\ncarriage to the destination named under the contract of sale. \\n VI. RULES FOR THE CONTRACT OF SALE AND THEIR \\nRELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CONTRACTS\\n37.\\tThis discussion of the role of the carrier in the delivery of the \\ngoods as between the seller and the buyer in the C and F \\nIncoterms® rules raises the question: what role do the \\n Incoterms® rules play in the contract of carriage, or, indeed,  \\nin any of the other contracts typically surrounding an export \\ncontract, for example an insurance contract or a letter \\nof\\xa0credit? INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 938.\\tThe short answer is that the Incoterms® rules do not form part \\nof those other contracts: where incorporated, the Incoterms® \\nrules apply to and govern only certain aspects of the contract \\nof sale. \\n39.\\tThis is not the same as saying, however, that the Incoterms® \\nrules have no impact on those other contracts. Goods are \\nexported and imported through a network of contracts that,  \\nin an ideal world, should match the one with the other. Thus, \\nthe sale contract, for example, will require the tender of a \\ntransport document issued by the carrier to the seller/shipper \\nunder a contract of carriage and against which the seller/\\nshipper/beneficiary might wish to be paid under a letter of \\ncredit. Where the three contracts match, things go well; where \\nthey do not, problems rapidly arise. \\n40.\\tWhat the Incoterms® rules say, for example, about carriage or \\ntransport documents (in A4/B4 and A6/B6), or what they say \\nabout insurance cover (A5/B5), does not bind the carrier or \\nthe insurer or any of the banks involved. Thus, a carrier is only \\nbound to issue a transport document as required by the \\ncontract of carriage it makes with the other party to that  \\ncontract: it is not bound to issue a transport document com-\\nplying with the Incoterms® rules. Likewise, an insurer is bound \\nto issue a policy to the level and in the terms agreed with the \\nparty purchasing the insurance, not a policy which complies \\nwith the Incoterms® rules. Finally, a bank will look only at the \\ndocumentary requirements in the letter of credit, if any, not at \\nthe requirements of the sales contract.\\n41.\\tHowever, it is very much in the interests of all the parties to the \\ndifferent contracts in the network to ensure that the carriage  \\nor insurance terms they have agreed with the carrier or insurer, \\nor the terms of a letter of credit, comply with what the sale \\ncontract says about ancillary contracts that need to be made \\nor documents that need to be obtained and tendered. That \\ntask does not fall on the carrier, the insurer or the bank, none  \\nof whom are party to the contract of sale and none of whom \\nare, therefore, party to or bound by the Incoterms® 2020 rules. \\nIt is, however, in the seller’s and buyer’s interest to try to ensure \\nthat the different parts of the network of contracts match—and \\nthe starting point is the sale contract—and therefore, where \\nthey apply, the Incoterms® 2020 rules. \\n VII. THE ELEVEN INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES—“SEA \\nAND INLAND WATERWAY” AND “ANY MODE(S) OF \\nTRANSPORT”: GETTING IT RIGHT\\n42.\\tThe main distinction introduced in the Incoterms® 2010 rules, \\nthat between Rules for any Mode or Modes of Transport  \\n(comprising EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, the newly named INCOTERMS® 2020\\n10\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)DPU—the old DAT—and DDP), and Rules for Sea and Inland \\nWaterway Transport, (comprising FAS, FOB, CFR and CIF)  \\nhas been retained. \\n43.\\tThe four so-called “maritime” Incoterms® rules are intended for \\nuse where the seller places the goods on board (or in FAS \\nalongside) a vessel at a sea or river port. It is at this point that \\nthe seller delivers the goods to the buyer. When these rules are \\nused, the risk of loss of or damage to those goods is on the \\nbuyer’s shoulders from that port. \\n44.\\tThe seven Incoterms® rules for any mode or modes of transport \\n(so-called “multi-modal”), on the other hand, are intended for \\nuse where\\na)\\tthe point at which the seller hands the goods over to,  \\nor places them at the disposal of, a carrier, or \\nb)\\tthe point at which the carrier hands the goods over to the \\nbuyer, or the point at which they are placed at the disposal \\nof the buyer, or\\nc)\\tboth points (a) and (b) \\nare not on board (or in FAS alongside) a vessel. \\n45.\\tWhere delivery happens and risk transfers in each of these \\nseven Incoterms® rules will depend on which particular rule is \\nused. For example, in CPT, delivery happens at the seller’s end \\nwhen the goods are handed over to the carrier contracted by \\nthe seller. In DAP, on the other hand, delivery happens when \\nthe goods are placed at the buyer’s disposal at the named \\nplace or point of destination.\\n46.\\tThe order in which the Incoterms® 2010 rules were presented \\nhas, as we have said, been largely retained in Incoterms®  2020  \\nand it is important to underline the distinction between the two \\nfamilies of Incoterms® rules so that the right rule is used for the \\ncontract of sale depending on the means of transport used. \\n47.\\tOne of the most frequent problems in the use of the Incoterms® \\nrules is the choice of the wrong rule for the particular type \\nof\\xa0contract. \\n48.\\tThus, for example, an FOB inland point (for example an airport \\nor a warehouse) sale contract makes little sense: what type of \\ncontract of carriage must the buyer make? Does the buyer owe \\nthe seller an obligation to make a contract of carriage under \\nwhich the carrier is bound to take over the goods at the named \\ninland point or at the nearest port to that point? \\n49.\\tAgain, a CIF named sea port sale contract where the buyer \\nexpects the goods to be brought to an inland point in the \\nbuyer’s country makes little sense. Must the seller procure a \\ncontract of carriage and insurance cover to the eventual inland \\ndestination intended by the parties or to the seaport named in \\nthe sale contract? INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 1150.\\tGaps, overlaps and unnecessary costs are likely to arise—and all \\nthis because the wrong Incoterms® rule has been chosen for \\nthe particular contract. What makes the mismatch “wrong” is \\nthat insufficient regard has been given to the two most \\nimportant features of the Incoterms® rules, features which are \\nmirrors of each other, namely the port, place or point of \\ndelivery and the transfer of risks. \\n51.\\tThe reason for the frequent misuse of the wrong Incoterms® \\nrule is that Incoterms® rules are frequently regarded exclusively \\nas price indicators: this or that is the EXW, FOB, or DAP price. \\nThe initials used in the Incoterms® rules are doubtless handy \\nabbreviations for the formula used in the calculation of the \\nprice. Incoterms® rules are not, however, exclusively, or even \\nprimarily, price indicators. They are a list of general obligations \\nthat sellers and buyers owe each other under well-recognised \\nforms of sale contract—and one of their main tasks is to \\nindicate the port, place or point of delivery where the risk \\nis\\xa0transferred. \\n VIII. ORDER WITHIN THE INCOTERMS® 2020 RULES\\n52.\\tAll the ten A/B articles in each of the Incoterms® rules are \\nimportant—but some are more important than others. \\n53.\\tThere has, indeed, been a radical shake-up in the internal order \\nin which the ten articles within each Incoterms® rule have been \\norganised. In Incoterms® 2020, the internal order within each \\nIncoterms® rule now follows this sequence:\\nA1/B1 General obligations\\nA2/B2 Delivery/Taking delivery\\nA3/B3 Transfer of risks \\nA4/B4 Carriage\\nA5/B5 Insurance\\nA6/B6 Delivery/transport document\\nA7/B7 Export/import clearance\\nA8/B8 Checking/packaging/marking\\nA9/B9 Allocation of costs\\nA10/B10 Notices\\n54.\\tIt will be noticed that concerning the Incoterms® 2020 rules, \\nafter recording in A1/B1 the basic goods/payment obligations \\nof the parties, Delivery and the Transfer of risks are moved to a \\nmore prominent location, namely to A2 and A3 respectively.\\n55.\\tThe broad sequence thereafter goes: \\n``ancillary contracts (A4/B4 and A5/B5, carriage and \\ninsurance); \\n``transport documents (A6/B6); INCOTERMS® 2020\\n12\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)``export/import clearance (A7/B7); \\n``packaging (A8/B8); \\n``costs (A9/B9); and \\n``notices (A10/B10).\\n56.\\tIt is appreciated that this change in the order of the A/B \\narticles will take some time—and cost—to become familiar. It is \\nhoped that with delivery and risk now made more prominent, \\ntraders will find it easier to identify the differences among the \\nvarious Incoterms® rules, i.e. the different points in time and \\nplace at which the seller “delivers” the goods to the buyer with \\nrisk transferring to the buyer from that time and point.\\n57.\\tFor the first time, the Incoterms® rules are published both in the \\ntraditional format setting out the eleven Incoterms® rules and  \\nin a new “horizontal” format setting out the ten articles within \\neach Incoterms® rule under each of the headings listed above  \\nin paragraph 53, first for the seller and then for the buyer. \\nTraders can therefore now far more easily see the difference, \\nfor example, between the place of delivery in FCA and the \\nplace of delivery in DAP; or the items of cost which fall on  \\na buyer in CIF when compared with the items of cost which  \\nfall on a buyer in CFR. It is hoped that this “horizontal” rep-\\nresentation of the Incoterms® 2020 rules will further assist \\ntraders in choosing the Incoterms® rule most appropriate to \\ntheir commercial requirements. \\n IX. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INCOTERMS® 2010 AND 2020\\n58.\\tThe most important initiative behind the Incoterms® 2020 rules \\nhas been to focus on how the presentation could be enhanced \\nto steer users towards the right Incoterms® rule for their sale \\ncontract. Thus:\\na)\\ta greater emphasis in this Introduction on making the right \\nchoice; \\nb)\\ta clearer explanation of the demarcation and connection \\nbetween the sale contract and its ancillary contracts; \\nc)\\tupgraded Guidance Notes presented now as Explanatory \\nNotes to each Incoterms® rule; and\\nd)\\ta re-ordering within the Incoterms® rules giving delivery  \\nand risk more prominence.\\nAll these changes, though cosmetic in appearance, are in \\nreality substantial attempts on the part of ICC to assist the \\ninternational trading community towards smoother export/\\nimport transactions.\\n59.\\tApart from these general changes, there are more substantive \\nchanges in the Incoterms® 2020 rules when compared with \\nIncoterms® 2010. Before looking at those changes, mention \\nmust be made of a particular development in trade practice INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 13which occurred since 2010 and which ICC has decided should \\nnot lead to a change in the Incoterms® 2020 rules, namely \\nVerified Gross Mass (VGM).\\n60.\\tNote on Verified Gross Mass (VGM)—Since 1 July 2016, \\nRegulation 2 under the International Convention for the Safety \\nof Life at Sea (SOLAS) imposed on shippers in the case of the \\nshipment of containers the obligation either to weigh the \\npacked container using calibrated and certified equipment,  \\nor to weigh the contents of the container and add the weight \\nof the container when empty. In either case, the VGM is to be \\nrecorded with the carrier. A failure to comply bears the \\nsanction under the SOLAS Convention that the container \\n“should not be loaded onto a ship”: see paragraph 4.2,  \\nMSC1/Circ.1475, 9 June 2014.\\nThese weighing operations obviously incur expense and failure \\nmay lead to delay in loading. As this happened after 2010, it is \\nunsurprising that there was some pressure in the consultations \\nleading to Incoterms® 2020 for a clear indication to be given as \\nto who, as between seller and buyer, should bear such \\nobligations. \\n61.\\tIt was felt by the Drafting Group that obligations and costs \\nrelating to VGM were too specific and complex to warrant \\nexplicit mention in the Incoterms® 2020 rules.\\n62.\\tReturning to the changes made by ICC to the Incoterms® 2010 \\nrules in the Incoterms® 2020 rules, these are: \\n[a] Bills of lading with an on-board notation and the FCA \\nIncoterms® rule\\n[b] Costs, where they are listed\\n[c] Different levels of insurance cover in CIF and CIP \\n[d] Arranging for carriage with seller’s or buyer’s own \\nmeans of transport in FCA, DAP, DPU and DDP\\n[e] Change in the three-letter initials for DAT to DPU\\n[f] Inclusion of security-related requirements within \\ncarriage obligations and costs\\n[g] Explanatory Notes for Users\\n[a] Bills of lading with an on-board notation and the FCA \\nIncoterms® rule\\n63.\\tWhere goods are sold FCA for carriage by sea, sellers or \\nbuyers (or more likely their banks where a letter of credit is in \\nplace) might want a bill of lading with an on-board notation.\\n64.\\tHowever, delivery under the FCA rule is completed before the \\nloading of the goods on board the vessel. It is by no means \\ncertain that the seller can obtain an on-board bill of lading from \\nthe carrier. That carrier is likely, under its contract of carriage, \\nto be bound and entitled to issue an on-board bill of lading \\nonly once the goods are actually on board.INCOTERMS® 2020\\n14\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)65.\\tTo cater for this situation, FCA A6/B6 of Incoterms®  2020 now \\nprovides for an additional option. The buyer and the seller can \\nagree that the buyer will instruct its carrier to issue an on-board \\nbill of lading to the seller after the loading of the goods, the \\nseller then being obliged to tender that bill of lading to the \\nbuyer, typically through the banks. ICC recognises that, despite \\nthis somewhat unhappy union between an on-board bill of \\nlading and FCA delivery, this caters for a demonstrated need  \\nin the marketplace. Finally, it should be emphasised that even \\nwhere this optional mechanism is adopted, the seller is under \\nno obligation to the buyer as to the terms of the contract \\nof\\xa0carriage.\\n66.\\tDoes it remain true to say that where containerised goods are \\ndelivered by seller to buyer by handing over to a carrier before \\nloading onto a ship, the seller is well advised to sell on FCA \\nterms rather than on FOB terms? The answer to that question \\nis Yes. Where Incoterms®  2020 have made a difference, \\nhowever, is that where such a seller still wants or needs a bill  \\nof lading with an on-board notation, the new additional option \\nin the FCA term A6/B6 makes provision for such a document.\\n[b] Costs, where they are listed\\n67.\\tIn the new ordering of the articles within the Incoterms® 2020 \\nrules, costs now appear at A9/B9 of each Incoterms® rule. \\nApart from that re-location, however, there is another change \\nthat will become obvious to users early on. The various costs \\nwhich fall to be allocated by various articles within the Inco-\\nterms® rules have traditionally appeared in different parts of \\neach Incoterms® rule. Thus, for example, costs related to the \\nobtaining of a delivery document in FOB 2010 were mentioned \\nin A8, the article under the heading “Delivery Document”, but \\nnot in A6, the article under the heading “Allocation of Costs”. \\n68.\\tIn the Incoterms® 2020 rules, however, the equivalent of A6/B6, \\nnamely A9/B9, now lists all the costs allocated by each \\nparticular Incoterms® rule. A9/B9 in the Incoterms® 2020 rules \\nare consequently longer than A6/B6 in the Incoterms® \\n2010\\xa0rules. \\n69.\\tThe purpose is to provide users with a one-stop list of costs,  \\nso that the seller or buyer can now find in one place all the \\ncosts for which it would be responsible under that particular \\n Incoterms® rule. Items of cost are also mentioned in their home \\narticle: thus, for example, the costs involved in obtaining \\ndocuments in FOB still also appear at A6/B6 as well as at  \\nA9/B9. The thinking here was that users interested in \\ndiscovering the specific allocation of documentary costs  \\nmight be more inclined to go to the specific article dealing  \\nwith delivery documents rather than to the general article \\nlisting all the\\xa0costs. INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 15[c] Different levels of insurance cover in CIF and CIP \\n70.\\tIn the Incoterms® 2010 rules, A3 of both CIF and CIP imposed \\non the seller the obligation to “obtain at its own expense cargo \\ninsurance complying at least with the minimum cover as \\nprovided by Clauses (C) of the Institute Cargo Clauses (Lloyd’s \\nMarket Association/International Underwriting Association \\n‘LMA/IUA’) or any similar clauses.” Institute Cargo Clauses (C) \\nprovide cover for a number of listed risks, subject to itemised \\nexclusions; Institute Cargo Clauses (A), on the other hand, \\ncover “all risks”, again subject to itemised exclusions. During \\nthe consultations leading to the Incoterms® 2020 rules, the case \\nwas made for moving from Institute Cargo Clauses (C) to \\nInstitute Cargo Clauses (A), thus increasing the cover obtained \\nby the seller for the benefit of the buyer. This could, of course, \\nalso involve an additional cost in premium. The contrary case, \\nnamely to stay with Institute Cargo Clauses (C), was equally \\nstrongly put, particularly by those involved in the maritime \\ntrade of commodities. After considerable discussion within and \\nbeyond the Drafting Group, the decision was made to provide \\nfor different minimum cover in the CIF Incoterms® rule and in \\nthe CIP Incoterms® rule. In the first, which is much more likely \\nto be used in the maritime commodity trades, the status quo \\nhas been retained, with Institute Cargo Clauses (C) as the \\ndefault position, although it is, of course, open to the parties to \\nagree to higher cover. In the second, namely the CIP Incoterms® \\nrule, the seller must now obtain insurance cover complying \\nwith Institute Cargo Clauses (A), although it is, of course, again \\nopen to the parties to agree on a lower level of cover.\\n[d] Arranging for carriage with seller’s or buyer’s own means  \\nof transport in FCA, DAP, DPU and DDP\\n71.\\tIn the Incoterms® 2010 rules, it was assumed throughout that \\nwhere the goods were to be carried from the seller to the \\nbuyer, they would be carried by a third-party carrier engaged \\nfor the purpose either by the seller or the buyer, depending  \\non which Incoterms® rule was used.\\n72.\\tIt became clear in the deliberations leading to Incoterms®  2020, \\nhowever, that there were some situations where, although the \\ngoods were to be carried from the seller to the buyer, they \\ncould be so carried without any third-party carrier being \\nengaged at all. Thus, for example, there was nothing stopping \\na seller on a D rule from arranging for such carriage without \\noutsourcing that function to a third party, namely by using its \\nown means of transportation. Likewise, with an FCA purchase, \\nthere was nothing to stop the buyer from using its own vehicle \\nfor the collection of the goods and for their transport to the \\nbuyer’s premises. INCOTERMS® 2020\\n16\\u2002|\\u2002INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)73.\\tThe rules appeared not to take account of these eventualities. \\nThe Incoterms® 2020 rules now do, by expressly allowing not \\nonly for the making of a contract of carriage, but also for \\nsimply arranging for the necessary carriage.\\n[e] Change in the three-letter initials for DAT to DPU\\n74.\\tThe only difference between DAT and DAP in the Incoterms® \\n2010 rules was that in DAT the seller delivered the goods once \\nunloaded from the arriving means of transport into a “terminal”; \\nwhereas in DAP, the seller delivered the goods when the goods \\nwere placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means \\nof transport for unloading. It will also be recalled that the \\nGuidance Note for DAT in Incoterms®  2010 defined the word \\n“terminal” broadly to include “any place, whether covered \\nor\\xa0not…”. \\n75.\\tICC decided to make two changes to DAT and DAP. First, the \\norder in which the two Incoterms® 2020 rules are presented  \\nhas been inverted, and DAP, where delivery happens before \\nunloading, now appears before DAT. Secondly, the name  \\nof the rule DAT has been changed to DPU (Delivered at Place \\nUnloaded), emphasising the reality that the place of destination \\ncould be any place and not only a “terminal”. However, if that \\nplace is not in a terminal, the seller should make sure that the \\nplace where it intends to deliver the goods is a place where it is \\nable to unload the goods.\\n[f] Inclusion of security-related requirements within carriage \\nobligations and costs\\n76.\\tIt will be recalled that security-related requirements made a \\nrather subdued entry into the Incoterms® 2010 rules, through \\nA2/B2 and A10/B10 in each rule. The Incoterms® 2010 rules \\nwere the first revision of the Incoterms® rules to come into force \\nafter security-related concerns became so prevalent in the \\nearly part of this century. Those concerns, and the associated \\nshipping practices which they have created in their wake, are \\nnow much more established. Connected as they are to carriage \\nrequirements, an express allocation of security-related \\nobligations has now been added to A4 and A7 of each \\nIncoterms® rule. The costs incurred by these requirements are \\nalso now given a more prominent position in the costs article, \\nnamely A9/B9. \\n[g] Explanatory Notes for Users\\n77.\\tThe Guidance Notes appearing at the start of each Incoterms® \\nrule in the 2010 version now appear as “Explanatory Notes for \\nUsers”. These Notes explain the fundamentals of each \\n Incoterms® 2020 rule, such as when it should be used, when \\nrisk transfers and how costs are allocated between seller and \\nbuyer. The Explanatory Notes are intended (a) to help the \\nuser accurately and efficiently steer towards the appropriate INCOTERMS® 2020\\nINTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC)\\u2002|\\u2002 17Incoterms® rule for a particular transaction; and (b) to provide \\nthose deciding or advising on disputes or contracts governed \\nby Incoterms® 2020 with guidance on matters which might \\nrequire interpretation. For guidance on more fundamental \\nissues that cut across the Incoterms® 2020 rules more gener-\\nally, reference may, of course, also be made to the text of \\nthis\\xa0Introduction.\\n X. CAUTION WITH VARIANTS OF INCOTERMS® RULES\\n78.\\tSometimes the parties want to alter an Incoterms® rule. The \\nIncoterms® 2020 rules do not prohibit such alteration, but \\nthere are dangers in so doing. In order to avoid any unwel-\\ncome surprises, the parties would need to make the intended \\neffect of such alterations extremely clear in their contract. \\nThus, for example, if the allocation of costs in the Incoterms® \\n2020 rules is altered in the contract, the parties should also \\nclearly state whether they intend to vary the point at which \\ndelivery is made and the risk transfers to the buyer. \\nCharles Debattista* \\nSpecial ICC Advisor  \\nIncoterms® 2020 Drafting Group\\n36 Stone  \\nGray’s Inn  \\nLondon\\n* I am very grateful for comments received on earlier drafts of this personal \\nIntroduction to the new rules, both from ICC national committees and from my \\ncolleagues on the Drafting Group.

It is intended to provide a \\nshort introduction to the basics. Any specific questions should be referred to MANE's Legal and IP Department. \\n \\n1. What is intellectual property? \\nIntellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; \\nand symbols, names and images used in commerce. \\n \\nIP is protected in specific laws, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent \\nor create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP \\nsystem aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish. \\n \\n2. What are the common types of IP? \\nPATENTS \\nREGISTERED DESIGNS (or Design Patent) \\nTRADEMARKS \\nCOPYRIGHTS \\nTRADE SECRETS \\n \\n3. What is a patent? \\nA patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, \\na new product or way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a technical problem. \\n \\nPatents protect the features and processes that make things work. Patent rights let inventors profit from their \\ninventions. \\n \\nPatent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent \\nowner’s consent.  Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop \\npatent infringement. Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third \\nparty. \\n \\n4. What is a trademark? \\nA trademark is a distinctive sign or mark, which identifies certain goods or services as those produced or provided \\nby a specific person or enterprise. \\n \\n5. What can be registered as a trademark? \\nWords; Logos; Slogans; Sounds; Colors; Shapes; Smells. \\n \\n6. What is a Registered Design? \\nA design is the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. The design may consist of three-dimensional \\nfeatures, such as the shape or surface of an article, or of two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or \\ncolor. \\n \\n7. What is copyright? \\nCopyright is the set of exclusive rights granted to the creator of an original work (e.g. a piece of music, song \\nlyrics, films, novels, photographs, paintings, web pages) including the right to copy, distribute and adapt the \\nwork. Like all of the other IP rights, these rights can be licensed, transferred and/or assigned. \\n \\n8. What is an intellectual property licensing agreement? \\nA licensing agreement involves the transfer of intellectual property rights, and potentially proprietary knowledge, \\nin return for royalty as revenue from one company or individual to another. \\n \\n \\n \", ' \\nINVENTORSHIP \\nFrequently Asked Questions \\n \\nMANE Legal & IP Department May 12, 2021 Page 1 of 1 \\n This document of FAQs serves as a brief introduction to the concept of \"inventorship\". Any \\nspecific questions should be referred to MANE\\'s Legal and IP Department . \\n \\n1. What information is necessary to identify an inventor? \\nThe determination of inventorship is a legal conclusion based on facts.  Accordingly, \\nspecific details characterizing each contributor\\'s work on the project must be detailed in the \\nPatentability Study Request Form . \\nWhile most, if not all, patent statutes around the world fail to provide a precise definition \\nof \"inventor,\" it is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed to the conception of \\nsome aspect of the inventive  features (i.e., novel and/or non-obvious) of the invention.  \\nConception, which is the key to inventorship, may be defined as the formation in the mind of an \\ninventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is \\nthereafter put into practice.  And because inventions are defined by the claims, an inventor must \\nbe able to point to at least one element in at least one claim that (s)he conceived.  Additionally, \\nthose claim element(s) must be one of the inventive (novel or non-obvious) elements.   \\nIf requested, the project leader may be required to submit evidence of contribution for \\neach person, e.g., laboratory notebook pages or reports, showing the conception of at least one \\ninventive element of the claimed invention. \\n \\n2. My colleague and I worked together on the project, who is the inventor? \\nWhen two or more people collaborate in conceiving a claimed invention, then those \\npeople are joint inventors. Each joint inventor must be aware of the contribution of the other and \\neach must contribute to the formation of the solution to a problem that is the invention. Thus, \\njoint inventorship is the process by which people cooperate to solve a problem and in which \\neach person makes some mental contribution to the final conception of the solution. The entire \\ninventive concept need not occur to each of the joint inventors and they need not physically work \\non the project together or at the same time. Nor do their contributions need to be the same or \\nequal. All that is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the \\nclaims in the patent application.  \\nPlease note that merely being present during a meeting, providing research support, \\nsetting up experiments at the instruction of another, analytical testing, or simply instructing \\nothers to perform research does not, by itself, indicate a contribution to the conception of the \\ninvention.  \\n \\n3. Who is responsible for identifying inventors? \\nPatent Counsel at MANE bears the responsibility, in association with preparing a patent \\napplication, to identifying the inventor(s). Consequently, successfully identifying inventor(s) \\ninvolves assessing the nature of contribution by each person. This assessment is necessary to \\npermit the applicant to meet its legal obligation in most, if not all, of the national patent offices to \\nprovide to an accurate listing of inventors on a patent application.  \\nFailure to provide an accurate list of inventors may, in some circumstances, compromise \\nthe validity and enforceability of the resulting patent. Inadvertently naming or omitting an inventor \\nis generally a correctable error, but intentionally naming or omitting an inventor can result in the \\npatent being found unenforceable against alleged infringers.   \\n ', 'MANE LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY  \\n \\nMane Legal & IP Dep artment  October 27, 2017  Page 1 of 10 \\n  \\n \\n \\nOBJECT IVE:   \\n The intent of this policy is to provide clear and consistent instructions regarding \\nacceptable steps and measures  for creating a permanent  and legally -sufficient  record of \\nresearch and development activities  by MANE  group employees, contractors, interns, \\nexterns, or other persons conducting  research related activitie s on behalf of the MANE  \\ngroup . \\n \\nSCOPE OF APPLICATION:   \\n This policy specifically governs acceptable practices  relating to creation  and retention of  \\nall research and development records at MANE \\'s R&D/Innovation  Centers worldwide .  \\nThis policy , which  is based on and consistent with Procedure ITG-DS-001/08 of           \\nV.

Laboratory Notebook  \\n \\n1.1. Functions  and objectives  \\n \\nResearch and development (R&D) refers to innovative activities toward developing new \\nproducts, processes, or equipment , or improvements in  existing products, processes, or \\nequipment .  To that end, all R&D work involving new products, processes, equipment, or \\nmodification of existing products, processes, or equipment must be evaluated to assess \\nnovelty and obviousness (inventive step).  All M ane researchers, engineers, technicians, \\ntrainees, interns,  in charge of product or production process development work  shall utilize a \\ncompany -issued laboratory notebook to record any R&D  work  that foreseeably involves the \\ncreation of new, nonobvious, and commercially relevant products, processes, or equipment.  \\n \\nThe primary purpose of a laboratory notebook is to preserve and protect i ntellectu al \\nproperty rights in all  new and improved products, proc esses, or equipment  by serving as a \\nrecord and archive for all research and development work (ideas, experiments, formulations, \\netc.).  A laboratory notebook , when properly utilized , may be used as legal evidence  with \\nrespec t to various aspects of the new or improved methods/products , such as conception \\nand/or reduction to practice of an invention and date (s) corresponding thereto,  test results , \\nand the like .   \\n \\nIn this respect, laboratory notebooks  enable  inventors : \\n\\uf0a7 To record and provide an accounting  of the intellectual and technical progress \\ncorrespond ing to each project carried out;  \\n\\uf0a7 To explain the manner in which  an experiment was carried out and how the result(s) \\nof that experiment was obtained, and thus serve as the definitive account of what \\ntranspired, which  thereby ensure s the rep roducibility of the experiment ; and  \\n\\uf0a7 To ensure the preservation of information  which  may be useful  for both internal and \\nexternal communications  (e.g., writing scientific publications, preparing \\npresentations, drafting o f patent applications, transfer of technology, etc.).  \\n \\nBy following the steps prescribed herein  for their implementation, MANE  laboratory \\nnotebooks  will possess the  authenticity to serve as  evidentiary tools  in the event of  \\nlitigation (s), dispute (s), or claim (s).  Proper implementation of the prescribed  procedure will \\ncreate laboratory notebooks that can be used : \\n\\uf0a7 To certify that , on a specified date, the holder  possessed the information contained \\ntherein  (e.g., experimental results, scientific observation, working hypotheses , etc.);  \\n\\uf0a7 To specifically define  the information created by the holder, such as  working \\nhypothesis, reflection s, experimental  designs and results, which may assist with \\ndetermining  inventorship, establishing invention rights , and providing data for patent \\nfilings ; and  \\n\\uf0a7 To provide  a factual accounting toward the degree of participation (e.g., intellectual \\nand material contribution ) of an individual and/or a compan y in the design of an \\ninvention . \\n \\nAccordingly, a properly documented laboratory notebook  make s it possible to capitalize \\non the knowledge and know -how of researchers / laboratories / companies.  As such, they are \\nan essential component of the heritage of V.

Each laboratory notebook shall have a unique \\nalphanumerical identifier assigned  (further discussed below) , either embossed on the exterior \\ncovering  or marked in permanent ink on the interior cover .   \\n \\nA supply of l aboratory  books should be maintained  by the Director or Vice President  \\n(VP)  of R&D of the respective R&D/ Innovati on site .  Each person(s) assigned to a given \\nnotebook is responsible for the safe keeping, maintenance , and archiving  thereof.  \\n \\n1.3. Attribution and classification  \\n \\nThe VP of R&D or Director of the Mane R&D/Innovation site  is responsible for creating  \\nand maintain ing a Laboratory Notebook Log  for recording the assignment of laboratory \\nnotebooks to personnel.   The assignment of each  laboratory note book  is entered into the \\nLaboratory Notebook Log by associating the laboratory notebook\\'s unique al phanumerical \\nidentifier with at least one  individual , who is responsible for its maintenance  and safekeeping . \\n \\nA laboratory notebook \\'s unique alphanumerical identifier shall comprise  a mixture of \\nletters and numbers .  Letters are used  to designate the MANE group company  (e.g., MINC \\nfor Mane, Inc. in USA; MSEA for Mane Sea in Singapore ; KCOR for KANCOR \\nINGREDIENT S LIMITED  in India etc… ).  For  the numerical portion of the identifier, at \\nleast three digits  should  correspond to the sequence number of opening of the laboratory \\nnotebook , and two digits correspond ing to the year of assignment should be set apart from the \\nprevious digits with a forwar d slash (/) (ex: MUSA -001/17 , MMEX -014/17 , PTMI -008/17, \\netc.). \\n \\nThe unique alphanumerical identifier  may be  embossed on the note book \\'s exterior and/or \\nrecorded in permanent ink inside the front cover .  Further, this unique alphanumerical \\nidentifier should be entered  on the first page  of experiments , and on all subsequent  pages that \\nbegin a new program, a new test , new experiment, etc.  \\n \\nOn the  inside cover of the laboratory notebook, the following information must be \\nentered : \\n\\uf0a7 The exact  (legal entity)  Company Name (e.g., PT MANE INDONESIA ). \\n\\uf0a7 The section  (department)  information (e.g., Flavors, Applications, etc.) . \\n\\uf0a7 The control number  (i.e., the unique identifier assigned to that book) . \\n\\uf0a7 The name of the person  to wh om the lab oratory  notebook  has been assigned . \\n\\uf0a7 Signature of the person , which acknowledges the receipt thereof.  \\n\\uf0a7 The date of  issuance . \\n\\uf0a7 The date of the last entry . \\n\\uf0a7 The control number of the previously used laboratory notebook , if applicable.  \\n\\uf0a7 The control number of the next used laborat ory notebook , if applicable.  \\n\\uf0a7 The name of the person who assigned the notebook . \\n\\uf0a7 The total number of pages of data entered . \\n \\n Additionally, inside the front and back covers shall be place d a stamp specifying t he MANE LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY  \\n \\nMane Legal & IP Dep artment  October 27, 2017  Page 4 of 10 \\n ownership of the laboratory notebook, by speci fically identifying  the name of the MANE \\ngroup subsidiary/affiliate and its contact information (e.g., address, telephone  and fax  \\nnumbers ). \\n \\nNote 1: Example:  \\n \\nThis laboratory notebook  is the exclusive property of the company:  \\nMane, Inc., a subsidiary of V.

If necessary, at the time of the opening of this lab \\nnotebook , one person  (e.g., a supervisor ) is designated  as the assignee, where t he first \\npage is filled out with info rmation which corresponds to this person .  Each contributor  \\n(intern or trainee)  making entries into the laboratory notebook  must be identified .  A \\nlisting of the contributors, along with their respective handwritten signatures, needs to be \\nprepared on the page following the LABORATORY RECORDKEEPING PROCEDURES \\nnear the front of the laboratory notebook.  \\n \\nThe operating instructions for making entries into  the laboratory  notebook , which are  \\nprinted at the  beginning p ages of the laboratory notebook, as well as reproduced at the end of \\nthis policy , must be known to every contributor  writing entries into a laboratory notebook .  \\nBy signing, each contributor to the laboratory notebook  attests to  having read these \\ninstructions , and agrees  to comply with the rules and principles defined  therein . \\n \\n1.4. Property and confidentiality  \\n \\nThe laboratory notebooks  and their contents remain, in all circumstances, the exclusive \\nproperty of  the MANE group .

General R ules Regarding  Form \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Preferably, t he language of the lab oratory note book is English , but French or \\nSpanish may be acceptable alternatives depending on the location of the Mane \\nInnovation center . \\n\\uf0a7 The information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet, dated ( using two \\ndigits for the day, at least three letters to uniquely identify the month , and four \\ndigits for the year, e.g., 20 MAY 2017  or 05 NOV 2017 ), and referen ced with its  \\ncompany project  name or  number and/ or an internal reference specific to the \\nresearcher . \\n\\uf0a7 The recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed \\nlines of the pages of the notebook, respecting the full width of the pages.  \\n\\uf0a7 The insertion  of information near the internal margin is to be avoided, as \\ninformation may be difficult to capture accurately during scanning . \\n \\nNote 3 : If the need for a later entry or amendment arises, it is  advisable to use unmarked  \\nsection  of the page  immediately below, and particularly point  out the passage (s) \\nconcerned.  Where no such unmarked section  is available, one should make the \\nentry/amendment on a subsequent page , and record the subsequent page number on the \\ninstant page.  An arrow, asterisk , etc. can be used to precisely identify the section being \\namended or corrected . \\n \\n Record ing data can also be carried out by means of inserting  preprinted information  in the  \\nnotebook (for example, typed reports, diagrams, diagrams, output datum of equipment of \\nanalysis, photographs, etc.).  The preprinted information should  not exceed the dimensions of \\nthe page, nor cover any information already entered on the page. Transparent tape or other \\nadhesive should be utilized to affix the insert ed information  to the  page surface.  \\n \\n For t wo successive inserts , the second must be affixed  below the other (or on two \\nsuccessive pages) and not side by side.   Each  taped or glued insert  must be signed and dated \\nby both the writer  and the witness (each signature should  traverse at least one of the seams \\nbetween the insert  and the support page).   Other than the aforementioned dates and \\nsignatures, no other handw ritten annotations on the insert are permitted .   \\n \\nNote  4: If there is a need to annotate information on an ins ert (e.g., for reasons of \\nclarity), the \"original\" preprinted copy  must be annotated  first and  then photocopied; the \\ncorresponding photocopy is then adhered to the surface of the note book  page . \\n \\nNote  5: It is not necessary to integrate every piece of data  in the laboratory notebook . \\nFor example, if the data set is too large, the writer can also create alternative archives \\nfor the data ( e.g., an electronic database of HPLC chromatographs) , and simply \\nreference the corresponding file number . \\n \\nNote  6: Rather than the original of an experimental material, a photograph or a digitized \\nreproduction may be used, such as in the case of a thin -layer chromatography plate, a \\ngel, a membrane , an autoradiography , or a thermosensitive ticket.  \\n MANE LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY  \\n \\nMane Legal & IP Dep artment  October 27, 2017  Page 6 of 10 \\n Significant blank s paces between two information entries (for example, successions of \\nblank lines, page breaks, pages left blank) or to the right of an insert, mus t be crossed out by \\nmeans of a \"Z\", so that no information may be  subsequently added .  The removal of any \\nlabora tory noteb ook page is strictly prohibited, as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of the \\nentire notebook . \\n \\nAll handwritten entries shall  be made using permanent  ink.  There is no restriction on the \\nchoice of ink colors to be used, provided that the recorded information remains fully legible \\nand comprehensible in full, after black and white reproduction using a standard photocopier.   \\nBlack or dark blue inks are recommend ed.  The use of erasable ink, pencil , or \"white \\ncorrection fluid\" is not allowed.  The texts and entries must be legible (any erasure must be \\nreferred to and dated, both by the editor and the witness).  \\n \\nAny coding of information using specific colors shoul d be avoided.  If the use of colors \\ncannot be avoi ded, the selection of colors and/ or textures must be made with careful \\nconsideration  of a possible need for subsequent reproduction  using a  standard photocopier  in \\nblack and white . \\n \\nOn each page containing an entry , the name of the project and  laboratory notebook \\nnumber must be entered in the designated location at the top of  the page.  \\n \\n2.2. General R ules Regarding S ubstance  \\n \\nEach test, experiment, or analysis , whether positive or negative, must be recorded in the \\nlaboratory record.  Care should be taken to ensure that the following elements are clearly and \\nprecisely stated:  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 The context in which the work was carr ied out, the objectives set and/ or the \\nproblem to be so lved, the working hypotheses, etc.;  \\n\\uf0a7 The experimental conditions used (protocols, particular pa rameters and material \\nused ...);  and \\n\\uf0a7 The results obtained, their possible interpretation, as well as any ideas, reflectio ns \\nor comments relating thereto.  \\n \\nNote 7 :  If a protocol has already been previously described, in the sa me or different \\nlaboratory notebook, it is not necessary to reproduce the  entire information for a new \\nentry.  Rather, it is sufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with \\nparticularity, i.e., the laboratory notebook numb er and page(s) concerned  along with the \\nname of its author .  All modification s, changes, or adaptations to the referenced \\ninformation must be sufficiently described .  Referencing  scientific  publications or books is \\npermiss ible if identified  unambi guously  using a full bibliographical citation . \\n \\nAbbreviations may be used.  However, abbreviations that are non-standard to person s \\nhaving ordinary skill in the relevant field m ust be defined at their first appearance .  Further, \\nabbreviations , along with their definition , should also be recorded after the table of \\ncontents/index section at the front of the laboratory notebook . \\n \\nNote 8 :  It is possible to create a  separate  laboratory notebook  specifically  reserved  for \\nrecording standard laborato ry or testing procedures and protocols, abbreviations, etc., and \\nthen make  an appropriate  reference to this separate laboratory notebook .  MANE LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY  \\n \\nMane Legal & IP Dep artment  October 27, 2017  Page 7 of 10 \\n 2.3. Require d Duties of Author and Witness  \\n \\nEach laboratory notebook must be regularly submitted to a witness review process. \\nWitnesses are Mane employees having the ability or background to understand the invention. \\nFor example, if the invention involves advanced chemical or electronic concepts, the witness \\nmust possess adequate background in the releva nt field.  If called upon later, the witness must \\nbe able to testify to their own knowledge that the facts of the entry are correct.  However, the \\nwitness must not have the status of co -author (joint researcher) of the recorded information, \\nnor should the witness be able to be considered as co -inventor of any invention resulting from \\nall or part of the experimental information.  Accordingly, the witness should not be a \\ncollaborator on the same/similar projects as the drafter. Preferably, the witness will be  chosen \\nfrom another team or department.  \\n \\na. Duties of the author:  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Each page  must be dated.  \\n\\uf0a7 Each page of the laboratory book, as soon as it is completed, must be dated \\nand signed by the author , in the  space designat ed for this purpose.  \\n\\uf0a7 Any mistakes or crossed -out entries , as soon as they appear in the laboratory \\nbook, mu st be dated and signed by the author . \\n\\uf0a7 Do not  insert  any information (including correction s) in a corner of a page \\n(even if that page has not yet been countersigned  by a witness).  \\n\\uf0a7 If any  error  or mistake is  identified , the erroneous  informa tion should be \\nclearly identified and corrected in a space immediately below the error.  If \\nthere is no available space or the available space is insufficient, then \\ncorrections may be made on a subseque nt page (with an appropriate forward \\nreference on the page bearing the erroneous information ).  If the  date on which \\nthe error was found and/or corrected is different from the origin date, said \\ncorrection d ate should be properly recorded .  \\n\\uf0a7 Unused lines or space at the bottom of the page should be crossed out using a \\n\"Z\" marking.  \\n\\uf0a7 In order to certify the reality of the recording, the author  must have a witness \\nsign each of the pages of his laboratory notebook within a maximum of 4 \\nweeks after the writing of e ach of these pages.  \\n\\uf0a7 No new information or data integration can be entered  onto any page that has \\nbeen already signed by a witness.  \\n \\nb. Duties of the witness : \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Read the information entered by the author/researcher  to evaluate whether the \\nlevel of detail is sufficient to enable its reproduction by another having \\nordinary skill in the relevant art .  \\n\\uf0a7 Co-sign all taped or glued inserts.  The date and signature must be affixed \\nastride the insert and its supporting page surface.  \\n\\uf0a7 Verify the quality  of the information with regard to compliance with Mane\\' s \\nLaboratory Notebook Policy, along with laboratory recordkeeping procedures \\nfound at the front of the laboratory notebook itself .  \\n \\n \\n MANE LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY  \\n \\nMane Legal & IP Dep artment  October 27, 2017  Page 8 of 10 \\n By the words \" READ AND UNDERSTOOD \", the witness att ests that  his/her  duties have \\nbeen performed and then  affixes his/her signature  in the adjacent space reserved for that \\npurpose .  By this signature, the witness does not express agreement with respect to its \\ntechnical content.  The witness shall not be  responsible for any errors or inaccuracies in the \\nrecorded technical data and information that may be subsequently noted.      \\n \\nShould the witness deem  the information  insufficient  for understanding,  or finds error (s) \\nwith the form or manner of recording the information in the laboratory notebook , the witness \\nshall inform the author .  Corrective measures must be taken by the author (or supervisor) to \\naddress the insufficiency or error(s) .  After clarification/correction,  the witness may  complete \\nhis/her duties  by applying the witness  signature  and date on  the page . \\n \\nThe witness may  only review  pages  that have been filled  in their entirety .  Accordingly, \\nunused lines or space above the signature blocks need to be properly addressed by the author  \\n(possibly with o ne or more \"Z\" marks to mark spaces left empty).  \\n \\n3. Certification  \\n \\nThe holder /assignee  of a laboratory notebook must have it certif ied, twice a year at the \\ntime of certification sessions organized in May and November , by a member of Mane\\'s Legal \\nand IP Department .  All laboratory notebook s, in progress or completed , must be submitted to \\nthe Legal and IP Department  on the working day immediately  preceding the certification  \\ndate. Prior to this submission, the holder of a laboratory notebook must ensure tha t the \\ninformation in each laboratory noteboo k is correctly recorded, including marking out any \\nsignificant empty space (e.g., marked out with a  \"Z\"), updating the table of contents, as well \\nas arranging for the proper witnessing of the notebook . \\n \\nDuring certificat ion, each laboratory notebook shall be  inspected with regard to \\ncompliance with this policy.  A t the end of this inspection,  the reviewer will make an entry \\ninto the laboratory notebook and notate the completed inspection by affixing the reviewer\\'s  \\nstamp, date, and signature.   At the end of each certification, the notebook will be promptly \\nreturned to its assignee , ideally no later than  the next working day after  certification.  \\n \\nFor remote Innovation sites without a local or regional representative from MANE’s \\nLegal and IP Department,  arrangements will be made based on the volume of laboratory \\nnotebooks to enable completion of the cer tification process  without undue expense of time or \\nresources . \\n \\n4. Archiving  \\n \\nEach person a ssigned to a laboratory  notebook is responsible for the  maintenance of the \\nnotebook while it is in his/her possession .  The assigned person  (or holder) must ensure that \\neach assigned laboratory book (s) is  stored  in a safe and secure location  to prevent loss, theft , \\nor degradation.  If a laboratory notebook is lost, stolen, or damaged, the assigned person shall \\nimmediat ely notify his/her supervisor .  The holder and supervisor shall immediately prepare a \\nreport detailing the circumstances leading to the loss, theft, or degradation, an d the completed \\nreport is to be submitted to the Legal and IP Department for review and investigation . \\n \\nPrior to preserving an electronic copy of a laboratory notebook, the holder must ensure MANE LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY  \\n \\nMane Legal & IP Dep artment  October 27, 2017  Page 9 of 10 \\n that 1) the content of the notebook meet s the standards set fort h in this policy , and 2) the \\nnotebook is certified (per Section 3 above).   Once a notebook is complete and certified, the \\nholder should make arrangements with the VP of R&D to begin the laboratory notebook \\nscanning/archiving process.  After securing an ele ctronic archival copy of the laboratory \\nnotebook, the original hardcopy will be returned to its originally assigned holder for a \\nreasonable period, which shall not exceed three (3) years from the date of last entry .   \\n \\nAfter  the reasonable retention period , the original hardcopy of the laboratory notebook \\nwill be turned in to the VP of R&D  (or site Director) , who will arrange for long term storage \\nof the notebook  within a fire resistant container at the local Mane Innovation site, such as a \\nfire resistant s afe utilized by Accounting or Human Resource departments .   \\n Appendix:    Laboratory Recordkeeping Procedures  \\n \\nMane Legal & IP Dep artmen t  October 27, 2017  Page 10 of 10 \\n \\nGeneral Instruction  \\nLaboratory Notebooks are the means for keeping a permanent record of the details of an individual\\'s day -to-day \\nwork in the research and development areas.  They provide 1) a basic reference which the individual and others \\ncan refer to at a later date; 2) legal evidence with respect to the materials recorded, such as conception of an \\ninvention and date thereof or date of  reduction to practice and test results; and 3) in some instances, compliance \\nwith the provisions of many contractual arrangements.  \\nInstructions for Recording Data in the Laboratory Notebook  \\n1. All entries should be made in a legible and orderly manner usi ng permanent ink, preferably black.  Make entries \\nclear and complete, that someone else could repeat the experiment.  \\n2. Avoid erasures.  If an error is made, cross it out and make the correction immediately thereafter.  Cancellations \\nor insertions should be i nitialed, dated, and explained by an appropriate notation.  \\n3. Make sure control page is filled out prior to usage.  \\n4. Complete the table of contents as you make entries in the notebook.  \\n5. State the object and results of each experiment clearly and concisely.  Give  a complete, factual, and self -\\nexplanatory account of the progress of the work and the procedure followed (reference to earlier work done by \\nyourself or another may be accomplished by noting a previous page of the same notebook or the page and \\nnumber of an  earlier notebook).  Describe and give quantities of all materials used.  Explain all code numbers \\nand abbreviations.  \\n6. An entry dealing with a conception (invention, idea) must describe the thing conceived.  (Example, whether it is \\na chemical compound , a co mbination of a compound and a solvent, etc.) as well as the utility for the ting \\nconceived, how it is to be used and the method(s) by which it is to be prepared, including equivalent materials \\nwhich could be used.  Statements with regard to utility should be stated positively.  Work toward practical \\nimplementation of an invention should start as soon as possible in a notebook.  \\n7. Negative or deprecatory entries should be avoided.  (Example:  A reaction gives a 2% yield was expected.  Do \\nnot state \"Process does  not work\".)  Phraseology which expresses an opinion rather than a positive statement \\nand gratuitous comments should be avoided.  This is not an instruction to omit the conclusion of an experiment \\nwhich had less than the expected results.  Be factual.  \\n8. Each  day\\'s work should, whenever possible, be started on a separate page with lines drawn down angularly \\nacross the unused portion of the previous page. (This gives legal evidence that additions were not made at a later \\ndate.)  It is permissible, as stated abo ve, to make reference to an earlier page by reciting \"Continued from page \\n…\".  It is extremely important that each page show the date of entry.  \\n9. Each page must be signed and dated by the individual who makes the entry and does the work.  In addition, each \\npage must be witnessed (signed and dated), using the notation \"Read and Understood\", preferably on the same \\nday, but at least within one week.  The witness should not be connected with the conception, should not have \\ntaken part in the experimental work per formed by another, but should understand the technical filed of the entry.  \\nRecord Laboratory Notebook Number and project on each page.  \\n10. Where a conception is made by two or more individuals, it need only be entered in the notebook of one, but \\nmust be signe d and dated by all the conceivers.  Ideally, all conceivers should sign on the same day.  \\n11. For microfilming purposes, graphs, charts, analytical data, etc. must be attached to the notebook pages with a \\npermanent adhesive and should, when unfolded, be kept wi thin the confines of the opened notebook. NO \\nENTRIES SHOULD BE MADE ON THE PAGE BENEATH ATTACHED SHEETS AND NOTHING MUST \\nBE OBSCURED.  Leave the heading on the top and the space provided for the witnessing signature at the \\nbottom of each page exposed.  Ins erts should be signed and dated by the person making the entry and witnessed \\nby another to provide the best legal evidence.  If materials such as spectra, graphs, etc. are not kept in the \\nnotebook, they must be signed, dated and identified in such a manner  as to provide a reference back to the \\npertinent page(s) of the Laboratory Notebook itself.  \\n12. Report the loss or theft of a research notebook.  \\n13. Following the use of all the pages of each notebook, it must be sent to the Library for record maintenance.  \\nMake s ure table of contents pages are complete.  After it has been recorded it will be returned to the individual.  \\nAn individual may retain in his possession the Laboratory Notebook immediately preceding the one in which  \\nentries are currently being made.  Norma lly, all other Laboratory Notebooks will be kept on file in the Library \\nor in vault storage.  They may then be checked out for reasonable lengths of time by authorized individuals.  \\n \\nInstructions read and included/understood by:  \\nDate:  \\nSignature:  ', 'PATENTING PROCESS \\nFrequently Asked Questions \\n \\n \\nMANE Legal & IP Department 2 February 2021 Page 1 of 3 \\n This document of FAQs serves as a brief introduction to the basic process for securing \\npatent rights. It is intended to provide only a short introduction to the patenting process at \\nMANE.  Any specific questions should be referred to MANE\\'s Legal and IP Department . \\n \\nFor more general information on patents and patent rights, see our general FAQ: \\nhttps://mosscorp.emea.sesam.mane.com/LegalIP/IP/Patents%20useful%20information/\\nFAQs . \\n \\n1. How is a patent application created? \\nAt MANE, the patenting process begins with obtaining approval for a Patentability Study \\nfrom one of the following committees: \\nComInnov  - Innovation, Valorization and Transfer Committee - SP-DG-001/01 \\nComSci - Conception, Development and Industrialization Committee ‐ SP‐DS‐001/04 \\n \\n2. What information is necessary for initiating a patentability study? \\nThe purpose of a patentability study is to assess the likelihood of obtaining a granted \\npatent having meaningful protection.  Thus, in order to assess patentability of a new \\nproduct or process, the inventors/contributors must provide patent counsel with specific \\ndetails of the product or process, including an explanation of the technical problem being \\nsolved, successful and unsuccessful experiments, known prior art, and how the new \\nproduct or process is different from old or known products or processes. \\n \\nAfter studying the provided details, the new product or process is defined by one or more \\nhypothetical claims, which are then evaluated by comparing the hypothetical claim(s) to \\nthe prior art.  Prior art is any evidence (information) that the invention was already publicly \\nknown or available, in whole or in part, before the effective filing date of the patent \\napplication, and includes publicly available information, such as published patent \\ndocuments, scientific journal articles, web pages, technical data sheets, etc.    \\n \\n3. What happens after a patentability study? \\nAt the conclusion of the patentability study, patent counsel will prepare a final written \\npatentability report, which shall include a description of the invention, the hypothetical \\nclaim(s), a listing of the relevant prior art document(s) found in the prior art search, and \\nan analysis as to the novelty and inventiveness of the hypothetical claim(s) vis-à-vis the \\nrelevant prior art document(s).  The report will conclude with a recommendation to \\nproceed (or not) with the preparation and filing of patent application.   \\n \\nBecause the patenting system requires disclosure of the technical details of the invention \\nin exchange for a chance at obtaining patent rights, there is a risk of disclosure without \\nany patent rights.  As such, in some instances and prior to making a favorable \\nrecommendation, R&D may be asked to perform additional testing or experiments to \\nenhance MANE\\'s chances for obtaining a granted patent.  \\n \\n4. What is involved with preparing a patent application? \\nThe process for preparing a patent application involves a collaboration between patent \\ncounsel and the inventor(s).  Patent counsel will generally begin the process by preparing PATENTING PROCESS \\nFrequently Asked Questions \\n \\n \\nMANE Legal & IP Department 2 February 2021 Page 2 of 3 \\n a set of claims describing the metes and bounds of the invention, and then build the \\nremaining sections of the patent application therefrom to provide the requisite antecedent \\nbasis for the claims.  In order to correct any errors and/or provide missing or supplemental \\ninformation, the initial draft application must be reviewed by the inventors. While rare at \\nthis stage, R&D may be asked to perform additional experiments, but only if absolutely \\nnecessary prior to filing.  At the end of the review/revision process, a final draft of the \\npatent application must be approved by the inventor(s) prior to filing.  \\n \\nSince the draft patent application needs to be approved by the inventor(s), another \\nimportant piece of information that should accompany the invention disclosure is a listing \\nof persons who materially contributed to the creation of the invention.  From the listing of \\ncontributors, MANE patent counsel will conduct an inquiry into the nature of each \\ncontributor\\'s involvement and make a legal determination as to whose contribution rises \\nto the level of \"inventorship.\"  It is globally accepted that an inventor must have contributed \\nto the conception of some aspect of the inventive features (i.e., novel and/or non-obvious) \\nof the invention.  Conception, which is the key to inventorship, may be defined as the \\nformation in the mind of an inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and \\noperative invention as it is thereafter put into practice.  And because inventions are \\ndefined by the claims, an inventor must be able to point to at least one element in at least \\none claim that (s)he conceived.  Additionally, those claim element(s) must be one of the \\ninventive elements.   \\n \\nTo be co-inventors, the contributions of each person need not be equal or the same.  All \\nthat is required is collaboration and contribution to the conception of at least one of the \\nclaims in the patent application.  Please note that being present during a meeting, \\nproviding research support, setting up experiments at the instruction of another, or \\nsensory/analytical testing, does not by itself indicate a contribution to the conception of \\nthe invention. \\n \\n5. What parts make up a patent application?  \\nSince a patent application serves to provide a written description describing and enabling \\nothers to practice and use the invention, the inventors must provide patent counsel with \\nsufficient details to create the application.  The detailed invention disclosure provided to \\npatent counsel will be used to create the basic parts (sections) of a patent application, \\nwhich include Title, Abstract, Background, Summary of the Invention, Brief \\nDescription of the Drawings (if applicable), Detailed Description of the Invention, \\nand the Claims.   \\n   \\n6. Where is the initial patent application filed? \\nThe initial filing (or so-called \"priority filing\") is typically performed where the invention is \\nmade.  \\n \\n7. What happens after a patent application is filed? \\nThe filing of a patent application is not the end of the process, but really the beginning of \\na formal examination process.  Moreover, it is necessary to make decisions regarding the \\nfiling of one or more foreign patent applications. PATENTING PROCESS \\nFrequently Asked Questions \\n \\n \\nMANE Legal & IP Department 2 February 2021 Page 3 of 3 \\n  \\nUnder the Paris Convention (an international treaty created in 1883 requiring member \\ncountries to adopt certain minimum protections for industrial property), the priority filing \\npermits the applicant to file one or more corresponding patent application in additional \\ncountries, within 12 months from the priority filing date.   \\n \\nUnder the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which is another international treaty \\nconcluded in 1970, a single filing of a PCT application may be made with a Receiving \\nOffice (RO) in one language.  A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a \\npatent, since there is no such thing as an \"international patent.\"  Instead, a PCT \\napplication serves to establish a filing date in all contracting states, and must be followed \\nup one or more national or regional phase applications to proceed towards grant of one \\nor more patents. The PCT procedure essentially leads to a standard national or regional \\npatent application, which may be granted or rejected according to applicable law, in each \\njurisdiction in which a patent is desired.  If a PCT application is desired, then it must be \\nfiled within 12 months from the priority filing date, i.e., the same deadline under the Paris \\nConvention. However, the deadline for filing National Phase applications from the PCT \\napplication varies from member states, but is generally 30 months from the priority filing \\ndate.  So, in essence, the PCT serves as a mechanism to delay the decision for filing \\npatent applications from 12 months to about 30 months, but only in the 153 member \\ncountries. \\n \\nIn each jurisdiction, the claims of the patent application are evaluated for clarity, novelty, \\nand inventiveness.  \\n \\nAfter 18 months from the earliest priority date, the application publishes and thus the \\ninvention is available to the public. \\n \\n8. What to expect during examination of a patent application? \\nThe examination of a patent application begins with an examiner reviewing the clarity, \\nnovelty, and inventiveness of the claims vis-à-vis the prior art.  The examiner then issues \\nan office action, which in most cases includes a rejection/objection of one or more of the \\npending claims.  An applicant is given a limited period of time (e.g., 3-4 months) to \\nrespond to the office action, which may include arguments, claim amendments, and/or \\nevidence supporting the patentability of the pending claims. \\n \\nDepending on the nature of the rejection/objection, the inventor(s) may be consulted for \\ntechnical input to assist patent counsel with developing claim amendments/rebuttal \\narguments to overcome the examiner\\'s rejection(s)/objection(s). Ideally, the inventor(s) \\nshould also be aware of what embodiments are being utilized in MANE\\'s commercial \\nproduct/process.  Thus, this collaboration between patent counsel and the inventor(s) \\nshould provide MANE the best opportunity to obtain commercially-relevant granted \\npatents. \\n \\n ', \"PATENTS \\nFrequently Asked Questions \\nMane Legal & IP Department June 19 2020    Page 1 of 1   \\nThis document of FAQs serves as a brief introduction to patent rights. It is intended to provide a short introduction to the \\nbasics. Any specific questions should be referred to MANE's Legal and IP Department. \\n \\n1. What is a patent? \\nA patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new way \\nof doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. A few exemplary inventions include 1) a new process \\nfor making seamless capsules, 2) a new fragrance molecule, or 3) a new composition that blocks bitterness taste of high \\nintensity sweeteners. \\n \\nPatent protection means an invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner’s \\nconsent. Patent rights are usually enforced in courts that, in most systems, hold the authority to stop patent infringement. \\nConversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party. \\n \\n2. What is patentable? \\nAn invention must, in general, fulfill the following conditions to be protected by a patent.  \\n1. Industrially applicable (useful): It must be of practical use. \\n2. New: It must show an element of “novelty”, meaning some new characteristic that is not part of the body of existing \\nknowledge in its particular technical field. That body of existing knowledge is called “prior art”.  \\n3. Inventive (not obvious):  It must show an “inventive step” that is not obvious or routine by a person with average \\nknowledge of the technical field.  \\n \\nThe subject matter of the invention must also be accepted as “patentable” under the patent laws of a given county. In many \\ncountries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, \\ncommercial methods or methods of medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) are not generally patentable. For \\nexample abstract ideas (Einstein's equation E=mc2), laws of nature (gravity), or natural occurring phenomena (a chemical \\nfound in nature) are not patentable, but specific applications of these things could be patentable. \\n \\n3. How long does a patent last? \\nPatent rights may last for up to 20 years, IF renewal or maintenance fees are paid in a timely manner. \\n \\n4. Which countries are covered by a patent?  \\nPatents are granted by national patent offices or by regional offices that carry out examination work for a group of countries \\n– for example, the European Patent Office (EPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). Under such \\nregional systems, an applicant requests protection for an invention in one or more countries, and each country decides \\nwhether to offer patent protection within its borders.  \\n \\nThe WIPO-administered Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides for the filing of a single international patent application \\nthat has the same effect as national applications filed in the designated countries. However, in order to obtain a patent in a \\nPCT member nation, a patent application must be filed and prosecuted in the PCT member nation. \\n \\n5. What is patent infringement?  \\nPatent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the \\npatent holder. Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license. The definition of patent infringement may vary \\nby jurisdiction, but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention. In many countries, a use is required to be \\ncommercial (or to have a commercial purpose) to constitute patent infringement. The scope of the patented invention or the \\nextent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. In other words, the terms of the claims inform the public \\nof what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder. \\n \\nPatents are territorial, and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force. \\n \\n \\n6.

General Rules Regarding Form\\n\\uf076Preferably, the language of the laboratory notebook is English, but French or Spanish may be \\nacceptable alternatives depending on the location of the Mane Innovation center.\\n\\uf076The information is recorded directly in the laboratory booklet, dated (using two digits for the \\nday, at least three letters to uniquely identify the month , and four digits for the year, e.g., 20 \\nMAY 2017 or 05 NOV 2017), and referenced with its company project name or number \\nand/or an internal reference specific to the researcher.\\n\\uf076The recording of handwritten information is done directly and only on the printed lines of the \\npages of the notebook, respecting the full width of the pages.\\n\\uf076The insertion of information near the internal margin is to be avoided, as information may be \\ndifficult to capture accurately during scanning.\\nNote 3: If the need for a later entry or amendment arises, it is advisable to use unmarked section of the page \\nimmediately below, and particularly point out the passage(s) concerned. Where no such unmarked \\nsection is available, one should make the entry/amendment on a subsequent page, and record the \\nsubsequent page number on the instant page. An arrow, asterisk, etc. can be used to precisely \\nidentify the section being amended or corrected.11GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017NOTEBOOK AND METHODS \\n\\uf076Recording data can also be carried out by means of inserting preprinted information in the \\nnotebook (for example, typed reports, diagrams, diagrams, output datum of equipment of \\nanalysis, photographs, etc.). The preprinted information should not exceed the dimensions of \\nthe page, nor cover any information already entered on the page. Transparent tape or \\nother adhesive should be utilized to affix the inserted information to the page surface.\\n\\uf076For two successive inserts, the second must be affixed below the other (or on two successive \\npages) and not side by side. Each taped or glued insert must be signed and dated by both \\nthe writer and the witness (each signature should traverse at least one of the seams between \\nthe insert and the support page). Other than the aforementioned dates and signatures, no \\nother handwritten annotations on the insert are permitted.\\nNote 4: If there is a need to annotate information on an insert (e.g., for reasons of clarity), the \"original\" \\npreprinted copy must be annotated first and then photocopied; the corresponding photocopy is then \\nadhered to the surface of the notebook page.\\nNote 5: It is not necessary to integrate every piece of data in the laboratory notebook. For example, if the \\ndata set is too large, the writer can also create alternative archives for the data (e.g., an electronic \\ndatabase of HPLC chromatographs), and simply reference the corresponding file number.\\nNote 6: Rather than the original of an experimental material, a photograph or a digitized reproduction may \\nbe used, such as in the case of a thin-layer chromatography plate, a gel, a membrane, an \\nautoradiography, or a thermosensitive ticket.12GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017NOTEBOOK AND METHODS \\nSupplemental Materials \\n\\uf076Examples of information that could be inserted (taped) into a notebook: \\n\\uf076Computer-generated data \\n\\uf076Datasheet templates \\n\\uf076E-mails\\n\\uf076Notes of discussions and conversations \\n\\uf076Photographs \\n\\uf076Printed graphs \\n\\uf076Product labels \\n\\uf076Related papers and readings \\n\\uf076If too large to fit, items may be kept in a separate folder Always record date \\nand other identifying information \\n\\uf076Provide “links” to equipment logbooks, data on computers, other notebooks, \\njournal references, etc13GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017NOTEBOOK AND METHODS \\n\\uf076Significant blank spaces between two information entries (for example, successions of blank \\nlines, page breaks, pages left blank) or to the right of an insert, must be crossed out by \\nmeans of a \"Z\", so that no information may be subsequently added. The removal of any \\nlaboratory notebook page is strictly prohibited, as doing so may jeopardize the integrity of \\nthe entire notebook.\\n\\uf076All handwritten entries shall be made using permanent ink. There is no restriction on the \\nchoice of ink colors to be used, provided that the recorded information remains fully legible \\nand comprehensible in full, after black and white reproduction using a standard \\nphotocopier.\\n\\uf076Black or dark blue inks are recommended. The use of erasable ink, pencil, or \"white \\ncorrection fluid\" is not allowed. The texts and entries must be legible (any erasure must be \\nreferred to and dated, both by the editor and the witness).\\n\\uf076Any coding of information using specific colors should be avoided. If the use of colors \\ncannot be avoided, the selection of colors and/or textures must be made with careful \\nconsideration of a possible need for subsequent reproduction using a standard photocopier \\nin black and white.\\n\\uf076On each page containing an entry, the name of the project and laboratory notebook \\nnumber must be entered in the designated location at the top of the page.14GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017NOTEBOOK AND METHODS \\n2.2. General Rules Regarding Substance\\nEach test, experiment, or analysis, whether positive or negative, must be recorded in the \\nlaboratory record. Care should be taken to ensure that the following elements are clearly and\\nprecisely stated:\\n\\uf076The context in which the work was carried out, the objectives set and/or the problem to be \\nsolved, the working hypotheses, etc.;\\n\\uf076The experimental conditions used (protocols, particular parameters and material used ...); \\nand\\n\\uf076The results obtained, their possible interpretation, as well as any ideas, reflections or \\ncomments relating thereto.\\nAbbreviations may be used. However, abbreviations that are non-standard to persons having \\nordinary skill in the relevant field must be defined at their first appearance. Further, \\nabbreviations, along with their definition, should also be recorded after the table of \\ncontents/index section at the front of the laboratory notebook.15GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017NOTEBOOK AND METHODS \\nNote 7: If a protocol has already been previously described, in the same or different laboratory \\nnotebook, it is not necessary to reproduce the entire information for a new entry. Rather, it is \\nsufficient to simply reference the previous occurrence with particularity, i.e., the laboratory \\nnotebook number and page(s) concerned along with the name of its author. All modifications, \\nchanges, or adaptations to the referenced information must be sufficiently described. \\nReferencing scientific publications or books is permissible if identified unambiguously using a full \\nbibliographical citation.\\nNote 8: It is possible to create a separate laboratory notebook specifically reserved for recording \\nstandard laboratory or testing procedures and protocols, abbreviations, etc., and then make \\nan appropriate reference to this separate laboratory notebook.16GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017Duties of the author:\\n\\uf076Each page must be dated.\\n\\uf076Each page of the laboratory book, as soon as it is completed, must be dated and signed by \\nthe author, in the space designated for this purpose.\\n\\uf076Any mistakes or crossed-out entries, as soon as they appear in the laboratory book, must be \\ndated and signed by the author.\\n\\uf076Do not insert any information (including corrections) in a corner of a page (even if that page \\nhas not yet been countersigned by a witness).\\n\\uf076If any error or mistake is identified, the erroneous information should be clearly identified and \\ncorrected in a space immediately below the error. If there is no available space or the \\navailable space is insufficient, then corrections may be made on a subsequent page (with \\nan appropriate forward reference on the page bearing the erroneous information). If the \\ndate on which the error was found and/or corrected is different from the origin date, said \\ncorrection date should be properly recorded.\\n\\uf076Unused lines or space at the bottom of the page should be crossed out using a \"Z\" marking.\\n\\uf076In order to certify the reality of the recording, the author must have a witness sign each of \\nthe pages of his laboratory notebook within a maximum of 4 weeks after the writing of each \\nof these pages.\\n\\uf076No new information or data integration can be entered onto any page that has been \\nalready signed by a witness.NOTEBOOK AND METHODS 17GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017Duties of the witness:\\n\\uf076Read the information entered by the author/researcher to evaluate whether the level of \\ndetail is sufficient to enable its reproduction by another having ordinary skill in the relevant \\nart.\\n\\uf076Co-sign all taped or glued inserts. The date and signature must be affixed astride the insert \\nand its supporting page surface.\\n\\uf076Verify the quality of the information with regard to compliance with Mane\\'s Laboratory \\nNotebook Policy, along with laboratory recordkeeping procedures found at the front of the \\nlaboratory notebook itself.NOTEBOOK AND METHODS 18GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017\\nREVIEW, CERTIFICATION, AND ARCHIVAL \\nPROCESS19GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017REVIEW, CERTIFICATION, AND ARCHIVAL PROCESS\\n3. Certification\\nThe holder/assignee of a laboratory notebook must have it certified, twice a year at the time of \\ncertification sessions organized in May and November, by a member of Mane\\'s Legal and IP \\nDepartment. \\n•All laboratory notebooks, in progress or completed, must be submitted to the Legal and IP \\nDepartment on the working day immediately preceding the certification date. \\n•Prior to this submission, the holder of a laboratory notebook must ensure that the information \\nin each laboratory notebook is correctly recorded, including marking out any significant \\nempty space (e.g., marked out with a \"Z\"), updating the table of contents, as well as \\narranging for the proper witnessing of the notebook.\\nDuring certification, each laboratory notebook shall be inspected with regard to compliance \\nwith this policy. At the end of this inspection, the reviewer will make an entry into the notebook \\nand notate the completed inspection by affixing the reviewer\\'s stamp, date, and signature. \\nAt the end of each certification, the notebook will be promptly returned to its assignee, ideally \\nno later than the next working day after certification. \\nFor remote Innovation sites, arrangements will be made based on the volume of laboratory \\nnotebooks to enable completion of the certification process without undue expense of time or \\nresources.20GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017REVIEW, CERTIFICATION, AND ARCHIVAL PROCESS\\n4. Archiving\\nEach person assigned to a laboratory notebook is responsible for the maintenance of the\\nnotebook while it is in his/her possession. \\n•must ensure that each assigned laboratory book (s) is stored in a safe and secure location to \\nprevent loss, theft, or degradation. \\n•If a laboratory notebook is lost, stolen, or damaged, the assigned person shall immediately \\nnotify his/her supervisor. \\n•Prior to preserving an electronic copy of a laboratory notebook, the holder must ensure that \\n1) the content of the notebook meets the standards set forth in this policy, and \\n2) The notebook is certified (per Section 3 above). \\nOnce a notebook is complete and certified, the holder should make arrangements with the VP \\nof R&D to begin the laboratory notebook scanning/archiving process. \\nAfter securing an electronic archival copy of the laboratory notebook, the original hardcopy will \\nbe returned to its originally assigned holder for a reasonable period, which shall not exceed \\nthree (3) years from the date of last entry.\\nAfter the reasonable retention period, VP of R&D (or site Director) will arrange for long term \\nstorage of the notebook within a fire resistant container at the local Mane Innovation site.21GLOBAL LABORATORY NOTEBOOK POLICY\\nConfidential | November 2017CONCLUDING REMARKS\\nQUESTIONS?FOR MORE\\nINFORMATION,\\nCONTACT US\\nwww.mane.comJames.CAREY@mane.com\\n+513-239-2254']\n"
